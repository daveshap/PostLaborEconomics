# Post-Labor Economics

This is a public repository for all my research going into Post-Labor Economics, which will be used for several books. This research is too important to keep locked away. Furthermore, for the sake of rapid dissemination, robust consensus, and dialectical discussions, this repo is open source.

## Repo Structure

The `/Research` folder is the meat and potatoes of this repository. It contains many PDf reports generated by Deep Research tools. This is research directed by humans and automatically carried out by machine, representing the equivalet of thousands of hours worth of work. 

This material is to be used as research tools in the drafting of several books, but this repository is extremely valuable in its own right. Feel free to copy the PDFs into NotebookLM or other tools of your choice to discuss. 

## Participation

- Copy the PDFs to NotebookLM to rapidly interrogate the model
- Open an `Issue` here on GitHub if you spot anything glaringly wrong or obviously missing
- Start a `Discussion` here on GitHub to discuss the PLE framework
- Do NOT submit a pull request. It will be deleted and you will be banned. Zero tolerance.

## GitHub Pages

The `docs/` folder hosts an HTML version of the research. Run one of the
conversion scripts in `Research/` to generate pages before pushing updates:

```bash
python convert_pdfs_to_html.py   # better layout preservation
# or
python convert_pdfs_to_md.py     # simple Markdown text
```
