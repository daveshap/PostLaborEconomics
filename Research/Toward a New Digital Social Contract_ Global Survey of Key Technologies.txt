Toward a New Digital Social Contract: Global
Survey of Key Technologies
Programmable Digital Currencies and Payment Platforms
Ethereum and Smart Contract Blockchains
Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that introduced programmable smart contracts , enabling
a wide variety of decentralized applications beyond simple payments . Technically, Ethereum works as a
global distributed computer: anyone can deploy irreversible code (smart contracts) to the blockchain, and a
network  of  nodes  executes  these  programs  and  validates  transactions.  This  allows  creation  of
decentralized finance (DeFi)  protocols, non-fungible token markets, and organizational governance tools
without  a  central  intermediary.  Unlike  a  traditional  system  where  a  bank  or  government  mediates
transactions, Ethereum’s consensus mechanism and cryptography ensure that code-defined agreements
self-execute with transparency and security. For example, a loan or vote encoded in a smart contract will
automatically follow the rules everyone agreed to, without requiring a bank or agency to enforce it.
From a policy perspective, Ethereum operates in a gray area: it challenges existing legal frameworks by
providing an alternative infrastructure for money and contracts that is borderless and permissionless.
Regulators worldwide have grappled with classifying assets like Ether (Ethereum’s native currency) and
tokens launched on Ethereum, as these do not fit neatly into traditional definitions of currency or securities.
No single entity controls Ethereum, so enforcement of laws (like securities regulations or KYC/AML financial
rules) must happen at the periphery (e.g. exchanges or user interfaces) rather than the protocol itself. Some
governments  and  enterprises,  however ,  have  engaged  with  Ethereum  technology  via  consortia  and
private  chains  (e.g.  the  Enterprise  Ethereum  Alliance)  to  integrate  blockchain-based  efficiencies  into
existing institutions. Ethereum thus both integrates with  and circumvents  legacy systems – for instance,
anyone with internet can access Ethereum’s financial apps (increasing inclusion), but this open access also
means services can operate outside of traditional licenses or oversight.
Social contract analysis:  Ethereum’s design shifts power and agency toward network participants and
away from centralized gatekeepers. By replacing certain functions of banks, registries, or even voting
systems with transparent code, it empowers individuals to transact and organize on their own terms .
This can increase equity in access – e.g. someone in a remote region can raise funds via an Ethereum-based
crowdsale or get a loan on a DeFi platform without a bank’s permission. The blockchain’s transparency (all
transactions are publicly auditable) creates a new level of accountability compared to opaque institutional
ledgers . However , power can still concentrate in new ways: for instance, large holders of Ether or
governance tokens can influence outcomes (much like wealthy shareholders), and core developers who
maintain  the  protocol  wield  informal  influence  over  updates.  Ethereum’s  governance  is  deliberately
decentralized and consensus-driven  – changes require broad agreement from the global community of
users,  developers,  and  miners/validators .  This  high  coordination  threshold  gives  the  system
legitimacy in the eyes of its community (no single party can easily force a change) at the cost of slower
evolution. In essence, Ethereum offers a “trustless”  platform – you trust the code and distributed consensus1

over any central authority – marking a shift in the social contract toward  code as law . This raises new
questions  of  legitimacy:  Does  an  outcome  determined  purely  by  code  (e.g.  an  automatic  financial
liquidation or a hacked contract draining funds) carry the same justice as one adjudicated by courts?
Ethereum’s ecosystem is still experimenting with reconciling strict rule-by-code with human values (for
example,  the  community  hard-forked  in  2016  to  undo  the  infamous  “The  DAO”  hack,  an  extra-legal
intervention). Nonetheless, Ethereum has clearly demonstrated a new paradigm where transparency and
programmable rules  can enhance trust and enable coordination among strangers, albeit with ongoing
tension between decentralization and effectiveness.
Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)
Unlike  open  cryptocurrencies,  CBDCs  are  digital  currencies  issued  and  governed  by  states,  essentially
programmable digital cash  sanctioned by law. Two pioneering examples are China’s digital yuan  (e-CNY) and
the Bahamas’ Sand Dollar . Technically, most CBDCs are centralized or permissioned systems – the central
bank (or authorized intermediaries) runs the infrastructure, which may or may not use blockchain-like
ledgers. For instance, China’s digital yuan is issued by the People’s Bank of China and does not rely on a
public blockchain ; instead, it uses a two-tier architecture where commercial banks and payment providers
distribute  the  currency  to  users .  It  functions  similar  to  existing  mobile  payment  apps  except  that
transactions settle directly in central bank money. The e-CNY is designed to work offline and without fees,
moving value via digital wallets as easily as handing over cash . The Bahamian Sand Dollar likewise is a
centrally managed digital token equal in value to the Bahamian dollar , held in mobile wallets. Its rollout
focused on reaching residents on remote islands who lacked access to physical banks or card services
. Technically, the Sand Dollar system allows users to make instant transfers via their phones; in the
background the central bank maintains the ledger and uses authorized financial institutions to KYC (know-
your-customer) and provision wallets .
In terms of policy integration, CBDCs are explicitly crafted to fit into existing legal tender and banking
frameworks. Governments use them to extend state monetary sovereignty into the digital realm. China’s
digital yuan, for example, was showcased at the Beijing Winter Olympics and is gradually expanding from
pilot cities to nationwide use . The Chinese government has promoted e-CNY by mandating its
acceptance alongside cash, distributing small sums as incentives, and even using it for civil servant salaries
in trial regions . The policy goal is partly to improve payments efficiency and financial inclusion ,
but also to increase state oversight and control  over the economy . Officials have openly noted that a
digital currency can help monitor illicit activity, enforce currency rules, and even implement targeted
economic policies  (for example, funds that expire if not used by a certain date, or are restricted to certain
purposes) . This raises privacy concerns: the e-CNY is designed with “controllable anonymity” – small
transactions  can  have  some  privacy,  but  large  ones  are  traceable  by  authorities .  Western  security
experts have warned that such a system could enhance government surveillance or be used to sidestep
international sanctions . Meanwhile, the Bahamian Sand Dollar was introduced with an emphasis on
financial inclusion and resilience  (after hurricanes, getting physical cash to islands is hard, so a digital
alternative helps). It operates under the Central Bank of The Bahamas, which instituted regulations to
ensure Sand Dollar wallets follow anti-money-laundering rules and are only held by residents. Usage of the
Sand Dollar remains modest – under 8% of Bahamians have a wallet and the digital currency accounts for
tiny fractions of currency in circulation so far . The policy lesson  from the Bahamas is that merely
issuing  a  CBDC  is  not  enough;  public  education,  merchant  acceptance,  and  demonstrated  utility  are
needed. Still, the Sand Dollar’s legal status as equivalent to cash gives it a strong foundation to build on,5

and international observers (IMF, central banks) consider it a valuable case study in what works and what
doesn’t for CBDCs .
Social contract analysis:  CBDCs represent a digital extension of the social contract between citizens and
state regarding money. They shift power dynamics  in subtle ways. With a CBDC, individuals hold claims on
the  central  bank  directly  (digital  cash),  potentially  reducing  reliance  on  private  banks  or  payment
companies. This could  enhance citizens’ agency and equity  by providing a public, zero-cost payments
infrastructure that everyone can use – much like cash – thereby including those who are unbanked or
paying high fees to money transmitters. The Bahamas’ stated goal, for example, was to reach remote
communities and lower-income residents with a safe digital means of payment . If successful, this
can promote equity in access to finance. On the other hand, CBDCs can shift power toward the state  if not
properly designed. In China’s case, the digital yuan arguably increases the central bank’s visibility into
transactions and its ability to implement monetary policy or even social controls at the individual level
. Unlike physical cash (anonymous and untraceable), a digital currency gives authorities fine-grained
data – which could be used for good (e.g. catching fraud) or for intrusive surveillance and control of dissent.
This raises questions of legitimacy and trust  in the issuer: a democratic society might demand strong legal
safeguards (for privacy and freedom) if a CBDC is introduced, whereas in an authoritarian context the social
contract may tilt toward government prerogative. CBDCs can improve transparency  of money flows at the
macro level (central banks get real-time economic data) but reduce personal  transactional privacy. Notably,
the “social contract” of money traditionally involves implicit trust that the state won’t misuse its monetary
power; CBDCs amplify that power , so maintaining legitimacy will require new checks and balances (such as
independent oversight or technical privacy features). Another aspect is  programmability  – a CBDC can
embed  rules  (for  taxes,  subsidies,  UBI,  etc.)  directly  into  currency.  This  could  make  fiscal  policy  more
efficient or equitable (imagine stimulus money that can only go to buying necessities), effectively encoding
policy into the money itself. But again, who decides those rules and can citizens consent or appeal? In
summary, CBDCs hold promise for a more inclusive and efficient financial system aligning with public
interests, but they also challenge liberal values by granting states unprecedented control. The evolving
design and governance of CBDCs will determine whether they fortify the social contract (by  delivering
public value and retaining trust ) or erode it (through overreach into citizens’ economic lives).
MIT’s Digital Currency Research (Project Hamilton)
A notable effort in the CBDC arena is  Project Hamilton , a collaboration between MIT’s Digital Currency
Initiative and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to explore a hypothetical U.S. digital dollar . Technically,
this project produced a high-performance transaction processor that could handle an enormous volume of
payments with minimal latency . Unlike many blockchain systems, the prototype was not a classical
blockchain  but a more centralized architecture optimized for speed and resilience, capable of processing
hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. Interestingly, the team did make the system compatible
with  smart  contracts  (it  could  support  Ethereum-like  contract  logic)  but  without  the  energy-intensive
distributed mining – it’s an example of designing digital currency tech tailored for central bank use . MIT
released the code open-source (OpenCBDC), emphasizing transparency and public input into CBDC design
. The project was exploratory and explicitly not a pilot or actual currency; rather , it aimed to inform
policymakers about what’s possible and how design choices (like account-based vs token-based models)
affect security, privacy, and performance .
In policy terms, Project Hamilton served as a bridge between academia and central bankers. It doesn’t
interact with legal frameworks yet (since the U.S. has not decided to issue a CBDC), but it has influenced the1918

policy  discussion  by  demonstrating,  for  example,  that  a  digital  dollar  could  be  built  to  combine  high
throughput with privacy protections . One outcome is that it dispelled the notion that a CBDC must run
on  a  slow,  fully  decentralized  blockchain  –  showing  that  other  architectures  can  meet  central  bank
requirements . This gives policymakers more options to chew on (e.g. a two-tier model where the Fed
provides the core ledger and private firms handle user-facing wallets, akin to how cash is distributed by
banks  today).  The  project’s  openness  (publishing  a  whitepaper  and  code)  also  set  a  standard  for
transparency – a stark contrast to more secretive state projects. While the Fed has not committed to a
CBDC, research like this prepares the institutional groundwork (legal and technical) if the decision is made.
It also feeds into legitimacy : any U.S. digital dollar would need broad public and political buy-in, and MIT’s
involvement adds credibility that design choices are being vetted for public good (e.g. robust security,
avoiding single points of failure, and considering user privacy).
Social contract analysis:  Although just a research project, Hamilton highlights how technological design
can encode the values  we want in a new social contract for money. By exploring an  open-source and
technically inclusive  approach, it implicitly argues that a future digital dollar should be a public good, not a
corporate product. This touches on power and agency – in a world of digital payments dominated by private
Big Tech platforms, a state-issued, open infrastructure could give individuals more agency (no need to rely
on a tech giant that might lock you out or exploit your data). If the public through democratic institutions
influences CBDC design (as MIT’s open approach encourages), then issues like equity (universal access)
and privacy rights  can be built into the technology from day one. For instance, the Hamilton prototypes
considered modes for offline transactions  (so people could pay even during internet outages) and examined
how to avoid centralizing too much information (perhaps via cryptographic tricks or distributing the ledger
among  intermediaries).  These  technical  features  correspond  to  social  values:  offline  capability  boosts
resilience and inclusion  (rural or poor communities with patchy internet won’t be left out), while minimizing
data  collection  protects  individual  liberty .  In  contrast,  if  such  a  currency  were  solely  engineered  for
maximum control or efficiency without regard to rights, it might undermine trust. Thus, Project Hamilton
represents a consultative, public-interest-driven approach  – arguably a more legitimate social contract
for digital currency  in a democracy. It acknowledges that how we design our digital money will shape the
power relations between citizens, banks, and state . A well-designed CBDC could empower citizens with a
safe, accessible means of exchange guaranteed by the state (much like cash does), while also giving the
state new tools to serve the public (like direct stimulus payments). Ensuring that power is not a one-way
street (all to the state) is crucial – and projects like this show that we can bake in checks (e.g. tiered
anonymity, so small purchases are private) and balances (e.g. audits and open code for transparency). In
summary, MIT’s digital currency research contributes to a social contract discussion by injecting  technical
knowledge, transparency, and public values  into what could otherwise be a top-down implementation of a
very impactful technology.
Self-Sovereign and Digital Identity Systems
Figure: Conceptual illustration of a decentralized identity network. Self-sovereign identity technologies aim to give
individuals direct control over their personal data and credentials in a connected system.
Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Networks – Sovrin and Beyond
Digital identity is a cornerstone of the social contract – it defines who is recognized by institutions and how
individuals assert and protect their rights.  Self-sovereign identity (SSI)  is a movement and technology
stack that re-imagines identity as a user-centric asset rather than something solely issued and owned by24
4
central authorities. In an SSI system, individuals have digital identity credentials (e.g. proofs of their name,
qualifications,  or  entitlements)  that  are  cryptographically  signed  by  issuers  (like  governments,
universities, banks) but controlled by the individual  in a secure digital wallet. A key innovation enabling
this is the concept of decentralized identifiers (DIDs)  and verifiable credentials, standardized by W3C. The
Sovrin Network is a prominent example of an SSI infrastructure. Technically, Sovrin is a public-permissioned
blockchain (built on Hyperledger Indy) that serves as a global ledger for DIDs and credential schemas
. It doesn’t store personal data on-chain; rather , it stores cryptographic public keys and proofs  needed
to verify credentials offline. Sovrin is run by a decentralized network of “Stewards” (trusted organizations
operating nodes) under a governance framework that treats the network as a public utility . When
someone (say Alice) wants to prove her identity or a claim about herself, she can present a verifiable
credential (like a digital diploma or an ID card) to a verifier . The verifier can check the digital signature
against  the  issuer’s  public  key,  which  is  fetched  from  the  Sovrin  ledger ,  to  ensure  it’s  authentic  and
untampered.  Advanced  cryptography  like  zero-knowledge  proofs  is  used  so  Alice  can  reveal  just  the
necessary information (e.g. “I am over 18” without revealing her exact birthdate) . In summary, SSI tech
like Sovrin provides the technical means for portable, user-controlled identity  across the internet – akin
to showing your driver’s license in person, but online and without always disclosing all details.
From a policy and institutional standpoint, SSI networks interface in novel ways with traditional identity
regimes. Rather than replacing government IDs, SSI extends them: a government could issue a digital ID
credential to a citizen’s wallet, and the citizen could then use it widely without new integrations each time,
because verification is standard and decentralized. Sovrin’s governance framework was developed to ensure
compliance with laws (e.g. data protection regulations like GDPR) and to delineate liability of issuers and
verifiers. However , SSI does challenge the monopoly and silo  model of identity. For example, today a bank
identity check might rely on scanning a passport or querying a government database; with SSI, the passport
office could have digitally signed Alice’s identity credential, and Alice can directly present it to the bank. The
bank doesn’t need to call the government – it trusts the digital signature via the blockchain. This reduces
the  dependence  on  central  data  silos  and  potentially  the  load  on  agencies,  but  it  requires  legal
recognition that a credential shown by the user is as valid as one fetched by the institution. Governments in
Canada, Europe, and elsewhere have run pilots using Sovrin/Indy tech for things like business registrations
and inter-agency data sharing, precisely to test this integration. One  friction point  is establishing trust
frameworks: agreeing on which issuers are trusted for which attributes (e.g. only a DMV can issue a driver’s
license credential, only an accredited university can issue a degree credential, etc.). Sovrin’s approach has
been to form a nonprofit foundation to curate governance and promote interoperability so that, say, a
healthcare credential issued in one country could be understood and accepted in another . In essence, policy
is catching up to allow individual-centric credential portability  – the EU, for instance, in its forthcoming
digital identity wallet framework (see below) heavily borrows from SSI concepts.
Social contract analysis:  Self-sovereign identity shifts power over personal data and identity assertions
from central authorities to individuals . Under the traditional model, one’s identity “exists” in myriad
databases – you have a citizenship record in a government registry, a customer profile at each bank, a
student record at a university, etc., and you depend on those entities to vouch for you when needed. SSI
inverts this: you become the point of integration for your identity , holding cryptographic proofs from
those entities. This enhances individual agency – you decide when  and with whom  to share which aspect of
your  identity,  rather  than  leaving  that  to  siloed  institutions  (which  might  share  data  without  your
knowledge). It can also improve privacy and equity . Privacy, because only the minimum necessary info is
disclosed and there’s no need for verifiers to continually query big databases (reducing surveillance and
honeypots of data). Equity, because individuals who historically lack identity documents or struggle to26

access them might leapfrog to digital credentials that are widely accepted – for example, refugees could
carry verifiable education certificates issued by now-defunct institutions, or the homeless could retain ID
credentials without physical documents. SSI could empower marginalized groups by giving them a portable
trust mechanism  not dependent on always going back to the issuer (who might be out of reach or
prejudiced). The social contract implications are significant: trust in society would be more peer-to-peer ,
mediated  by  cryptography.  This  might  increase  overall  transparency  and  legitimacy  –  if  a  landlord
verifies a tenant’s income via a verifiable credential from an employer , they aren’t prying into all finances,
just  getting  a  yes/no  proof.  It’s  transparent  in  terms  of  authenticity  (they  know  it’s  legit)  but  privacy-
preserving in content. There are challenges too: not everyone is capable of managing cryptographic keys
safely, so questions arise about guardianship, digital literacy, and ensuring no one is left behind  (the social
contract  must  still  protect  those  who  use  paper).  Additionally,  SSI  networks  like  Sovrin  introduce  new
stewards and governance bodies – the trust shifts partly to these network maintainers. The legitimacy of an
SSI system will depend on open governance and accountability  (so that, for instance, the organizations
running the ledger cannot collude or be coerced to falsify records). Sovrin’s governance framework is an
attempt at this, treating identity as a public utility with checks and balances . In summary, SSI offers
a vision of identity that  respects individual autonomy and privacy by default . If widely adopted, it could
recalibrate  the  social  contract  around  personal  data:  individuals  become  active  managers  of  their
identity ,  and  institutions  must  request  consent  and  trust  user-presented  data  instead  of  hoarding
information. This represents a more  egalitarian and agency-enhancing model  of identity – essentially
shifting  some  power  from  bureaucracies  to  people ,  while  ideally  retaining  (or  even  boosting)  trust
through cryptographic guarantees rather than human oversight alone.
European Digital Identity and EIDAS 2.0 (EBSI and Digital Wallet Pilots)
In  the  public-sector  domain,  the  European  Union  is  spearheading  a  blend  of  centralized  policy  and
decentralized technology for digital identity. In 2021, the EU proposed an  eIDAS 2.0 regulation  that will
require every Member State to offer a European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet  to citizens and residents by
2026 . This wallet is essentially a mobile app that can store verified digital IDs and credentials (from
government-issued ID cards to diplomas, driver’s licenses, professional certificates, etc.) and allow the user
to control and share them across borders. The vision is explicitly influenced by SSI principles: EU lawmakers
want citizens to  gain more control over how their data is handled  and to  enable seamless, privacy-
preserving  authentication  for  online  services .  To  implement  this,  they  are  leveraging  the
European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI)  – a pan-European distributed ledger network run
jointly by EU countries. EBSI is not a public, permissionless blockchain like Ethereum; it’s a permissioned
network where nodes are operated by member state authorities. One of EBSI’s key use cases is  digital
identity  and  credentials  verification .  For  example,  the  EU  has  piloted  cross-border  digital  diploma
verification: a university in one country issues a graduate’s diploma as a verifiable credential, anchored on
EBSI, and an employer in another country can instantly verify its authenticity via the ledger , rather than
exchanging paper and stamps. The IOTA Foundation and other tech providers participated in early EBSI
pilots, experimenting with DLT-based  identity management under a single protocol  that could unify
many national systems . Essentially, EBSI provides an EU-controlled backbone to verify signatures
and status of credentials, complementing the eIDAS legal framework which gives these digital signatures
legal effect.
From a policy integration standpoint, the EU approach is top-down but innovative. The original eIDAS
(Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services) regulation (2014) allowed cross-recognition of
national e-ID schemes, but uptake was limited. EIDAS 2.0 is a game-changer: it compels member states to2829
3031
3233
3334
6
adopt a common technical standards (likely the W3C Verifiable Credentials and DID standards) and to
recognize each other’s digital identity means via the wallet . Because it’s regulatory, it overcomes the
trust issue by fiat: if a country issues a credential into the wallet, all other countries must accept it as proof
per eIDAS law. At the same time, the architecture is relatively decentralized and user-centric – credentials
are stored at the user’s side and shared only as needed . The state doesn’t get a log each time you show
your ID to a private company in another country, for instance. The EU is financing large-scale pilots (with
tens of millions of euros) to test use cases like opening a bank account across border with the wallet, or
proving  one’s  age  on  a  social  network  without  revealing  identity .  The  integration  with  legal
frameworks is explicit: the wallet will be legally valid for things like KYC (know-your-customer checks) in
finance, e-prescriptions across countries, signing documents, etc. . This is one of the first instances of a
supranational  policy  embracing  SSI :  by  mandating  interoperable,  user-controlled  wallets ,  the  EU  is
effectively challenging Big Tech’s single sign-on systems (like logging in with Google or Facebook) and
asserting a digital public infrastructure  for identity. It also raises the bar on privacy – the regulation talks
about selective disclosure  and minimizing data, in line with GDPR principles.
Social contract analysis:  The EU’s digital identity initiative can be seen as a renewal of the social contract in
the digital age, led by government but empowering the individual. It enhances citizen agency  by giving
everyone a state-backed tool to identify themselves online without relying on commercial providers. In
terms of power: currently, large platforms often mediate digital identity (think of how many sites rely on
Google/Facebook logins or how your data is brokered by companies). In the new model,  power shifts
toward citizens and the state  as primary identity providers, sidelining middlemen. However , it’s a nuanced
shift: the state is providing the tool (wallet) and base credentials, but the citizen wields it. One might say it
tries to  re-balance power between Big Tech and individuals/governments . The social contract here
emphasizes  trust  and  transparency :  because  the  digital  wallet  is  implemented  under  law,  there  are
accountability mechanisms. European residents can expect certain rights – e.g. that their wallet data won’t
be harvested for ads (unlike commercial IDs) and that they can see and control every attribute release. This
fosters  legitimacy and trust in digital interactions : If you use your EU wallet to prove your age to an
online service, you know that only the fact of you being an adult is revealed, not your name or ID number ,
and that this method is legally recognized . This could reduce the current mistrust in digital life
where people feel they have lost privacy. By building privacy into the official system (with techniques like
pseudonymous verification keys on EBSI and selective disclosure), the transparency shifts  – you as a user
get  more  transparency  about  who  is  requesting  your  data  and  why ,  while  large  institutions  get  less
unnecessary info. In theory, this should enhance equity  as well: all residents, not just those who can afford
premium identity protection services, get a high-quality identity tool for free. It may particularly help mobile
EU citizens (students, workers across borders) and those in smaller countries who previously had trouble
getting their IDs recognized abroad. The introduction of data minimization and user consent as standard
practice  changes the social norms – it legitimizes the idea that you shouldn’t have to hand over more data
than  needed ,  shifting  the  expectation  of  privacy.  There  are  still  open  questions:  Will  people  trust  a
government-issued app more than, say, Apple’s or Google’s wallet? The social contract between citizen and
state in Europe includes a relatively high trust in regulators to enforce privacy (GDPR), so leveraging that
trust to reclaim ground from unregulated digital identities is strategic. If successful, the outcome is a
strengthening  of  democratic  values  (privacy,  personal  autonomy)  in  the  digital  realm,  with  the
government actively safeguarding those values through technology. It is a melding of the  decentralized
ethos  (take control of your identity) with the  legitimacy of state authority  (so it’s widely accepted and
protected by law). This combination could set a precedent globally for how digital public infrastructure can
enhance individual rights rather than eroding them, marking a positive evolution of the social contract as
societies digitize.3536

National Digital ID Initiatives (Estonia’s E-State and Others)
On the national level, countries like  Estonia  and  India  have built sweeping digital identity systems that
underpin  broader  digital  governance.  Estonia  is  often  cited  as  a  model  digital  society  –  it  provides  a
compulsory e-ID card  (and mobile ID) to all citizens and residents, which is used to access virtually every
government service online, to sign documents, and even to vote in elections. The  technical overview :
Estonia’s system relies on strong cryptography (each ID has private-public key pairs) and a distributed data
exchange layer called X-Road  to link databases. When a citizen authenticates with their ID card or mobile-
ID, they can fetch or submit data across different agencies seamlessly . For instance, if you move
house, updating your address in one place updates it for all agencies – a “once-only” principle. The X-Road
infrastructure logs every data exchange, and those logs are in part secured by blockchain-like integrity
proofs (Estonia was an early adopter of the KSI blockchain to timestamp records) . On top of this,
Estonia has rolled out dozens of services: e-Tax (98% file taxes online), e-Health records (with patients
controlling access), e-Residency (a program giving foreigners a digital identity to start businesses remotely),
and i-Voting  (internet voting in national elections) . All government services are available through a
single portal, and 99% of services are online (you only need to visit in person for very few things like
marriage). Notably, transparency is built in : citizens can log into a state portal and see which officials have
accessed their data (e.g., which police officer queried your driver’s license info), providing oversight against
misuse. In India, by contrast, the  Aadhaar  system provides a biometric digital identity to over a billion
people. Aadhaar issues a unique 12-digit ID linked to fingerprints and iris scans in a central database.
Technically, it’s a centralized system that authenticates identity via biometrics or OTP, allowing residents to
access services or open bank accounts without traditional documents. Aadhaar doesn’t itself carry other
attributes (like address or entitlements), but it has become the foundational ID that other databases use as
a key.
Policy-wise, these national ID infrastructures are deeply integrated into the state’s legal and administrative
framework. Estonia’s digital ID is legally equivalent to a handwritten signature . Laws were passed to
recognize digital documents and to mandate data sharing between agencies (so citizens are not asked for
the same info twice). Estonia also reformed its legal codes to enable online voting and to accept the
legitimacy of logs as evidence. One remarkable policy aspect is e-Residency : Estonia extended parts of its
digital identity system beyond its citizens, allowing entrepreneurs worldwide to legally register companies
in Estonia and manage them online with an e-ID (though not granting citizenship rights). This blurs the
traditional social contract of nation-state and citizen, creating a new category of digital stakeholder in a
state. In India, Aadhaar was voluntary at first but became quasi-mandatory for accessing welfare and even
private services (telcos, banks) – until the Supreme Court intervened to curtail some uses in 2018, citing
privacy concerns. The  social contract tensions  were evident: the government argued Aadhaar would
ensure  equity and inclusion  (e.g., eliminating ghost beneficiaries and guaranteeing subsidies reach the
poor directly), while critics worried about state surveillance and the exclusion of those whose fingerprints
don’t scan well (the elderly, laborers). Legally, India enacted a law to govern Aadhaar and created a national
data protection law as a response to privacy issues. Both Estonia and India illustrate how digital IDs can
redefine the relationship between state and individual  – potentially increasing the state’s ability to
deliver services and the individual’s convenience, but also requiring new rights and protections.
Social contract analysis:  A robust digital ID infrastructure can greatly shift power, agency, and trust  in
society. In Estonia, the effect has largely been to  empower citizens as digital participants . Because
everyone has a secure digital identity,  participation in governance is easier (e-voting)  and accessing
one’s rights (filing for benefits, registering a business) is straightforward and quick. This reduces inequality3940

in access – e.g., rural citizens get the same quality of service via internet as city-dwellers, and bureaucratic
discretion or petty corruption is minimized when processes are automated. The transparency of Estonia’s
system  enhances its legitimacy: knowing that your data accesses are tracked and visible to you builds trust
that the government isn’t misusing information. Indeed, Estonia reports high public trust in its digital
services, arguably because the social contract was carefully managed – citizens are educated about digital
safety, and the government has proven itself a reliable custodian (there have been no major data breaches
of the X-Road, and even when a flaw was found in the physical ID cards’ chip security, authorities acted
quickly and openly to replace certificates) . The power relations shifted in that public servants have
less arbitrary power  – since processes are digitized and standardized, there’s little room for an official to
“lose your file” or demand a bribe. At the same time, the Estonian state itself became highly efficient and
somewhat more powerful in capability (it can respond or adapt quickly because data flows freely between
its  organs).  The  legitimacy  of  the  Estonian  government  arguably  increased:  fulfilling  the  modern
expectation that government should be as efficient and user-friendly as a digital service, it strengthened
citizens’  perception  that  the  state  delivers  value  for  their  consent  and  taxes.  It  also  introduced  novel
concepts like “data embassy”  – Estonia stores encrypted data backups in other countries, treating data as
critical national infrastructure. This again is part of the social contract: the state commits to safeguarding
citizen data even under existential threats (like cyber-attacks or invasion), akin to protecting the populace
itself.
In India, the Aadhaar experience shows both the positive and cautionary sides of rewriting the social
contract with tech. On one hand, Aadhaar gave millions of people a formal identity for the first time, which
is fundamental to accessing rights (you can’t get welfare or vote easily if you lack ID). This inclusion is a big
equity gain – it’s often said “identity is the gateway to opportunities.” It also helped reduce certain forms of
corruption (ghost recipients in welfare rolls were eliminated, saving public money). So, in that sense, the
power  shifted  toward  ordinary  people  who  now  reliably  receive  their  entitlements  directly  into  bank
accounts  linked  to  Aadhaar ,  rather  than  trickling  through  corrupt  intermediaries.  However ,  the
centralization and biometric nature of Aadhaar raised concerns about state power and individual privacy.
Unlike Estonia’s decentralized X-Road model, Aadhaar put a vast amount of personal info (biometrics and
authentication  logs)  in  one  database,  which  some  see  as  an  instrument  of  surveillance.  When  the
government started requiring Aadhaar for more and more services, it felt coercive – citizens were suddenly
forced to link all aspects of their life to a single ID. The social contract tension here was: do citizens get
enough benefit (in convenience and services) to justify giving the state (and possibly private companies) the
ability to track their activities via a unified ID? Civil society pushed back, leading to court rulings that, for
example, private telecom companies can’t demand Aadhaar , and that a law was needed with limits on
usage. This reflects a negotiation of legitimacy: a digital ID system must maintain trust by protecting
rights, not just by preventing abuse but by being seen to prevent it . As a result, India is working on a
Data Protection Act and features like offline Aadhaar IDs to appease privacy concerns. This trajectory
underscores that digital ID systems can enhance or undermine legitimacy  depending on governance. If
implemented with transparency, choice, and security, they strengthen the social contract by improving
service delivery and inclusion (citizens see the government working better for them). If implemented in a
coercive or surveillance-heavy way, they risk eroding trust and agency (citizens feel watched or forced,
which is corrosive to the voluntary trust that underpins any social contract).
In summary, national digital ID initiatives show that technology can  dramatically improve the citizen-
state relationship  – making it more efficient, fair , and participatory – but they must be accompanied by
robust safeguards and an ethical framework. The “digital social contract” in these cases means the state
promises to use tech to benefit people (no more waiting in line for hours, more equitable access), and the4546

people,  in  turn,  trust  the  state  with  more  data/power ,  expecting  it  to  be  used  responsibly.  Estonia
exemplifies a well-balanced outcome (earning the moniker “digital republic” for how it married liberty and
efficiency ),  while  others  are  learning  that  finding  the  right  balance  of  power,  agency,  and
transparency  is key to legitimacy in the digital age.
Proof-of-Personhood and Worldcoin
A novel entry in the identity domain is  Worldcoin , a private project blending biometrics, cryptocurrency,
and the concept of a global basic income. Worldcoin’s approach to digital identity is through  “proof-of-
personhood” : it aims to issue everyone a unique digital ID (World ID) that proves they are a real, individual
human  –  without  revealing  their  actual  identity .  Technically,  Worldcoin  devised  a  physical  imaging
device (the Orb) which scans an individual’s iris to create a unique biometric hash. This hash is then used to
issue a World ID (a cryptographic token) that the person can use in online interactions to prove “I am a
unique human” (and not a bot or duplicate) . Importantly, the system employs  zero-knowledge
proofs  so that the World ID does not contain the biometric itself – the iris image is converted to a code that
can be checked for uniqueness, and the original image isn’t supposed to be stored (or so the project claims)
. With a World ID, a person could log in to websites or services anonymously but verifiably human,
solving the problem of bots and fake accounts proliferating in the age of AI . On top of the ID,
Worldcoin also has a cryptocurrency (WLD) which it distributes in part to people who sign up – essentially
providing an incentive (some free tokens) for undergoing the iris scan . The broader vision espoused by
Worldcoin’s founders is to lay the groundwork for a universal basic income (UBI)  in the future by having a
global registry of humans (so you could, for instance, drop airdrops of money to everyone exactly once) .
In July 2023, Worldcoin launched and by that time had over 2 million sign-ups from trial deployments in
various countries .
Policy integration and challenges around Worldcoin are substantial. As a private, globe-spanning initiative,
it doesn’t fit neatly under any single regulatory regime for identity or finance. Immediately, data privacy
regulators  in  various  countries  scrutinized  Worldcoin’s  collection  of  sensitive  biometric  data.  Kenya
suspended Worldcoin  shortly after launch, citing concerns over data protection and even national security
.  European  authorities  also  opened  investigations,  as  EU  law  (GDPR)  has  stringent  rules  about
processing biometrics – consent must be explicit, purpose-limited, and there are doubts whether primarily
offering  a  financial  incentive  (free  crypto)  is  valid  consent.  Worldcoin’s  model  effectively  leapfrogs
government ID to create a new kind of ID – this can be seen as disruptive or complementary. On one hand,
proof-of-personhood could greatly help in digital governance: e.g., one person–one-vote online polls or
distributing aid fairly. But if a private company controls the database of unique humans, it raises questions
of sovereignty and oversight . No state is formally involved in verifying or backing these identities; it’s all
via technology and the company’s Orb devices. This can clash with laws that require certain ID verification
(for  instance,  you  still  need  a  government  ID  to  exchange  Worldcoin  tokens  for  cash  on  regulated
exchanges due to KYC laws; a World ID alone isn’t a legal identity document). Some jurisdictions might ban
or regulate the biometric aspect – requiring Worldcoin to have licenses for handling sensitive data. Another
policy  aspect  is  financial  regulation :  Worldcoin’s  token  distribution  to  possibly  billions  of  people  is
unprecedented. If widely adopted, the WLD token could have monetary significance, raising issues for
central banks or securities regulators (is it an unregistered security distribution?). The project thus sits at
the  frontier  of  law,  likely  needing  new  rules  if  it  grows  (perhaps  classified  as  critical  personal  data
infrastructure  or  subject  to  something  akin  to  how  passports  are  handled,  but  globally).  Right  now,
integration  with  state  frameworks  is  minimal  –  rather ,  Worldcoin  is  attempting  to  create  a  parallel
infrastructure and hoping for tacit acceptance. It is also  challenging institutions  by positing that a private45

initiative can do what traditionally only governments did: guarantee uniqueness of an identity on a global
scale.
Social contract analysis:  Worldcoin is a provocative experiment in how technology might reconfigure
power and trust at a planetary scale. It posits a new kind of social contract:  each human  gets a crypto
identity and potentially an economic stake, managed by a transnational system of algorithms and devices,
rather than by nation-states. This carries some  utopian promises and dystopian risks . On the positive
side, if something like World ID became widely accepted, it could  democratize access to the digital
economy  and  perhaps  to  future  social  benefits .  For  example,  in  an  AI-dominated  future  where
distinguishing real humans is hard (to prevent bot abuse or ensure fair resource allocation), having a proof-
of-personhood could empower individuals to claim their voice (one human, one account) and even a share
of AI-generated wealth (the UBI idea) . In that vision,  agency and equity  are enhanced globally: a
person in a poor country might have the same World ID and same claim to certain global distributions as
someone in a rich country. It bypasses the lottery of citizenship and could be a leveller , establishing a kind
of global citizenship in economic terms . It also could increase transparency in online interactions – one could
demand  that  voting  or  reviews  are  by  verified  humans,  cleaning  up  digital  discourse  and  improving
legitimacy of online communities (no more armies of bots drowning out real opinions). However , these
benefits come only if people trust the system – and that’s where the power dynamics raise eyebrows. Right
now, a private foundation/companies control the Orb manufacturing, the initial token allocation, and the
backend algorithms. This  centralizes power in the hands of Worldcoin’s operators  (and investors) in a
way  that  might  be  even  less  accountable  than  governments.  Unlike  a  democratic  state  bound  by
constitution, Worldcoin’s governance is not yet transparent – though they talk of eventually decentralizing,
currently users must trust  that the biometric hashing is secure and that their data won’t be misused. There’s
a troubling scenario: if such an ID became critical and the organization behind it failed or acted maliciously,
people  could  lose  an  essential  credential  or  be  subject  to  surveillance  without  recourse.  Thus  the
legitimacy  of Worldcoin’s approach is contested – privacy advocates call it “dystopian, a trade of biometrics
for tokens”  and worry about exploitation (early deployments targeted poorer communities with the allure of
free crypto) . The transparency  in how the system actually works and how data is stored is also under
question; the company claims to delete raw images, but outsiders have limited ways to verify these claims. 
In essence, Worldcoin’s social contract is trying to leap beyond the nation-state: “trust this technology and
organization with your biometric, and in return, you get a secure digital identity and a share in a new global
economy.” This is a radical reshaping of power relations – potentially weakening the role of states (who
traditionally  provide  IDs  and  social  safety  nets)  and  strengthening  a  techno-economic  network  as  the
guarantor of some rights (the right to a global basic income, perhaps, or the right to a verified voice online).
If Worldcoin or similar projects succeed, we might see a shift where  people hold multiple overlapping
social contracts : one with their country (citizenship) and one with global networks (e.g., Worldcoin ID
holders, members of a global DAO, etc.), each granting different benefits and requiring different forms of
trust. This pluralism could empower individuals (giving them alternatives if their state fails them) or confuse
loyalty and accountability (to whom do you turn if the system breaks?). The notion of legitimacy will have to
be extended – beyond governmental legitimacy to  technological legitimacy , earned by openness and
fairness. For now, the pushback Worldcoin has received highlights a fundamental point:  no new social
contract can survive without trust , and trust must be earned by transparency, inclusivity, and clear
benefit. Worldcoin has started a conversation about proof-of-personhood  as a public good, but whether it
evolves into something that communities accept and govern (perhaps as a decentralized public utility) or
remains a controversial private venture will determine if it truly reshapes the social contract or just becomes
a footnote. In summary, Worldcoin illuminates both the aspiration of a borderless digital social contract52

– equality and agency for all humans in cyberspace – and the  pragmatic challenges  of achieving that
without creating new concentrations of power or violating fundamental rights like privacy and consent
.
Decentralized Governance and DAOs
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and New Governance Models
DAOs  are organizations represented and run by rules encoded as smart contracts on a blockchain, with
decisions  often  made  by  token-holding  members  voting  on  proposals.  They  embody  a  new  form  of
governance  that  is  natively  digital  and  potentially  global,  without  a  centralized  leadership  hierarchy.
Technically, a DAO typically consists of a set of smart contracts (often on Ethereum or similar platforms) that
manage a treasury of tokens and implement governance processes. For example, a DAO might have a
contract where members can submit proposals (e.g. to fund a project or change a parameter) and then vote
during a fixed period. If the proposal passes per the encoded rules (say, >50% quorum and approval), the
smart contract automatically executes the decision – for instance, transferring funds or updating variables.
This automated execution  means that once the community’s will (as measured by votes) is expressed, the
outcome isn’t dependent on any single person to carry out; the blockchain enforces it impartially .
The first high-profile DAO, known simply as “The DAO” in 2016, sought to be a decentralized venture capital
fund. It raised $150 million in Ether from thousands of participants with no centralized management – an
unprecedented experiment, until a hack exploited its code. Despite that rocky start, today there are many
functioning  DAOs:  from  protocol  DAOs  that  govern  blockchain  projects  (e.g.,  MakerDAO  governing  a
stablecoin system, Uniswap’s DAO governing a decentralized exchange) to  investment DAOs  (collective
funds like Flamingo DAO for NFT art),  social DAOs  (communities like Friends With Benefits), and  service
DAOs  (decentralized freelance collectives). 
Major  DAO  governance  models  have  emerged,  each  with  different  implications  for  participation  and
power . The most common is token-weighted voting : members hold governance tokens and usually one
token  equals  one  vote .  This  model  mirrors  shareholder  voting  in  corporations  and  is  easy  to
implement. However , it often leads to  whale domination  – those with large token holdings (often early
investors or wealthy backers) can disproportionately influence or even dictate outcomes . Some
DAOs have mitigated this by introducing delegated voting (liquid democracy) , where token holders can
assign their voting power to delegates who vote on proposals on their behalf (Compound and MakerDAO
follow this model) . Delegation can lead to more informed decision-making (delegates specialize and
research  issues)  and  reduce  voter  apathy,  but  it  also  introduces  a  representative  layer  –  potentially
recreating a mini political class within the DAO, which could centralize influence if not checked .
Another  model  is  quadratic  voting/quadratic  funding  used  experimentally  by  DAOs  like  Gitcoin  for
community grants. In quadratic voting, the cost of additional votes grows quadratically, so a person with
100 tokens doesn’t get 100 votes for free – it might cost them 10,000 tokens’ worth of voting power to cast
100 votes (simplified example) . This way, the influence of large holders is dampened  and broad
support matters more than raw capital – it’s more “one person, one vote” in spirit, though still not exactly
that if tokens can be split among identities. Quadratic funding, similarly, matches funds based on number
of contributors rather than size of contributions . Few governance decisions use pure quadratic
voting due to complexity, but the concept is influential as a way to inject more equity  (small token holders
banding together can outweigh a whale). There’s also  conviction voting  (used by 1Hive), where votes
accumulate  weight  over  time,  favoring  long-term  stakers  over  quick  flippers .  Some  DAOs  use
reputation-based voting  instead of transferable tokens – members earn non-tradable “reputation” points48

through  contributions,  which  determine  voting  power .  This  can  align  power  with  merit  or
participation rather than wealth, but setting and maintaining the reputation system is complex and can be
subjective. Lastly, some governance is multisig or committee-based  (a multi-signature wallet controlled by
a small group), particularly for executing sensitive decisions or as a backstop for security . Many DAOs
actually use a mix: for instance, off-chain Snapshot  polls for informal voting, followed by on-chain execution
by a multisig if the vote passes – blending decentralization with a bit of human oversight for safety.
Legally and institutionally, DAOs operate in a gray zone, but this is changing. They inherently challenge the
traditional legal notion of corporations or nonprofits. A DAO doesn’t map neatly to any existing entity: it
might have no registration, no address, its “members” are pseudonymous wallet addresses around the
world, and its “charter” is open-source code on GitHub. This has posed issues – for example, if a DAO gets
sued, who is liable? If it wants to sign a contract with a real-world vendor , who signs? Recognizing this gap,
some jurisdictions have started to integrate DAOs into legal frameworks.  Wyoming’s DAO legislation
(2021) was groundbreaking: it allows DAOs to register as a special form of LLC (Limited Liability Company) in
Wyoming . This means a DAO can obtain legal entity status – it files an LLC operating agreement that
can reference its smart contracts and bylaws, and it must have a registered agent in the state, but otherwise
can operate using its on-chain governance. Wyoming even updated this in 2024 to create a new category
called Decentralized Autonomous Nonprofit Associations (DUNA) , granting DAOs legal personhood as
unincorporated associations with limited liability for members . Key features include recognizing the
use of blockchain for governance, protecting individual members from being personally liable for DAO
debts,  and  allowing  DAOs  to  own  property,  sue  and  be  sued,  etc.,  just  like  companies .  This
integration is significant – it lends  legitimacy and legal clarity  to DAOs, encouraging experimentation
within the bounds of law. Other places like Vermont, Tennessee, and even overseas (e.g., Malta, and a
special  zone  in  the  UAE)  have  also  introduced  DAO-friendly  laws  or  frameworks .  On  the  flip  side,
regulators like the U.S. SEC and CFTC have asserted that  DAOs are not above the law  – if a DAO sells
tokens that function like securities, it must comply with securities laws . In 2023, the CFTC even took
enforcement action against a DeFi protocol’s DAO (Ooki DAO), treating the voting token holders as an
unincorporated association responsible for legal violations, which was a wake-up call: participating in a DAO
doesn’t magically shield one from legal responsibility unless it’s formally wrapped in a legal entity. So DAOs
are pushing the envelope, and the legal system is gradually responding by either offering incorporation
pathways (to bring DAOs into the fold) or by pursuing them under existing laws (to not let them become
lawless zones).
Social contract analysis:  DAOs are a laboratory for  reimagining governance – who holds power and
how  decisions  gain  legitimacy  –  beyond  the  constraints  of  geography  and  traditional  organizational
charts. They shift power by potentially  flattening hierarchies : in a pure DAO, there is no CEO or board;
token holders collectively decide. This can be highly empowering for individuals: anyone with some tokens
(often earnable through contribution, not just purchase) has a voice in decisions that matter to them,
whether it’s managing a community treasury, deciding on project direction, or setting community rules. In
that  sense,  DAOs  strive  to  embody  a  more  participatory  and  meritocratic  social  contract  within
organizations: if you contribute value, you gain influence (as with reputation systems), and every member’s
vote  is  counted  transparently.  The  transparency  of  DAO  governance  is  a  strong  point  –  proposals,
discussions (usually on forums or Discord), and on-chain votes are open for all to see . This level of
openness can increase trust among members compared to a black-box corporation; decisions are justified
in public, and records are immutable on the blockchain for audit. It’s a bit of Rousseau’s social contract ideal
(direct participation of citizens) implemented with code and tokens.3869

However , the reality has been mixed. Token-based voting often replicates plutocracy:  wealthy actors or
early insiders hold outsized power , which can lead to a social contract that is less egalitarian than hoped.
In some prominent DAOs, a handful of wallets can sway any vote – analogous to having oligarchs in a
nation-state. This undermines the legitimacy  of those DAOs in the eyes of smaller participants; they may
feel disenfranchised, seeing it as a feudal token system rather than a democratic one. Recognizing this,
many  communities  are  discussing  or  implementing  measures  to  broaden  participation:  from  user
verification (proof-of-human or soulbound tokens)  to prevent one person masquerading as many, to
quadratic  voting  to  favor  broad  consensus,  to  delegation  with  accountable  delegates  to  combine
expertise  with  representation .  These  experiments  mirror  political  science  debates  –  essentially,
DAOs are testing digital forms of direct democracy, representative democracy, liquid democracy, etc., trying
to find what yields both efficiency and fairness. The social contract within each DAO is often codified in a
constitution or manifesto  that sets the values (e.g., “one token one vote” or “commitment to transparency”
or community goals). The process of creating and amending these is itself a new kind of social contract
formation: it’s usually open to all members to propose changes and requires supermajority votes to alter
core rules, akin to amending a constitution but at rapid startup speed.
In terms of  agency , DAOs give individuals the freedom to organize economically and socially without
needing legal charter or corporate overhead – you can spin up a DAO with strangers around the world to
fundraise for a cause (like ConstitutionDAO did to bid on a copy of the U.S. Constitution) or to build an open-
source  project.  This  is  collective  agency  unleashed  by  technology:  people  coordinate  trustlessly  with
escrowed funds and enforceable rules, achieving feats (raising tens of millions in days, for example) that
previously required trust in established institutions. It lowers the barrier to collective action. That can shift
power  away  from  traditional  centralized  entities  (companies,  governments)  if,  say,  people  choose  a
community-run alternative. One could imagine in the future even local governments or co-ops being run as
DAOs for transparency – indeed some city experiments (like “CityDAO” in Wyoming, which bought land as a
DAO) hint at that. There’s also exit rights  in DAOs – many DAOs allow members to exit with their share of
assets (“rage quit” in Moloch DAO design) if they disagree with a decision. This concept, borrowed from
Albert O. Hirschman’s “exit vs voice” idea, means the social contract in a DAO might be upheld not just by
loyalty and voice (voting), but also by the freedom to leave without loss. That potentially keeps power in
check: leaders (if any) know that if they go against the community’s interest, members can fork or exit,
draining the project of resources. This is a dynamic less available in nations (where leaving is hard) or
corporations (where you may lose your job or share value if you dissent).
The broader societal impact of DAOs ties into legitimacy and law. As DAOs become more prevalent, people
might  start  expecting  real-world  governance  to  also  be  more  transparent  and  participatory .  For
example,  someone  active  in  a  well-run  DAO  might  wonder ,  “why  can’t  my  city  budget  use  a  similar
participatory process?” It’s telling that some local governments have even tried quadratic voting/funding for
budgeting (Colorado did a pilot with quadratic funding for grants). In this way, DAOs are  incubators for
governance  innovation  that  could  trickle  out  to  the  non-crypto  world  if  successful.  They  press  on
questions of legitimacy : does a vote on-chain by anonymous token holders carry moral weight? Perhaps
yes, if those token holders are the ones affected and invested in the outcome (like stakeholders). But what
about the stakeholders who have no tokens? This is analogous to shareholders vs stakeholders debates in
corporate governance, now in hyper-speed. If a DeFi platform’s DAO votes to change interest rates, it affects
users who may not all have governance tokens. So, the social contract in these ecosystems can struggle
with representation – an area for improvement. 6181
14
Wyoming’s granting of legal status to DAOs is a recognition that they can be legitimate entities representing
a collective will . It’s a case of law catching up to on-ground social contracts: people acted as if their
DAO was an organization, and now the law is saying “okay, we will treat it as one, under these conditions.”
This integration strengthens the  agency and power  of DAOs in society – they can buy property, hire
employees, enter contracts. At the same time, it  imposes accountability  (a DAO can be sued, whereas
before  it  was  nebulous  who  to  sue).  That  is  a  maturation  of  the  social  contract:  rights  come  with
responsibilities. DAO members get limited liability (a perk from society’s legal system) in exchange for some
transparency  and  compliance  (e.g.,  filing  public  registration).  This  is  akin  to  how  the  corporate  social
contract works, now extended to decentralized orgs.
In summary, DAOs are redefining how people coordinate resources and authority. The best of them show
that  distributed  governance  can  be  effective  and  align  incentives  –  e.g.,  community-run  protocols
managing billions in cryptoassets without centralized oversight, guided by the collective decisions of users.
They highlight values of  transparency, inclusiveness, and merit-based contribution , which can make
organizational governance feel more  legitimate to participants  than a distant shareholder-elected board.
However ,  they  also  reveal  pitfalls  like  plutocracy,  voter  apathy,  and  security  risks,  reminding  us  that
technology alone doesn’t guarantee fairness – the rules and culture matter . The evolving social contract
around DAOs seems to be one that prizes voluntary association  (you choose to join/leave a DAO by buying
or selling tokens),  open participation  (anyone with interest can get involved, at least in theory), and
algorithmic trust  (trust in code rather than in bosses). As these concepts prove themselves (or fail) in
practice, they may influence broader expectations of governance in our societies, pushing us toward either
more direct participation or cautioning where decentralization has limits. Either way, DAOs have already
shifted the conversation about who can hold power and how we collectively decide on the rules that bind
us.
Digital Education and Credentialing
Blockchain Credentials and Digital Diplomas (MIT’s Blockcerts and Beyond)
Educational and professional credentials – diplomas, certificates, licenses – are vital to how modern society
allocates opportunities, yet the current system for managing them is often slow, siloed, and fraud-prone.
Digital credentialing initiatives seek to modernize this by issuing tamper-proof, verifiable credentials  that
individuals can hold and share. One notable project is Blockcerts , an open standard co-developed by MIT.
In 2017, MIT piloted issuing digital diplomas  to graduates using the Bitcoin blockchain . Technically,
the MIT Blockcerts system worked as follows: Each student received a digital diploma file (essentially a JSON
document) signed by MIT. A cryptographic  hash  of that diploma was recorded on the blockchain (in this
case, Bitcoin’s, via a transaction) as a permanent timestamp . The student stores their diploma in a
smartphone wallet app (the Blockcerts Wallet). If they need to prove their degree to an employer , they can
simply send the digital file; the employer , using a Blockcerts verifier , checks that the file’s hash matches
what’s on the blockchain and that the signature is MIT’s. Because any alteration to the diploma would
change the hash, and because MIT’s public key is known, this verification proves that “MIT issued this
diploma to this person and it has not been altered” . The  beauty of the design  is that it doesn’t
require MIT or any intermediary to confirm the credential each time – the  graduate has autonomy  to
present it, and anyone in the world can independently verify it in seconds using the blockchain record. MIT
described it as giving students “ ownership of their records ” in a permanent way . The blockchain
acts as a decentralized trust anchor  ensuring longevity (even if MIT or the vendor goes away, the record
still exists on Bitcoin’s ledger) .8272

Since  that  pilot,  the  concept  has  spread.  Countries  like  Malta  conducted  nationwide  pilots  to  put  all
educational  certificates  on  blockchain,  using  Blockcerts  for  secondary  school  and  vocational  training
credentials . The goal was to ease verification for employers and cross-border recognition (Malta’s
small, many students go abroad, so having a trusted digital credential helps). Likewise, many universities
and MOOC providers have experimented with issuing  verifiable digital certificates  – some on public
chains like Ethereum, others on private ledgers or simply using digital signature frameworks (like signing a
PDF with a cert). Another relevant standard is the  W3C Verifiable Credentials (VC)  data model, which
generalizes what Blockcerts did: any issuer can issue a signed credential (not necessarily on a blockchain,
but can be anchored to one), and the holder can present it to a verifier who checks the signature and
optional ledger entry. For instance, the European EBSI pilot we mentioned in identity is doing  digital
diplomas across universities  using VCs anchored on a blockchain, so an employer in one EU country can
trust a diploma from another’s university without lengthy bureaucratic checks. There are also platforms like
Learning Machine (now Hyland Credentials)  and BCdiploma  that offer blockchain credential services to
institutions, and open source efforts for “Open Badges” (which started as a non-blockchain digital badge
standard by Mozilla, now converging with W3C VC). So, the tech is fairly mature: it usually involves a public-
private key infrastructure where institutions sign credentials and optionally a blockchain or distributed
ledger to timestamp or register those credentials for extra security and discovery.
Policy  integration  is  gradually  happening.  Some  governments  have  begun  to  legally  recognize  digital
credentials.  For  example,  in  2018,  Malaysia  reportedly  recognized  blockchain  certificates  from  some
universities  as  valid.  Georgia  (the  country) ,  beyond  land  titles,  also  worked  on  verifying  education
credentials using similar tech for public sector hiring. A major barrier to adoption is not technical but
institutional inertia and standards . Verifiers (employers, licensing boards) need to be onboard with new
verification  processes.  However ,  we’re  seeing  movement:  the  Bologna  Digital  Credentials  initiative  in
Europe is aligning blockchain credential projects with the existing frameworks for degree recognition. Also,
during COVID-19, digital credentials got a boost out of necessity – some universities issued e-diplomas
when  graduations  went  remote.  Another  angle  is  professional  licenses  and  continuing  education  –
putting those on blockchain can help prevent fraud (like fake medical licenses) and ease portability (if you
move states or countries). Governments are interested because it can reduce credential fraud (a huge
problem in some regions where fake degrees are common) and administrative overhead. Yet, policy must
ensure privacy (a student might not want their credentials on a public ledger without control). Blockcerts
handled this by not putting any personal data on-chain, only hashes . The user shares the actual
data off-chain. This is a privacy-friendly approach aligning with data protection laws.
Social contract analysis:  Digital credentialing changes the power and trust relationships in education and
hiring. Traditionally, institutions held all the cards  – you often have to request transcripts or verification
letters, and you trust institutions (and sometimes intermediaries like background check companies) to
certify your accomplishments. This can be time-consuming and exclude the individual from the loop (e.g.,
an employer writes to a university, the student isn’t involved). With systems like Blockcerts, the  agency
shifts to the individual : you directly hold your proof of achievement and can decide when and with whom
to share it. This empowerment is analogous to self-sovereign identity – your diplomas become part of your
personal  portfolio  that  you  control.  It  reduces  dependency  on  institutional  gatekeeping  for  routine
verification. That can particularly help in cases where institutions shut down or records are lost – e.g.,
refugees or migrants could carry their verifiable credentials even if the issuing school no longer exists or
can’t be contacted internationally. It contributes to equity  by leveling the field: smaller institutions or those
in developing countries can issue globally verifiable credentials just like top universities can, increasing the
legitimacy of those credentials abroad and the opportunities for graduates. It also deters fraud: from the9091
8685
16
employer’s side, they now have a tool to instantly catch fake certificates (the hash won’t match anything on
the blockchain if someone fabricates a diploma). So the  transparency and integrity  of qualifications in
society improve. This might build a more meritocratic social contract: jobs and positions can truly be given
based on credentials that are verified, not just who can afford fancy credential evaluation or who can fake a
document.
For the social contract between learners, institutions, and employers, these technologies add a layer of
trustworthiness  and potentially change expectations. If my diploma is digital and verifiable, perhaps I can
also assert partial credentials (like specific skills or courses) in a trusted way. This leads to the idea of micro-
credentials  and lifelong learning: individuals might accumulate many certified skills from various providers
(not just one alma mater), and present relevant ones for a job. The new social contract here is more
granular – not just “I trust you have a degree” but “I trust you have these specific competencies, because
each is verified.” That could democratize hiring by focusing on skills over pedigree, if done right, thereby
promoting fairness. It also could reduce the time and cost involved in credentialing processes, making it
easier for people to move and apply their qualifications elsewhere (a win for labor mobility and personal
growth).
There are potential downsides or at least new considerations. Privacy : while Blockcerts-type designs hide
details on-chain, if not carefully implemented, digital credentials could inadvertently leak data. For example,
an employer could require a verification that effectively tells them “this person graduated in the bottom half
of their class” if the system isn’t careful (imagine if more info than necessary is revealed). The  power
dynamic between employers and applicants  could shift – employers might demand to see your whole
wallet  of  credentials  (like  seeing  all  your  badges,  not  just  the  degree  you  offer),  possibly  pressuring
candidates to expose more than they’d like. Society will have to set norms (perhaps legal ones) on what’s
appropriate, much as we did with credit reports or social media in hiring.
Another effect on the social contract is longevity and legitimacy  of credentials. A paper diploma can be
lost or destroyed, but a blockchain credential in theory lives forever online. Does that mean society will
expect you to prove a 20-year-old degree more often? Or could help with long-term verification (no more
skepticism “did you really graduate? yes, here’s the proof even if the university archive burned down”).
Legitimacy of institutions  might also become more transparent: a diploma mill can’t easily fake being
accredited if the verifying networks only honor signatures from recognized institutions. Over time, one
could see emergent reputation scores for issuers (like, credentials from University X are verified and widely
accepted, whereas some shady issuer’s credentials are not present on the trusted ledger or are flagged).
This could push the education ecosystem toward quality and accountability.
From a policy standpoint, if governments endorse blockchain credentials, they are basically enshrining that
individuals have the right to their own achievement data  in a usable form. This aligns with broader data
portability  rights  (like  in  GDPR).  It  shifts  the  social  contract  in  education  from  “the  university  as  the
custodian  of  your  achievements”  to  “you  as  the  custodian,  with  the  university  as  the  certifier .”
Psychologically, that’s empowering – it treats the learner as the owner of their learning outcomes. It’s a
more client-centric view of education. 
In  summary,  digital  and  verifiable  credentialing  technologies  enhance  transparency,  trust,  and
individual agency  in the realm of qualifications, which is a key part of societal structure (jobs, status, etc.).
By securing credentials with cryptography and decentralization, they make the verification process more
legitimate and efficient  – a truth claim like “Alice has a PhD” no longer relies solely on institutional prestige
17
or bureaucratic letters, but on a verifiable fact. This can strengthen the social contract by reducing the
friction and suspicion in credential-based interactions. People can trust each other’s qualifications more
readily, and individuals can trust that their hard-earned credentials won’t be doubted or held hostage by
gatekeepers.  It’s  a  move  toward  a  more  transparent  meritocracy ,  though  care  must  be  taken  to
implement these systems in ways that respect privacy and don’t inadvertently create new inequalities (like a
divide  between  those  who  have  digital  credentials  and  those  who  don’t  –  hopefully  mitigated  by  the
proliferation of the technology itself). Overall, this is a case where technology can fortify the social contract’s
fairness  element:  rewarding  merit,  enabling  trust,  and  giving  individuals  rightful  ownership  of  their
achievements.
Data Unions and Collective Data Ownership
Data Unions: Monetizing and Governing Personal Data Collectively
In today’s digital economy, personal data (web browsing habits, purchase history, location trails, etc.) is
mostly harvested by big companies, often without much benefit to the individuals who produce it.  Data
unions  are an emerging model that flips this script: they enable individuals to pool their data and share in
the value  created by it, typically by bargaining collectively with data buyers. Technically, data unions are
facilitated by platforms that gather streams of user data with consent, anonymize or aggregate it, and then
allow external entities to query or purchase insights from the combined data set . An example is Swash , a
browser extension that lets users contribute their browsing history data to a common pool . Users
can toggle certain sites or data types off to protect sensitive info, but otherwise their data flows into the
pool in real-time. The data union (built on the Streamr platform) then sells access to this large anonymized
browsing dataset – buyers might be marketing firms, researchers, or others seeking web usage patterns
. Revenue from the sale is automatically shared among the contributors  (often via crypto tokens
or micropayments) and a portion goes to the maintainers of the union (for running the service) . Under
the  hood,  smart  contract-based  solutions  like  Streamr’s  Monetization  stack  (Monoplasma)  handle
splitting payments among potentially thousands of participants efficiently . Another data union,
Reputation  or Data Union DAO , focuses on things like IoT data or personal health data, using a similar
concept: each person contributes small data points that alone aren’t worth much, but together form a
valuable corpus . The crowdselling  of data is thus made convenient and safe (in theory) by these
frameworks.
One  critical  technical  aspect  is  anonymization  and  privacy .  Data  unions  strive  to  protect  individual
identities while still extracting value. This can involve on-device preprocessing (e.g., Swash filtering out
personal identifiers) and ensuring that queries to the data can’t isolate one person. Some use differential
privacy or aggregate statistics so buyers only get trends, not raw personal records. Additionally, many data
unions issue participants a token or credential  proving their membership and sometimes weighting their
share by how much data they contribute or its value. These tokens can also confer governance rights –
hence the “union” analogy: members could vote on policies, such as who can buy the data and at what
price,  akin  to  a  cooperative.  In  practice,  we  are  in  early  days,  and  much  of  the  governance  of  these
platforms is still in the hands of the startup teams or foundations, but the intent is to evolve into more
decentralized governance (hence the term Data Union  DAO in some cases).
From a policy perspective, data unions fit into a nexus of data privacy laws, labor/collective bargaining laws,
and competition policy.  Privacy laws (like GDPR in Europe)  actually encourage empowering users over
their data – GDPR enshrines data portability and consent. Data unions can be seen as a user-friendly way to9293
9495
96
9798
99100
18
exercise those rights: instead of each person individually trying to monetize or manage their data (an
overwhelming task), the union aggregates consents and negotiates deals. Provided they get clear consent
and allow opt-out, they likely comply with GDPR and similar regimes. In fact, regulators have shown interest
in the concept as a means to address the power imbalance in the data economy . The EU’s Data
Governance Act even mentions the idea of data cooperatives . Legally, some data unions might register as
cooperatives  or  companies  owned  by  their  users.  Others  might  remain  informal  DAOs  on  blockchain.
There’s the question: is personal data labor? If so, data unions might be akin to labor unions, raising the
possibility of applying collective bargaining laws – though currently, individuals licensing their data isn’t
categorized as employment, so it’s a novel terrain. Policy might need to adapt to define what rights data
union members have and to ensure they truly benefit (for instance, avoiding exploitation by the union
operators themselves or ensuring fair competition – if one platform dominates, are users locked in? They
shouldn’t be, due to data portability rights).
Data  unions  also  challenge  the  dominant  business  models  of  big  tech.  If  users  en  masse  decide  to
contribute their browsing or shopping data to a union for compensation, and perhaps even  withhold it
from Big Tech unless paid , that shifts power . Companies like Facebook/Google rely on free data; a data
union world could force a more  equitable value distribution  or at least transparency. We might see
pushback or co-option – e.g., big companies might try to quash these efforts or conversely buy data from
data unions (implicitly paying users) rather than gather it all themselves under scrutiny. Already, we see
proposals for “data dividends” in places like California (inspired by Jaron Lanier and others) which are
philosophically aligned with data unions: the notion that if your data is being sold, you should get a cut.
Social contract analysis:  Data unions represent an attempt to renegotiate the modern social contract
around personal data. Presently, the implicit contract has been: users give away data for free (or for use of a
service),  and  companies  monetize  it  with  little  accountability.  This  has  led  to  huge  power  and  wealth
asymmetries (big tech giants) and concerns about surveillance and manipulation, with individuals having
scant control. The data union model proposes a new bargain: individuals collectively reclaim agency over
data , treating it as an economic resource they have rights to. In doing so, they gain  both  a voice and a
reward in how data is used. This is empowering: one person alone cannot do much with their data (and
selling it themselves would yield pennies and raise privacy risks), but a million people together can demand
a fair price and set terms (e.g., “we only sell to research beneficial to society, not to spammy advertisers,” if
they so choose). It’s a shift from being exploited subjects to active market participants  or even data co-
owners. This adds a measure of equity  to the digital economy: people who generate value get to see some
of that value back. It could mitigate the trend of all value accumulating to platform owners, thus addressing
inequality at least marginally.
Another  important  aspect  is  transparency  and  consent .  In  a  data  union,  there’s  ideally  a  clear
understanding  of  what  data  is  collected  and  who  buys  it  (the  union  can  inform  members,  since
members have governance or at least a dashboard). This contrasts with the opaque tracking today where
users rarely know which third parties trade their data behind the scenes. By making data transactions
collective and above-board, it  restores some honesty to the social contract : people know what they’re
part of and can exit if they dislike it. As the Streamr example pointed out, “it is up to the individual to decide
which Data Unions can sell their information, emphasizing privacy, transparency, and user control, where there
was little to none before” . That pretty much encapsulates the new contract: user control first.
Moreover , data unions encourage thinking of personal data as  labor or property  that one can organize
around. This could have far-reaching social implications. If people feel they are contributing productive100 101
102
19
asset (data) and being compensated, they may feel less alienated by technology. It could improve trust in
the digital ecosystem – instead of a sense that “the system is spying on me,” participants feel “I’m knowingly
contributing my data for agreed uses and getting fair compensation.” That said, some critique whether this
truly empowers or just commodifies privacy. If people start depending on data union income, could that
incentivize them to allow more intrusion into their lives for money? There’s a balance: the union structure is
meant to advocate for members’ best interests, not just maximize data extraction, so presumably they’d set
ethical  boundaries.  But  if  someone  is  desperate  for  income,  they  might  join  many  data  unions  and
overshare, potentially risking privacy for money. Society might need to consider safety nets or standards so
that monetizing data remains a choice, not a necessity that erodes privacy for the vulnerable (just like labor
laws prevent exploitation of labor).
In terms of power relations , data unions somewhat level the playing field between individuals and large
data consumers (corporations, AI firms, etc.). Individually, our data power is negligible; collectively, it’s
significant. A data union can negotiate prices or demand certain usage restrictions that an individual never
could. This collective bargaining can infuse more  democratic control  into data markets. For example, a
data union might vote not to sell to an entity known for unethical behavior , thus exerting moral agency.
That’s a shift: currently individuals have basically no say in how their data is used once it’s out; a union can
impose community values on data usage. This is reminiscent of how labor unions didn’t just get higher
wages but also improved working conditions by collective action – data unions could push for privacy-
respecting practices as a condition of sale, improving conditions in the digital environment.
Another interesting angle is the  concept of a data commons  – data unions could ultimately facilitate
pooling data for public good too. Not all data use is about ads; it could be about medical research. One can
imagine health data unions where patients share health telemetry in a pool for pharma research and get
compensated or get access to insights/treatments discovered. The social contract in that case becomes
almost civic: citizens contributing to a commons with safeguards and fair return. This collective approach
might increase willingness to share data for beneficial purposes (like fighting a pandemic) because trust is
higher when people feel in control and part of the decision loop.
In summary, data unions aim to inject agency, fairness, and collective governance  into the personal data
arena,  thereby  rewriting  the  digital  social  contract  that  has  so  far  been  very  one-sided.  They  treat
individuals not as passive data sources but as stakeholders who can unite to claim property rights or
bargaining rights over their digital selves. If widely adopted, this could diminish the unchecked power of
data  monopolies  and  lead  to  a  more  balanced  and  transparent  digital  economy ,  where  consent  is
informed and value distribution more just. However , success requires that data unions themselves stay true
to their promise – they must be trustworthy intermediaries (likely with oversight or open-source code or
DAO structures to ensure they don’t become new exploiters). In essence, data unions have the potential to
empower  individuals  and  communities,  align  data  practices  with  democratic  values ,  and  grant
legitimacy to the idea that  our data is ours , to be used on our terms for mutual benefit, rather than
something surreptitiously taken and used without accountability .
Conclusion:  Across these diverse domains – currency, identity, property, governance, education, and data –
a common theme emerges: digital technologies are enabling  new forms of trust, participation, and control
that can fundamentally reshape the  social contract . Blockchain and related innovations provide tools to
redistribute power (from central authorities to networks or individuals), enhance transparency (through
immutable  public  records),  and  encode  fairness  and  consent  into  systems  (via  smart  contracts  and99100
20
decentralized governance). Each technology comes with its unique balance of benefits and challenges, and
none is a panacea on its own. But together , they point toward a future where  agency is more evenly
distributed : citizens can have more say in how money works, how identity is managed, how communities
govern themselves, how public goods are funded, and how personal data is used. This is essentially about
legitimacy  in the digital age – systems that are seen as legitimate are those that are accountable, inclusive,
and align with societal values like equity and freedom. By integrating technical design with enlightened
policy  (such  as  Wyoming’s  DAO  law  or  the  EU’s  identity  framework),  we  see  a  path  to  digital  public
infrastructure  that is not just efficient, but also respects and elevates the role of the individual and the
community. 
The new social contract being forged is one where code and law work hand in hand : code to enforce rules
transparently and impartially, and law to ensure those rules were chosen through a legitimate, human-
centric process. Whether it’s a self-sovereign ID that gives a refugee access to services, a DAO that lets a
cooperative of artists make decisions without a manager , or a central bank digital currency that directly
empowers citizens financially, these innovations reimagine classic social contract questions – Who decides?
Who benefits? Who is accountable? – in light of technological possibility. The answer increasingly can be: we
decide, we benefit, and we are accountable , as a collective of peers, not just through top-down hierarchy.
Achieving this requires vigilance (to avoid new forms of concentration or exclusion) and experimentation (as
we are learning what works in real time). But the projects surveyed here demonstrate that around the
world,  from  small  nations  to  global  networks,  the  momentum  is  toward  digitally  transforming
governance and social relations  in a way that could make them more open, fair , and resilient. Each pilot –
be it Estonia’s e-state or Ethereum’s platform or Gitcoin’s quadratic funding – offers lessons and building
blocks for this broader evolution. The ultimate success will be measured by how much these technologies
enhance human dignity, trust, and collective prosperity . If they continue on their current trajectory with
thoughtful integration of policy and ethics, we may well witness a historic renewal of the social contract,
one that is fit for the digital era .
