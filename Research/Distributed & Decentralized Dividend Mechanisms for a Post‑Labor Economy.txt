Distributed & Decentralized Dividend Mechanisms
for a Post‑Labor Economy
Introduction
Automation and artificial intelligence are transforming the economic landscape, potentially reducing the
need for human labor on a massive scale. In a “post-labor” economy where traditional jobs are scarce, new
models of broadly distributing  capital and common wealth  are gaining attention. These models aim to
give every person an economic stake and income stream  independent of wages , thereby supporting
economic  agency  even  as  labor  earnings  decline.  This  report  synthesizes  leading  proposals  and
implementations  –  in  the  U.S.  and  select  international  cases  –  for  distributed,  decentralized,  and
collective property/dividend mechanisms  that could provide widespread income in a post-labor United
States. We examine each model’s structure, current status, and potential payout, then compare them across
key dimensions. An ambitious but plausible combination scenario  is presented, estimating the total per-
capita income that such mechanisms could deliver , both in nominal terms and adjusted for possible cost-of-
living reductions from automation-driven deflation.
National, State, and Municipal Wealth Funds
Social  Wealth  Funds  (National):  A  national  sovereign  or  “social”  wealth  fund  is  a  publicly  owned
investment  fund  that  accumulates  diversified  assets  (stocks,  bonds,  real  estate,  etc.)  on  behalf  of  the
citizens and pays out dividends to everyone. The U.S. has no federal social wealth fund yet, but proposals
exist to create one. For example, the American Solidarity Fund  proposed by economists would have the
federal  government  gradually  acquire  a  broad  portfolio  of  assets  and  pay  an  annual  universal  basic
dividend  (UBD)  to  all  Americans .  The  concept  draws  inspiration  from  existing  funds  abroad:
Norway’s oil-based sovereign fund has amassed public assets worth 271% of GDP, enough that its 2017
investment returns alone (if distributed) would equal $25,500 per Norwegian . A U.S. fund on that scale
(roughly  $54 trillion  in assets) could likewise pay each American several thousand dollars per year from
investment income . While that is exceptionally ambitious, even a smaller U.S. social wealth fund
would meaningfully broaden capital ownership. One analysis suggests that a well-funded U.S. social wealth
fund could eventually pay on the order of $6,000+ per year per adult  from earnings . Such a fund
remains proposed (not yet implemented)  at the national level, making its viability uncertain in the near
term. However , it has precedent: public investment funds exist in dozens of countries and U.S. states.
State Sovereign Wealth Funds:  At the subnational level,  state-run wealth funds  invest state revenues
(often from natural resources) to benefit the public. The most famous example is the Alaska Permanent
Fund (APF) , funded by oil royalties. Since 1982, the APF has paid all Alaska residents an annual Permanent
Fund Dividend (PFD)  drawn from the fund’s investment earnings. The dividend varies with market returns –
for example, in 2017 each Alaskan received about $1,100 , and in prior years it reached as high as $2,072 per
person  (over $8,000 for a family of four) . This direct cash distribution of common resource wealth has
made Alaska one of the most economically equal states  and enjoys broad public support. Other U.S.
states have smaller funds (often dedicated to education or budgets rather than personal dividends), but12

none besides Alaska currently pays residents a cash social dividend . Establishing new state wealth funds or
expanding  them  to  pay  citizens  is  possible  (especially  in  resource-rich  states),  but  political  and  fiscal
constraints make widespread adoption  uncertain . Still, Alaska’s success demonstrates high  viability  in
principle for state-level funds: the APF’s structure has withstood decades of political changes and economic
cycles. Typical payouts range around $1,000–$1,500 per person yearly  under moderate oil price scenarios
.  Ambitious  scenarios  (e.g.  multiple  states  adopting  Alaska-like  funds  or  Alaska’s  fund  growth
accelerating) could yield ~$2,000+ per resident annually. In most states, though, any future dividends would
likely be more modest unless substantial new revenue sources are dedicated.
Municipal Wealth Funds and Urban Asset Corporations:  Cities and municipalities are also experimenting
with collective ownership of assets to fund public needs. One model is the urban wealth fund , a city-owned
development  corporation  that  manages  municipal  assets  (land,  real  estate,  infrastructure)  for  public
benefit. A notable example is  Copenhagen City & Port Development  in Denmark – a publicly owned
corporation that took control of Copenhagen’s harbor and former industrial land. By leasing and selling this
land  for  redevelopment,  City  &  Port  generated  massive  revenues  which  it  reinvested  in  public
infrastructure  (famously  financing  Copenhagen’s  metro  system) .  This  self-sustaining  model  turned
underutilized  public  assets  into  an  engine  for  urban  regeneration  without  burdening  taxpayers .
Essentially, the city created a wealth fund at the municipal level: profits from rising land values and rents are
captured by the public entity and plowed back into community investments (transit, affordable housing,
public spaces) rather than accruing to private landowners. While Copenhagen’s model does not pay direct
cash dividends  to individual residents, it effectively delivers a  collective dividend  in the form of new
infrastructure and services funded by shared assets . A similar approach could be applied in U.S. cities with
significant  public  land  or  enterprise  assets  (e.g.  port  authorities,  utilities,  redevelopment  land  banks).
Indeed, researchers have highlighted untapped public wealth  in American cities that could be managed
more strategically . A few U.S. cities are exploring this concept, but it remains nascent . The legal/
institutional framework for municipal wealth funds in the U.S. is  immature  – most city assets are not
consolidated into a single fund, and governance would be a challenge.  Viability  is medium-term: with
political will, cities could pilot asset corporations or trust funds, but the model may need adaptation to local
context.  If  successfully  implemented,  the  per-capita  benefit  would  likely  come  indirectly  (better
infrastructure or city services rather than a check). For instance, a city wealth fund might finance a transit
project or affordable housing instead of raising taxes , effectively saving each resident money (a “dividend
in-kind” ). In an ambitious scenario (major cities leveraging public land value), such funds could conceivably
offset on the order of $1,000+ per resident per year  in public costs, though direct cash payouts by cities
are unlikely in the near future.
Private and Participatory Capital Models (ESOPs, Co-ops, Trusts)
Not  all  broad-based  ownership  models  are  run  by  government  –  many  operate  at  the  enterprise  or
community  level  to  spread  capital  among  workers,  consumers,  or  stakeholders.  These  participatory
capital models  include employee stock ownership plans, cooperatives, and profit-sharing trusts. They are
decentralized  by  nature  (implemented  firm  by  firm  or  community  by  community)  but  can  collectively
contribute to a more equitable, post-labor economy by giving people ownership stakes and income from
capital.
Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs):  An ESOP is a program in which a company’s employees
collectively own stock in the company, usually via a trust. In the U.S., ESOPs are an established
mechanism (enabled by federal law since 1974) to broaden corporate ownership. Today over 6,3007

companies have ESOPs , covering more than  10 million American workers . These plans
hold about  $1.8 trillion  in assets for employees – an average of  $180,000 in wealth per ESOP
employee  (often  in  the  form  of  retirement  account  value).  Research  shows  that  ESOP
participants benefit from higher wealth and comparable or higher pay  relative to similar workers
at  traditional  firms .  For  example,  one  study  found  employee-owners  have  over  twice  the
average retirement savings  of non-owners ( ~$170k vs $80k on average) . By giving workers a
share of capital income (through profit distributions or stock appreciation), ESOPs can supplement
or  enhance  wages  –  effectively  providing  a  private  dividend  tied  to  company  performance.
However , these benefits currently reach only a fraction of the workforce (~6–10% of U.S. employees).
If employee ownership expanded, the impact on wealth inequality could be huge: even moving to
10% employee-owned  nationally would more than  double the wealth of the bottom 50% of
households  in  America .  Under  a  very  broad  ESOP  scenario  (e.g.  30%  employee-owned
economy),  median  wealth  of  disadvantaged  groups  would  multiply  severalfold .  ESOPs  are
legally mature and proven  (thousands exist), with high viability  for gradual expansion – policies
like tax incentives and loan programs already support ESOP formation. In a post-labor future, ESOPs
could ensure workers retain a share in the productivity of automated firms.  Per-capita payout:
ESOPs don’t provide a universal payment to all citizens; rather , they yield benefits to participating
employees (often as a lump-sum retirement distribution or periodic profit-sharing). An average ESOP
employee might receive the equivalent of a  5–15% boost to annual pay  in profit shares or stock
accrual, depending on the company’s profits. In concrete terms, that could be several thousand
dollars per year in extra compensation, accumulating to six-figure ownership over time . But for
the typical U.S. resident (many of whom are not ESOP participants), the current  population-wide
average  dividend  from  ESOPs  is  effectively  nil.  Thus,  ESOPs  can  be  a  powerful  tool  for  those
included, but their aggregate impact depends on how widely they spread.
Worker Cooperatives:  A worker cooperative is a business owned and democratically governed by
its employees , with each worker typically having one voting share. Like ESOPs, worker co-ops give
labor a direct ownership stake, but co-ops usually start as employee-owned from the outset (or
convert through purchase) and emphasize democratic control (one member , one vote). The U.S. has
on the order of 500–1,000 worker co-ops  in operation, but most are small; total co-op employment
is only ~7–8,000 workers according to recent counts . While currently a tiny niche  in the U.S.
economy, worker co-ops have a strong track record in other countries (for instance, the Mondragon
Cooperative Corporation in Spain employs ~80,000 worker-owners). Studies find that worker co-ops
can  deliver  higher  wages,  more  job  stability,  and  greater  worker  satisfaction  compared  to
conventional firms . Importantly, co-ops share profits among the worker-owners, often in the
form of annual patronage dividends or bonuses based on each member’s labor contribution. This
means that as automation increases overall productivity, co-op members can collectively decide to
reduce hours or redistribute surplus as income, rather than lay off workers – a potential model for
shared prosperity with less work . The viability  of scaling worker co-ops in the U.S. is moderate:
legal structures exist and interest is rising (especially among younger entrepreneurs and in sectors
like  home  care,  retail,  and  manufacturing),  but  co-ops  face  barriers  in  accessing  capital  and
supportive policy. If significantly expanded, worker co-ops could ensure that a broad swath of the
labor force directly benefits from capital income . However , like ESOPs, their payouts are limited
to members . A thriving co-op sector might routinely provide each worker-member an annual profit
dividend of say 5–25% of their salary  (varying widely by enterprise economics). This could translate
to a few thousand dollars per worker per year in a modest scenario, up to tens of thousands in1213

highly profitable co-ops. For the general populace, though,  co-op dividends are not universal  –
they strengthen worker-owners’ incomes rather than paying everyone.
Consumer  and  Platform  Cooperatives:  Not  only  workers,  but  consumers  and  users  can  also
collectively  own  enterprises.  Consumer  cooperatives  (like  credit  unions,  mutual  insurance
companies, or member-owned retail co-ops) distribute earnings to their customer-members, usually
proportional to patronage. For example, credit unions often return profits as lower loan rates or
occasional patronage dividends to their millions of depositors. These member dividends tend to be
modest (e.g. a credit union member might get a year-end rebate of ~$50 or better interest rates
worth a few hundred dollars), but they represent another decentralized way of sharing economic
surpluses . Platform cooperatives  apply similar principles in the digital economy – envision an Uber
or Facebook owned by its drivers or users, who then receive a portion of the platform’s profits. This
idea is largely aspirational so far , but some pilots exist (for instance, a driver-owned ride-hailing coop
in New York). If gig workers or internet users collectively owned the platforms they power , they could
capture income that now flows to corporate shareholders. For instance, a platform co-op social
network might pay each user a small dividend from ad revenues, effectively a “data dividend.” While
today  platform  co-ops  remain  experimental ,  they  are  seen  as  a  viable  future  model  to
democratize the wealth generated by AI and networks. The payouts  in consumer/platform co-ops
are typically proportional to use  (spending, contributions, etc.), and in many cases are delivered via
better prices rather than cash. In aggregate, expanded consumer co-ops could return some value to
a majority of Americans (since many people use co-ops like credit unions, grocery co-ops, rural
electric co-ops, etc.), but these returns are relatively small on a per-capita basis – perhaps tens to a
few hundred dollars a year  in savings or patronage for an active member . Platform co-ops, if they
captured major market share, could in theory pay out more significant sums (imagine if a user-
owned YouTube paid popular content contributors a dividend, or if a ride-share co-op returned
profits to drivers). However , because these are voluntary, market-based structures , their ability to
provide a  universal income floor  is limited. They are best seen as part of a pluralistic approach:
empowering individuals as workers and consumers to capture more of the value they create.
Profit-Sharing  Trusts  and  Inclusive  Ownership:  A  profit-sharing  trust  is  a  broad  term  for
arrangements where a company’s profits (or shares) are partly held in a trust for the benefit of
employees, stakeholders, or the public. One example is the John Lewis Partnership  in the UK – a
major retailer (John Lewis department stores and Waitrose supermarkets) that is 100% owned by an
employee  trust.  Each  year ,  all  80,000+  employees  receive  a  profit-sharing  bonus  (historically
around 10–15% of their annual pay in good years) as “partners” in the firm. This model has sustained
over decades, showing that large enterprises can be run for workers’ benefit at scale. Another
example was proposed in the UK as “Inclusive Ownership Funds” (IOFs) : a policy idea (advanced by
the Labour Party in 2018) to require large companies to gradually transfer a small percentage of
shares into a fund owned by employees. The fund would pay annual dividends to the workers
(capped at ~£500 per worker , with any excess potentially going to a public fund for social dividends).
While the IOF policy was not implemented, it echoed earlier experiments like Sweden’s Meidner
funds (discussed below) in seeking to socialize ownership incrementally . Profit-sharing trusts can
also be designed to benefit communities – for instance, a local business could place some equity in a
community trust that pays dividends to community projects or residents. These models are  semi-
private : they rely on corporate governance or legislation rather than voluntary market action alone,
yet they operate within individual companies or sectors. Their  legal maturity  varies – employee
trusts  are  well-established  (especially  in  the  UK  and  other  Commonwealth  countries),  whereas•

mandated inclusive ownership policies are still just proposals  in most places. Viability  is medium:
profit-sharing within companies is common (many firms have bonus pools or stock grants), but
formalizing a share of profits for workers by right requires stronger policy support or cultural buy-in.
In terms of  payouts , profit-sharing trusts can be significant for those included – e.g. John Lewis
employees enjoyed substantial bonuses (in peak years, a month’s extra pay). If an American inclusive
ownership mandate had been enacted, one analysis estimated workers would get a few thousand
dollars each in annual dividends , and some of the fund’s gains would accrue to the public .
However ,  like  other  enterprise-level  solutions,  these  payouts  do  not  reach  people  outside  the
participating  firms.  Thus,  while  profit-sharing  and  trust  ownership  improve  equity  within
workplaces , additional mechanisms are needed to support those without  such affiliations (e.g. the
unemployed, caregivers, etc.) in a post-labor scenario.
Voluntary Community Equity Vehicles (Community Investment
Trusts)
Not  all  collective  wealth-building  is  done  via  employers  or  governments  –  there  are  also  voluntary,
community-based  investment  models  that  allow  individuals  to  buy  into  local  assets  and  share  the
returns. One innovative example is the Community Investment Trust (CIT)  model pioneered in Portland,
Oregon. The CIT is a community-owned real estate investment vehicle  designed for low- to moderate-
income residents. It enables neighbors to purchase small ownership shares (as little as $10/month)  in a
local commercial property (in Portland’s case, a shopping center in their community) . The trust is
structured to protect against loss and to provide accessible entry for people who have never owned assets
before. Investors receive  annual dividends  from the property’s rental income and can also benefit from
property value appreciation . In the East Portland CIT’s first few years, over 160 families became co-
owners; the project delivered dividends averaging  ~9% annually  and the share price of their investment
nearly doubled (from $10 to $15.86) in about three years . Residents thus saw both ongoing income and
capital gains, helping them build wealth collectively in their neighborhood. The CIT also reported positive
social effects (increased civic engagement and financial literacy among participants) . 
The CIT model demonstrates a path for community members to voluntarily pool funds and buy assets
that would otherwise be out of reach individually. By doing so, they transform from renters or consumers
into  owners  of  local  capital ,  capturing  value  that  might  have  flowed  to  outside  investors.  While  the
Portland CIT is relatively small, its success has led to interest from over 60 cities in 23 states  looking to
replicate the approach . The concept is  operationally distinct  from public wealth funds or ESOPs: it
relies on individual contributions (not taxes or company benefits) and is open to any resident in the target
community. In terms of  maturity , CITs are in early pilot stages – Portland’s is a proof of concept, and
replications are just beginning. The regulatory framework (securities law, etc.) needed adjustments to allow
unaccredited small investors to participate, which the CIT team navigated through creative legal structuring
. Viability  appears reasonably good on a small scale (especially with nonprofit or municipal backing
to initiate projects), but scaling up will require community organizing and identifying suitable properties
and financing. 
For participants, a CIT can provide a modest but meaningful  dividend income : in Portland, the dividend
was around  $30–$50 per share annually  (9% of a $10 share, in early years), and many investors held
multiple shares (though capped to keep the focus on broad inclusion). Someone investing $50 a month
could after a few years be earning a few hundred dollars a year in dividends – not a full livelihood, but a23

helpful supplement and a source of equity. Per-capita impact:  Because CITs are voluntary and localized,
the average American isn’t receiving anything from them unless they choose to invest. In an  ambitious
scenario , if CITs or similar community ownership funds proliferated in many cities, millions of people could
become small stakeholders in local real estate or businesses. Their annual returns might range from a few
dozen to a few hundred dollars per person  (depending on investment size and project success). More
importantly,  these  vehicles  would  broaden  asset  ownership  and  could  be  especially  empowering  for
historically  marginalized  communities  to  build  wealth  from  the  ground  up.  Still,  CITs  alone  are  not  a
solution for universal income – they are a  complementary strategy  to let willing individuals invest in
collective assets with relatively low risk and low buy-in thresholds.
Compulsory Equity Dilution Funds (Wage-Earner Funds & Universal
Basic Dividend)
A more radical set of proposals for broadly sharing wealth involves mandating that private corporations
systematically distribute equity to workers or the public . Instead of relying on voluntary participation
(as in ESOPs or CITs), these mechanisms use laws or formulas to dilute traditional ownership over time ,
transferring a portion of corporate wealth to collective funds. Two prominent concepts in this category are
wage-earner funds  (a worker-oriented model originating in Sweden) and the  universal basic dividend
(UBD)  or public equity share idea (as championed by figures like economist Yanis Varoufakis).
Meidner-Style Wage-Earner Funds:  In the 1970s, Swedish economists Rudolf Meidner and Gösta
Rehn, backed by the Swedish trade unions (LO), proposed establishing collective  “wage-earner
funds”  to gradually socialize ownership of companies. The Meidner Plan called for a form of “scrip
tax” on corporate profits: each year , companies above a certain size would have to issue new shares
equal to a percentage of profits and contribute them to regional union-controlled funds . Over
time, these funds (owned on behalf of the workers) would accumulate an increasing stake in firms.
Meidner calculated that with a modest profit-based share issuance (around 20% of profits) and
reinvestment of dividends, the funds could achieve majority ownership of Swedish corporations
within ~25 years . In practice, a watered-down version was implemented in Sweden in the 1980s:
instead of share issuance, a special excess-profits tax was levied and the proceeds used by wage-
earner funds to buy stocks on the market. Though the program was politically controversial and later
abolished, by 1991 the funds had managed to  acquire about 7% of the outstanding shares of
Swedish companies . This was far short of the original plan, but still a significant collective
holding before the experiment ended. The Meidner model is notable as a compulsory mechanism
to broaden worker ownership  economy-wide, rather than firm-by-firm voluntary adoption. If a
similar wage-earner fund were adopted in the U.S., it could incrementally shift a portion of corporate
equity (and thus future profits) to either employee funds or potentially to all workers nationally. Such
a policy is currently only theoretical in the U.S.  (no active proposals in Congress) and would face
strong political resistance, making its near-term  viability low . However , the idea has influenced
other proposals (like the UK’s IOF mentioned earlier). Legal maturity  is low (it would require new
legislation), though Sweden’s experience provides a precedent.  Potential payout:  A fully realized
wage-earner fund would eventually give workers collective claims on profits. In Sweden, had the
funds reached majority ownership, workers could effectively control dividend distributions – possibly
resulting in additional income per worker on the order of thousands of dollars yearly (depending on
company profits). In a partial implementation (say funds end up owning 10–20% of companies),
annual dividends to the fund could be a smaller percent of total profits. Those could be distributed•

equally among workers or used for worker benefits. It’s hard to estimate U.S. per-capita numbers, as
it depends on design: if, hypothetically, 10% of U.S. corporate equity was transferred to a worker
fund yielding, say, a 3% dividend, and that was split among all workers, it might provide on the order
of $1,000 per worker annually . Under a more aggressive plan (as Meidner imagined), it could be
several  times  that  (essentially,  workers  eventually  replacing  capitalists  as  recipients  of  most
corporate  dividends).  But  again,  unlike  a  universal  fund,  this  would  exclude  those  not  in  the
workforce, and it has yet to gain traction in U.S. policy.
Universal Basic Dividend (Public Equity Share):  A closely related concept shifts the focus from
workers to all citizens . The idea, sometimes called a Universal Basic Dividend (UBD) , is to require
companies to contribute a portion of their ownership to a public wealth fund  that pays dividends to
everyone. Yanis Varoufakis, for example, has argued that instead of taxing automation or robots,
governments should legislate that large corporations issue new shares and deposit them into a
public trust on an ongoing basis . This could be structured, for instance, as: every year , each
publicly traded company must transfer shares equal to (say) 1–2% of its market value into a national
“citizens’  fund.”  Over  time,  the  public  fund  would  own  an  expanding  slice  of  corporate  equity,
entitling it to a corresponding slice of all dividends paid. Those dividends would then be distributed
equally  to  all  citizens  as  a  social  dividend  (hence  “basic  dividend”).  Crucially,  this  financing
mechanism does not rely on taxation  – it directly allocates a portion of capital to the public as new
wealth is created. The rationale is that society at large (through public infrastructure, educated
workforces, data contributions, etc.) helps create corporate profits, so society should get a direct cut
of those profits . Varoufakis specifically highlights Big Tech companies whose value is built on
user data and publicly-funded technology; he suggests a UBD funded by share issuance as a way for
people  to  benefit  from  tech-driven  productivity  gains .  A  similar  idea  was  independently
proposed by others – for example, economist Glen Weyl and lawyer Eric Posner once suggested an
“IPO tax” where a percentage of shares from every initial public offering go into a sovereign fund
. In the U.S., the closest historical analogue is perhaps the SEC’s small stock issuance fee  (used
to fund its operations), but using equity transfers to fund a universal social dividend would be a
novel  step.  Maturity:  This  concept  is  at  the  proposal  stage  globally;  no  country  has  fully
implemented a UBD via equity dilution, though it is being discussed in futurist and basic income
circles.  Viability:  Politically,  it  faces  resistance  similar  to  a  wealth  tax  or  heavy  regulation  of
corporations, but it might garner support as an alternative to general taxation for funding a basic
income. If automation dramatically displaces jobs, a UBD of this sort may gain appeal as a way to
directly tie everyone’s income to the economy’s capital growth.  Potential payout:  If, over some
decades, the public fund amassed a substantial equity stake, the dividends could be sizeable. For a
rough sense, consider U.S. corporate profits and dividends: U.S. nonfinancial corporate profits are on
the order of trillions per year; even a 5–10% public claim on that could yield hundreds of billions
annually for distribution. One analysis in  The Week  imagined a social wealth fund (built by various
means)  large  enough  to  pay  $6,400  per  year  to  every  American  adult .  A  UBD  via  share
issuance could potentially reach a similar magnitude in the long run. In a conservative scenario, it
might start small – e.g. a few hundred dollars per person after some years. A moderate scenario
might see it climb into the low thousands per year . An ambitious scenario  (decades of accumulating
equity)  could  rival  a  full  basic  income,  perhaps  $5,000+  per  capita  annually  funded  purely  by
dividends. Importantly, this would be  universal  – everyone from the unemployed to retirees to
workers would get the dividend, reflecting their stake in the nation’s productive capital. The UBD
model is essentially a way to institutionalize a share of capital income for all . It aligns with the• 
36

23

idea of treating common inputs (like data, public research, social stability) as deserving a return.
While still speculative, it is a powerful vision for a post-labor economy.
Automation  Capital  Funds:  A  variant  on  the  UBD  theme  focuses  specifically  on  financing  via
automation-related gains. As automation replaces labor , one proposal is to create  “automation
investment funds”  or require an “automation contribution” from firms. For instance, some have
suggested that if a company saves money by installing robots (thus cutting jobs), it should either pay
a tax or issue equity equivalent to a portion of those savings into a public fund. This is conceptually
similar  to  Varoufakis’s  idea,  but  justified  directly  as  capturing  the  “robot  dividend”  for  society.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates famously floated the idea of a “robot tax”  on companies that automate
away jobs, with the revenue used to fund human services. Varoufakis countered that a robot tax is
unwieldy , and a better approach is the equity-based UBD . The end goal is the same: ensure
that as capital (robots, AI) replaces labor , the returns to that capital are partly socialized  to provide
income for those left out of work. Some thinkers also propose an “AI dividend”  – if AI algorithms
rely on data from the public, then any wealth generated should be shared back. These automation-
focused funds would essentially operate like a specialized sovereign wealth fund (accumulating
assets or fees from AI/robotics-heavy firms). Maturity:  Pure automation funds are still just an idea;
none exists at scale. Viability:  Medium-to-low in the short term; it requires policymakers to accept
the premise and either mandate share transfers (politically challenging) or impose targeted taxes
(also challenging). However , as AI/automation impacts grow, there may be increasing openness to
such schemes. Payouts:  If, for example, every large tech firm had to gradually give 1–2% of equity to
a public fund, within a decade the fund could own a noticeable stake. Automation-intensive sectors
(tech, manufacturing, logistics) could feed the fund. The eventual payout would overlap with the
UBD discussed above – essentially, this is one method to finance a universal dividend. So one can
expect similar figures: modest at first, potentially scaling to a few thousand dollars per person per
year if pursued assertively. The key difference is framing – it ties the dividend to automation’s
impact, reinforcing the social contract that the benefits of automation are shared .
Rent Capture and Commons Dividends (Land, Environment, Data)
Another suite of models for providing broad-based income focuses on capturing rents from non-labor
sources – things like land, natural resources, carbon emissions, the electromagnetic spectrum, and even
personal data. These are areas where either the commons  or the finite nature  of a resource suggests that
private actors should pay society for use, and those revenues can be redistributed as dividends . Many of
these ideas draw from the notion of a  “citizen’s dividend”  – a payment to all citizens from commonly
owned assets or rights.
Land Value Tax and Land Dividends:  Land (especially urban land) is a classic example of a scarce
resource  whose  value  is  created  by  nature  and  the  community  (location,  public  infrastructure,
economic development) rather than the landowner’s efforts. Land value taxation (LVT)  – taxing the
unimproved value of land – has long been advocated by economists from Henry George to Milton
Friedman as an efficient and fair tax. One appealing use of land tax revenue is to fund a universal
dividend .  Since  the  value  of  land  is  effectively  generated  by  society,  taxing  that  value  and
redistributing it aligns with the idea that every citizen should benefit from the commons. How much
money could this yield? Studies indicate that a full  100% tax on land rents  in the U.S. (in theory
capturing  all  surplus  land  value)  could  fund  a  very  substantial  basic  income.  A  recent  analysis
estimated that a national LVT at an aggressive level  could raise enough revenue to pay every adult•

American roughly $5,750 per year  as a universal dividend. Even a partial land value tax (or
using only part of the revenue for dividends) could provide a meaningful stipend. For instance, one
model found that in the UK, a much smaller LVT (1% of land value) could finance a modest universal
payment of about £64 per month, significantly reducing poverty . In the U.S. context, urban land
values are enormous – by capturing them for public benefit, we could both improve efficiency
(reducing speculation) and fund social dividends.  Maturity:  Land value tax is well-understood in
economic theory and has been implemented in limited ways (some cities have LVT or split-rate
property taxes). However , no jurisdiction in the U.S. currently redistributes LVT revenue as a direct
dividend.  It’s  usually  used  for  public  budgets.  Viability:  Politically,  LVT  faces  opposition  from
landowners, but it has cross-ideological support among economists as “the least bad tax.” If framed
as funding tax relief or dividends for all, it could gain traction. Some U.S. cities (e.g. Pittsburgh
historically) have tried split-rate taxes with success, and places like Taiwan and Singapore effectively
capture land value via public land ownership or leases. If a significant LVT were implemented at city,
state, or federal level, using at least part of it for a citizen dividend  is very viable (Alaska’s oil fund is
analogous but for oil land). Under a conservative scenario  (small land tax), the dividend might be a
few  hundred  dollars  per  person.  A  moderate  scenario  (more  robust  land  tax  or  in  high-value
regions) could yield a couple thousand per person. The  ambitious scenario  (the earlier $5,750
figure) would require a truly sweeping policy shift but illustrates the scale: on the order of several
thousand  dollars  annually  per  citizen  from  land  wealth .  Aside  from  cash  dividends,
capturing  land  rents  could  also  fund  public  goods  or  reduce  other  taxes,  indirectly  benefiting
everyone.
Resource and Carbon Dividends:  The concept of sharing natural resource wealth  with citizens is
already reality in some cases – the Alaska Permanent Fund dividend, as discussed, is essentially a
carbon resource dividend  funded by oil revenues. The idea can be extended to other environmental
commons. A leading proposal is the Carbon Fee-and-Dividend : impose a fee on carbon emissions
(upstream on coal, oil, gas) and  redistribute 100% of the revenue equally to citizens . This is
designed to combat climate change while ensuring the policy is financially progressive (households
that use less carbon come out ahead). Bills such as the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend
Act have been introduced in Congress and garnered dozens of sponsors . Though not yet
law,  similar  carbon  rebate  schemes  exist  elsewhere  (e.g.  Canadian  provinces  return  carbon  tax
revenue as checks to residents). Payout:  How much money are we talking about? It depends on the
carbon price. The bipartisan Climate Leadership Council  plan, for example, envisioned a carbon fee
starting around $40/ton. They estimated this would yield about $2,000 per year for a family of four
in dividend revenue  – i.e. roughly $500 per person  at the outset. As the fee rises over time (to
spur deeper emissions cuts), the dividend would also grow. Analyses by climate policy researchers
find that a $100/ton carbon price (which is considered a strong but not implausible level by 2030 or
so) would generate on the order of $1,500 per person annually  in the U.S. . Even at more
moderate prices (say $50–$60/ton), we could see perhaps $700–$900 per person  per year . Notably,
carbon dividends are typically framed as  per adult or per household  rather than truly per-capita
including children, but many proposals include a half-share for children. Maturity:  The idea is fairly
mature – legislation has been crafted, and the policy is well-studied . Canada, Switzerland,
and some other jurisdictions are already doing forms of carbon dividends .  Viability:  There is
significant political debate, but a carbon dividend has bipartisan appeal (it’s revenue-neutral and
returns money to citizens). It could realistically be implemented in the medium term if climate
consensus improves. Carbon dividends won’t replace a full income, but in combination with other
dividends, $500–$1,000+ a year per person  is a meaningful piece.3839

Spectrum and Digital Dividends:  The electromagnetic spectrum used for telecommunications (TV,
radio, mobile networks) is a public resource that governments often lease out to companies via
auctions. The U.S. federal government has raised tens of billions of dollars from spectrum auctions
(for instance, 5G spectrum auctions in recent years netted over $80 billion). Currently, those funds
usually go into the Treasury or specific programs. The spectrum commons  could be another source
of dividend payments – essentially treating spectrum like a national asset that all citizens should
benefit from. One could imagine a Spectrum Dividend , where auction revenues (or annual license
fees) are placed in a trust and distributed to the public. If, for example, $20 billion per year were
available from spectrum fees, that would be about $60 per person annually . That’s not huge, but it’s
not nothing – and as wireless usage grows, it could increase. Some economists have suggested more
regular charging for spectrum usage (since current licenses often last decades) and recycling that
money to citizens .  Maturity:  The mechanism (auctions) exists, but using it for dividends
would be new. Viability:  Relatively low politically, as spectrum funds are seen as general revenue,
but in principle it’s straightforward.  Data Dividends:  A more novel idea is that individuals should
receive compensation for the personal data they generate, which tech companies monetize. This is
often phrased as  “data is the new oil”  and thus perhaps should yield a dividend like oil does in
Alaska. California’s Governor in 2019 proposed exploring a “ Data Dividend ” so that tech firms “share
the  wealth”  with  users .  The  idea  could  take  forms  like:  companies  paying  users
micropayments  for  data,  or  a  state  imposing  a  tax  on  tech  firms’  data-driven  revenue  and
redistributing it. So far , no concrete large-scale data dividend has been implemented. One challenge
is determining the value of an individual’s data (which varies greatly) . Another approach is to
create a public data trust : e.g., require big digital platforms to contribute a percentage of profits (or
equity, akin to UBD) to a fund that pays out to citizens. Viability:  It’s an emerging idea – politically
there is interest (as seen in California’s discussions, and Andrew Yang’s advocacy for a data dividend
during his presidential run), but it’s complex to execute. The sums at stake: tech companies do make
enormous profits (the top five made over $200 billion in profit in 2021), but divided by all users, it
might only be a few dollars per user per month unless a significant cut is shared. One estimate
suggested if Facebook shared even 30% of its ad revenue with users, it could be on the order of
$100–$200 per year per user  (rough ballpark). So a data dividend might provide  tens to a few
hundred dollars per person annually  in the ambitious case. It’s more likely to be a supplemental
income stream rather than a primary one.  Legal maturity:  still just proposals and pilot ideas; no
statutory data dividend exists yet in the U.S.
Environmental and IP Royalties:  Other scarce inputs could generate smaller citizen dividends. For
example, a Carbon Cap-and-Trade auction  (like in California’s climate program) generates revenue
that could be rebated – similar to a carbon tax dividend. Some proposals also consider dividends
from pollution permit auctions  or congestion pricing fees , though those would be relatively small
per capita and often earmarked for specific uses. Intellectual property (IP)  is another area: much of
the foundational research behind new technologies and drugs is publicly funded. One could imagine
a system where when publicly funded IP is commercialized, a portion of royalties or equity returns to
a public innovation fund that pays dividends (or is reinvested in research). For instance, the NIH
funding that leads to a breakthrough drug could entitle the public to a small royalty on sales,
distributed as health dividends or used to reduce drug prices. These ideas are less fleshed out, but
align with the concept of a  “social inheritance”  – society’s cumulative knowledge and innovation
yielding a return for all. •

In  sum,  rent-capture  dividends  are  diverse,  but  together  they  tap  into  the  value  of  commons  and
externalities  – land, environment, spectrum, data – and ensure that value is shared rather than solely
privatized. Many of these mechanisms (land tax, carbon fee) have the dual benefit of improving market
outcomes  (reducing speculation or pollution) while raising revenue. Each alone might provide a modest
dividend; combined, they could add a few to several thousand dollars per person per year in income or
equivalent benefits.
Capital Endowment Accounts (Baby Bonds and Universal
Inheritance)
Lastly, beyond ongoing dividends, another strategy for empowering individuals in a post-labor economy is
to grant people capital assets at key life stages  (typically at birth or reaching adulthood). Instead of (or in
addition to) giving everyone a small stream of income yearly, this approach gives each person a one-time
endowment  – essentially seed capital or a trust fund that they can use to generate income or invest in their
future.
“Baby  Bonds”  (Child  Trust  Accounts):  The  term  “baby  bonds”  refers  to  publicly  funded  trust
accounts established for children when they are born, which grow over time and can be accessed
when the child reaches adulthood. This idea has been championed in the U.S. by scholars like Darrick
Hamilton and was introduced as legislation by Senator Cory Booker and Congresswoman Ayanna
Pressley (American Opportunity Accounts Act). Under Booker’s federal proposal,  every newborn
would  receive  a  federal  trust  account  with  a  $1,000  initial  deposit ,  and  each  year  the
government would contribute additional funds on a sliding scale based on the family’s income (low-
income kids get more, high-income kids get little or none) . The funds would be invested (for
example, in safe government bonds) until the child turns 18. At 18, the young adult could use the
accumulated funds for approved asset-building purposes like college tuition, buying a home, or
starting  a  business .  The  goal  is  to  ensure  that  every  person,  especially  those  from
disadvantaged backgrounds, enters adulthood with some capital nest egg , narrowing the racial and
wealth gaps that compound over generations. Research indicates this policy would dramatically
reduce the racial wealth divide – one study found median wealth for young Black adults would rise
from $0 (for many) to tens of thousands of dollars with robust baby bonds . Maturity:  The
baby bonds idea is proposed  at the federal level, not enacted, but it has gained significant attention
and some funding in state and local pilots. For instance, the District of Columbia launched a baby
bonds  program  in  2021,  and  states  like  Connecticut  and  Washington  have  approved  versions
targeting children in low-income families (though at smaller scales than Booker’s plan). The UK
actually implemented a form of child trust fund in the 2000s (giving every baby ~£250 at birth, plus
another £250 at age 7), but that program was later discontinued. Viability:  Politically, baby bonds
have  moderate  viability  –  they  directly  address  inequality  and  have  a  relatively  clear  funding
mechanism (Booker’s plan suggested paying for it by higher estate and capital gains taxes ). The
cost is not trivial (around $60 billion per year for Booker’s plan ), but not outlandish relative to
federal budgets. It essentially transforms part of wealth redistribution into a delayed benefit for the
next generation.  Payout:  Baby bonds are not an annual income, but rather a  one-time capital
grant . Under the Booker proposal, the poorest children would accumulate up to $46,000 by age 18
(in 2019 dollars) while even children from higher-income families might have a smaller account
around $1,700 . The average account was estimated around  $20,000 at age 18 . To put
that  in  perspective,  $20k  could  be  invested  to  yield  perhaps  $800  a  year  in  perpetuity  (at  4%•

interest), or used to significantly offset college costs or a mortgage down payment. In an ambitious
scenario (if contributions were larger or invested in higher-return assets), these accounts could be
even bigger – some advocates imagine every young adult receiving, say, $50k or $100k  of capital to
start adult life. Baby bonds thus provide economic agency at the life stage when individuals are
making key education and career decisions . They don’t directly pay a stipend to live on year-to-
year , but they equip the next generation with wealth that can generate income or improve life
outcomes, which is crucial in a post-labor context (where owning assets may matter more than
earning wages).
Social Inheritance or Universal Capital Grants:  A related idea is to give everyone a capital grant at
the start of adulthood funded by the  taxed inheritance or wealth of the older generation  –
effectively a “universal inheritance.” This echoes Thomas Paine’s 18th-century proposal (in Agrarian
Justice ) to give all 21-year-olds a certain sum, financed by a tax on land/property of the deceased. In
modern form, economists like Anthony Atkinson and Thomas Piketty have suggested that every
young adult could receive a substantial  stake  from the state. Piketty, for example, has floated an
inheritance for all of around €120,000 (roughly 60% of average wealth) at age 25, financed by
progressive wealth and inheritance taxes . In the U.S., legal scholars Ackerman and Alstott in
1999 proposed a “Stakeholder Society” grant of ~$80,000 for every citizen at age 21, paid for by an
annual wealth tax. The purpose is to even out the largely unearned advantage that those with
wealthy parents have, and to give everyone a fair start in an economy where capital is essential.
Maturity:  These grand-scale proposals are  theoretical  at this point – no country gives six-figure
sums to all young adults. However , elements can be seen in smaller policies (e.g., some countries
exempt a certain amount of inheritance tax for education accounts, etc.). Viability:  As a standalone
idea, it’s politically challenging – such a program would require large wealth transfers and would be
labeled radical in many contexts. But it addresses a core issue of intergenerational equity in a time
when capital does much of the work. If technological unemployment becomes severe, there could be
greater public openness to heavier wealth redistribution in order to give everyone a stake. Payout:
By design, a universal inheritance is a one-time payout  rather than ongoing income. The numbers
often discussed are $50,000 to $100,000 (or more)  per person at adulthood (which could be, say, a
inheritance-like grant from society). If prudently invested, $100k could provide a modest income
stream (e.g., in a conservative portfolio yielding ~3-4%, that’s ~$3–4k/year in income). Or it could be
used to buy a home (avoiding rent costs, effectively increasing disposable income) or to start a
business (creating one’s own job in a post-labor economy). So while not a “dividend” in the annual
sense, a universal capital grant can significantly enhance lifetime economic security. One could view
it as each citizen getting a share of society’s capital at the outset , which they then manage. In a
scenario where automation is generating great wealth for the owners of capital, ensuring every
citizen has capital ownership (even if small) helps democratize those gains .
It’s worth noting that  capital endowment policies  like baby bonds or universal inheritance have effects
that unfold over generations. They may not immediately provide income to today’s middle-aged workers or
retirees, but they fundamentally change the wealth distribution for the next generation, preparing for a
future where passive capital income might be a primary source of livelihood. In combination with the
annual dividends from wealth funds and rents, these endowments can ensure each person not only has
some baseline income but also a cushion of assets  to weather economic changes.•

Table  1:  Comparison  of  Distributed  Ownership/Dividend  Models. Note:  “Per-capita  payout”  is
approximate  and  assumes  full  implementation  of  each  model;  many  are  not  additive  for  the  same
population (e.g. an individual might benefit from multiple mechanisms).
Aggregate Potential Income in a Combined Scenario
If several of the above mechanisms were implemented together at ambitious levels, what  total income
floor  could  Americans  expect  in  a  post-labor  economy?  It’s  instructive  to  sum  the  approximate
contributions of different models under a plausible high-end scenario :
National Social Wealth Fund : ~$5,000 per person annually (assuming a large fund paying a UBD,
on par with a mid-century target from proposals) . 
Land Value Dividend : ~$5,000 per adult (full land rent utilization could provide ~$5.7k/adult ;
perhaps somewhat less if not 100%). 
Carbon Dividend : ~$1,000 per person (if carbon fees ramp up to meaningful levels, e.g. ~$75/ton
CO2). 6263
• 
6
• 41
• 
17
Other Rent/Commons Dividends  (spectrum, data, etc.): ~$300 per person combined (e.g. spectrum
$50, data $100+, other resource dividends like modest mining royalties, etc.). 
State/Local Dividends : ~$500 per person average (if some states add resource dividends and cities
offset costs via wealth funds – highly variable; Alaska residents would get more, others less). 
Work-Based Distributions  (ESOPs/co-ops/worker funds): These would bolster those who are
employed or participating, but for a universal income  perspective we focus on the above
universalizable streams. (However , it’s worth noting that widespread worker ownership could raise
the earned incomes of many by a significant margin, reducing pressure on the purely passive
income side.)
Adding these up, an ambitious yet plausible package  could deliver on the order of $12,000–$15,000 per
person per year  in the mid-to-long term (roughly by 2025 dollars). For context, this is in the ballpark of
poverty-line income for a single individual in the U.S. and would represent a dramatic shift from the status
quo. It’s essentially a baseline living income funded by capital and commons, rather than wages.
To be clear , this figure isn’t certain – it assumes robust political action to enact multiple programs, and the
high end of what those programs might sustainably pay. For example, $15k per person would require
trillions  in  collective  assets  and  revenue:  roughly,  a  combination  of  Norway-scale  public  wealth
accumulation, significant land and carbon rents, and other dividends. Yet none of it is outright utopian:
Alaska’s fund + a serious carbon fee + a land dividend alone could approach half that amount , and
adding a national fund and other sources could feasibly reach or exceed the lower end of that range in a
rich economy. For instance, one estimate finds that just a social wealth fund and carbon dividend together
might yield around $7k–$8k per adult at maturity , and land value capture could double that .
Purchasing Power Considerations:  Crucially, in a heavily automated economy, the cost of goods and
services might significantly decrease due to efficiency gains. If AI and automation lead to, say, a 30–40%
reduction in the real prices  of many essentials (energy, manufactured goods, basic services), then the
same dividend income would stretch much further . A combined dividend of $15,000 in nominal 2025 dollars
could have the effective purchasing power of ~$21,000–$25,000  in today’s terms if prices fell 30–40%. In
other words, even if people’s money income is somewhat modest, their real standard of living  could be
closer to what $20k+ buys today, because automation makes everything cheaper . This kind of deflationary
effect  has  historical  precedent  in  specific  sectors  (think  of  how  computing  power  got  exponentially
cheaper); if it spreads economy-wide, it boosts the impact of any universal income. Therefore, the effective
income floor  under the ambitious scenario might be roughly equivalent to the median disposable income
of a lower-middle class lifestyle today – enough to cover basic needs and then some, especially when
combined with free or cheap public services that could be funded alongside (healthcare, education, etc.,
which many proposals also envision).
It’s important to note that these figures are illustrative estimates . The actual outcomes would depend on
policy details, economic growth, and distribution choices. Nonetheless, this exercise shows that a multi-
pronged approach – national wealth sharing + common resource dividends + labor-centric ownership
reforms + capital grants  – could realistically support a scenario where a large portion of the population’s
livelihood comes from non-labor income . People would still be free to work (and earn more) if jobs are
available, but the floor of economic security  would be higher and decoupled from traditional employment.
In a best-case post-labor economy, an American might receive a national dividend check, a carbon dividend,
perhaps a state dividend, payouts from cooperative memberships, and have a nest-egg from a baby bond –
together providing both  steady income and capital stake . And as automation drives productivity and
lowers costs, those shared gains ensure everyone benefits, not just a few owners of technology.•

Conclusion
Preparing for a post-labor future calls for rethinking how income and wealth are distributed. The models
covered in this report offer a toolkit of solutions  to shift from an economy where wages are the primary
source  of  livelihood  to  one  where  citizens  share  in  ownership  of  wealth  and  common  resources .
National and local wealth funds can socialize a portion of capital returns; cooperatives and ESOPs can
democratize private enterprise; rent-based dividends can monetize our common wealth for public benefit;
and  endowment  accounts  can  give  each  new  generation  a  tangible  stake.  These  strategies  are  not
mutually exclusive  – in fact, they are complementary and can reinforce each other . For example, robust
public dividends could work in tandem with employee ownership: citizens get a baseline income, while
those  who  work  in  cooperative  firms  get  additional  shares  of  the  surplus,  all  contributing  to  broad
prosperity .
Policy  and  academic  circles  are  increasingly  exploring  these  ideas  not  as  fringe  experiments,  but  as
necessary adaptations to technological and social trends. Many of the models have real-world precedents
(from Alaska to Mondragon to Copenhagen), proving their basic feasibility. The challenge ahead is largely
political: building the coalitions and public understanding to implement and scale these mechanisms in the
U.S. context. Issues of governance, financing, and equity will need careful design – for instance, ensuring
funds are managed transparently and payouts are distributed fairly. But the upside is clear: a society where
the fruits of capital and innovation belong to everyone , providing material freedom and security even as
formal jobs become less central. 
In conclusion, while no single model is a silver bullet, a  diversified portfolio of distributed ownership
policies  could collectively furnish a sustainable economic floor in a post-labor America. By learning from
both domestic experiments and international examples, U.S. policymakers can craft a distinctly American
approach  to  common  wealth  distribution  –  one  that  preserves  entrepreneurial  dynamism  and
decentralization (through private co-ops and trusts) while also embracing bold public mechanisms (like
social wealth funds and dividends) to guarantee that no one is left without an income as work changes .
Such a transformation would fulfill, in modern form, a long-held vision: that technological progress and
shared ownership of resources enable greater liberty, equality, and abundance for all.
