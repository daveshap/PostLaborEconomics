Decentralized and Productive: DAOs Building Real- World Value by 2025 Introduction: From Hype to Economic Substance In the mid-2010s, the notion of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) was a futuristic curiosity. Early experiments were tumultuous – most infamously “The DAO” of 2016, which raised $150 million only to collapse via a hack. But fast forward to mid-2025, and DAOs have matured into a thriving ecosystem of organizations that deliver tangible products, services, and infrastructure . No longer merely crypto casinos or self-referential token schemes, many DAOs today resemble digitally-native cooperatives or startups with real revenue, real users, and real teams . They are building stablecoins that power global commerce, exchanges processing billions in trades, networks storing and transmitting data, and communities funding everything from software to scientific research. All of this is happening under novel governance models where token-holders collectively steer the ship. This report provides a narrative, nonfiction-style exploration of these functional and economically productive DAOs. We begin with a macro-level survey of the DAO ecosystem as of mid-2025 – its scale, sectors, and milestones – then dive into case studies of several successful projects that epitomize how decentralized governance can produce real-world value. Along the way, we examine how different jurisdictions around the globe are responding to the rise of blockchain-native organizations. From Wyoming to Switzerland to China, lawmakers and regulators are grappling with the implications of decentralized ownership . The goal is to understand where and how this phenomenon is taking concrete root economically and legally. The DAO Ecosystem in 2025: Scale and Scope Not long ago, DAOs were niche experiments; today they are a significant force in the Web3 landscape. By early 2024, over 50,000 DAOs exist, collectively involving more than 11 million governance token holders . This is a staggering increase from just a few dozen DAOs in the late 2010s. For example, only 10 active DAOs existed in 2019 , but by mid-2022 Snapshot , a popular voting platform, had recorded activity in over 6,000 DAOs . In other words, the number of active DAOs has grown by tens of thousands of percent in just a few years . While many of these organizations are small or experimental, the top-tier DAOs now control massive financial resources and user communities . Financial Scale: As of 2024, DAOs were collectively managing over $30 billion in assets in their treasuries . These treasuries often consist of a mix of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and other assets controlled by on-chain governance. Importantly, the wealth is concentrated: the top 5 DAOs hold over 60% of all DAO treasury assets . Powerhouses like Uniswap, Arbitrum, and MakerDAO alone account for a large share of the $30B+ in DAO treasuries . For example, Uniswap’s DAO treasury exceeds $3 billion in value , giving it the resources of a mid-sized corporation. Arbitrum – an Ethereum scaling network – and MakerDAO – the issuer of the DAI stablecoin – also each steward substantial treasuries in the high hundreds1 23 4 5 6 7 8 1 of millions or more. This concentration suggests that a handful of very successful protocols have amassed war chests to fund ongoing development and ecosystem growth. Yet smaller DAOs are numerous and collectively nontrivial. Importantly, these figures show that DAOs have become “financial engines,” not just experiments . Managing a treasury of even a few million dollars requires rigor . Accordingly, leading DAOs have adopted practices akin to traditional finance: multi-signature wallets for fund security, elected financial committees, external audits, and transparent reporting to members . The major difference is that these controls and reports are on-chain and transparent , viewable by the entire community rather than behind boardroom doors. Participation and Governance Activity: Sheer membership in DAO communities is in the millions, but active participation is a smaller subset. Roughly 3.3 million people have been active voters or proposal- makers in DAOs . This indicates that about one in three governance token holders participates in on- chain governance. In fact, the participation rate per proposal tends to average 15–25% of token holders voting – which may sound low at first glance, but is actually higher engagement than most traditional public company shareholder votes (which often see single-digit turnout). In 2023 alone, over 12,000 governance proposals were created across DAOs , ranging from protocol upgrades and budget allocations to community initiatives. This flurry of proposals shows that DAOs are not passive holding vehicles – they are active communities deliberating and making decisions. The pace is intense: on average, over 1,000 proposals per month were up for vote across the ecosystem in 2023, underscoring how governance is a constant, ongoing process in decentralized organizations . Managing this volume of decision-making has required tooling and coordination mechanisms. Many DAOs use off-chain voting tools like Snapshot (which hosts over 80% of all DAO votes) , combined with on- chain execution via multisigs or governance contracts. The use of gasless off-chain voting on Snapshot allows broader participation (no transaction fees to vote) and flexibility in voting schemes (weighted voting, quadratic voting, etc.) . We also see DAOs innovating with delegated voting (appointing delegates or representatives) to address voter apathy, and experimenting with incentives like POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol badges) for participation . These efforts aim to improve on the 15-25% turnout and ensure that governance isn’t dominated by only a few voices. Diverse Sectors and Purposes: While “DAO” began as a single broad concept, in practice DAOs now span diverse sectors. Early success stories were mostly in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) – protocols for trading, lending, or asset management governed by token holders. Indeed, as of mid-2023 about 40% of all DAOs were related to DeFi , with another 5% being investment or venture DAOs (essentially tokenized venture funds) . This means roughly 45% of DAOs are in the fintech realm broadly defined . But increasingly, DAO innovation has extended into other areas: NFT and Creator Communities: The second-largest category, about 17% of DAOs, focuses on NFTs and creator projects . These include collectives managing NFT art collections, metaverse projects like Decentraland , and communities like Nouns DAO which funds public goods via NFT auctions. Nouns DAO , for instance, has turned daily NFT art sales into a treasury of over 29,000 ETH (around $45M) used to fund creative and charitable ventures – from sponsoring public art to naming a newly discovered frog species after the community. Infrastructure and Web3 Services: About 8% of DAOs are focused on infrastructure projects . These include decentralized networks for storage, bandwidth, computing, and other digital5 910 11 12 13 13 14 15 1617 1819 18 • 2021 2223 • 20 21 2 utilities. We will explore case studies like Filecoin (decentralized storage) and Helium (wireless networking) later in the report. Another example is ENS DAO (Ethereum Name Service) , which provides a decentralized domain name system for crypto addresses. ENS is essentially digital infrastructure – a naming service – governed by its community. Remarkably, ENS has generated over 43,000 ETH in revenue (tens of millions of dollars) from domain registration fees since launching , all of which flows into a DAO-controlled treasury to fund development and ecosystem grants. Social, Gaming, and Community DAOs: The remaining share of the DAO pie includes social clubs, gaming guilds, and community projects. Social DAOs like Friends With Benefits (FWB) or Bankless DAO organize around culture and content (e.g. Bankless DAO produces media and education for crypto enthusiasts). Gaming DAOs manage virtual worlds or in-game assets collectively. For instance, Yield Guild Games is a DAO that invests in play-to-earn game assets and shares revenue with members. These may not have the giant treasuries of DeFi protocols, but they are pioneering new forms of online community ownership. What unites all these sectors is the blockchain-native organizational model: tokenized ownership and democratic governance . Members (often globally distributed) coordinate through forums, Discord chats, and on-chain votes, rather than through traditional corporate hierarchies. Decisions – whether to change an interest rate in a DeFi protocol, fund a new feature in a software product, or sponsor an event in a community – are proposed and voted on by those who hold governance tokens or membership NFTs. The result is a Cambrian explosion of organizational experiments, some thriving, some failing, but collectively demonstrating that decentralized governance can indeed run real services. Economic Productivity and Employment: One critique often levied at DAOs in their early days was that they lacked “real” economic activity – that they were just shuffling tokens. While this may have been true for some, many leading DAOs have proven to be economically productive enterprises . They generate revenue, pay contributors, and build products people use. A look at DAO finances in 2022 found that DAOs paid out over $100 million to contributors for labor that year . In fact, 58% of DAO expenditures went to product development and engineering, and another 22% to growth initiatives – together about 80% of spending on direct value creation . This means the bulk of DAO budgets were spent essentially as R&D and user acquisition outlays, much like a startup reinvesting in building its product and user base. Additionally, over $60 million in grants was disbursed by DAOs in 2022 to fund external projects and teams (often public goods like open-source software) . These figures highlight that DAOs employ real teams – often hundreds of developers, designers, marketers, and community managers across the world earn a living through DAO contributions. For example, MakerDAO has formal “Core Units” (teams) on its payroll for functions like protocol engineering, risk management, and oracles. Uniswap’s DAO funds an independent Uniswap Foundation which in turn gives grants to development teams and community projects. Media reports indicate that MakerDAO processed over $1 billion in treasury transactions in a year , reflecting the volume of salaries, grants and other expenses flowing out to keep its operations running . In summary, by mid-2025 the DAO ecosystem is large, dynamic, and growing more sophisticated . These organizations are no longer just curiosities – some are major economic players in their domains. They collectively manage tens of billions in assets and have demonstrated the ability to coordinate work and capital at scale. However , the degree of success varies widely. To better illustrate what a “functional, economically productive DAO” looks like, we now turn to a few in-depth case studies of standout projects24 25 • 26 2627 28 29 3 across different sectors. Each case exemplifies how decentralized, blockchain-based entities are delivering value in the real world. Case Studies of Successful DAO-Based Organizations MakerDAO: A Decentralized Central Bank Reimagining Finance One of the earliest and most successful DAOs is MakerDAO , often described as a decentralized central bank. MakerDAO governs the Maker Protocol , which issues the DAI stablecoin – a cryptocurrency soft- pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by collateral. Unlike fiat stablecoins run by companies holding reserves in bank accounts, DAI is generated by users who deposit crypto or real-world assets as collateral into smart contracts (Maker “vaults”). The interest paid on these loans (the Stability Fee) and other revenue flows to MakerDAO’s treasury, and decisions on risk parameters, collateral types, and system upgrades are made by MKR token holders via votes . MakerDAO stands out as an economically productive DAO on multiple fronts: Revenue and Profitability: MakerDAO has built a sustainable revenue model from its lending activities. In 2023, Maker’s annualized protocol revenue reached around $200 million , a substantial figure for any financial service . This income comes from interest fees on DAI loans and from yields on assets held. Notably, Maker pioneered bringing Real-World Assets (RWA) into a DeFi protocol – it invested a portion of its stablecoin reserves into real-world instruments like U.S. Treasury bills to earn interest. By late 2023, Maker had over $2.5 billion in tokenized real-world assets (bond ETFs, loans, etc.) on its balance sheet, contributing roughly half of its revenue . This strategy turned MakerDAO into one of the largest decentralized holders of real Treasurys – effectively a community-run investment fund alongside its core lending business. Product-Market Fit: The DAI stablecoin consistently ranks among the top stablecoins in the crypto market, widely used across exchanges and DeFi platforms. At its peak, DAI’s supply approached $10 billion (though it fluctuates; it’s about $5 billion in mid-2025). MakerDAO’s product – a stable, decentralized digital currency – has proven enduringly valuable, especially for users who prioritize censorship-resistance and transparency of collateral. The DAO’s governance ensured DAI remained over-collateralized and solvent even through extreme events like the 2020 crypto market crash (“Black Thursday” ), where Maker famously had to enact emergency measures and then overhauled its risk management to avoid a repeat. These stress tests, navigated through decentralized governance, cemented confidence in the model. Organizational Structure: As Maker grew, it transformed its organization. Initially guided by the Maker Foundation, the project fully dissolved its foundation by 2021, handing control entirely to the DAO. MakerDAO then implemented a Core Unit model – essentially departments or teams (like Risk, Oracles, Engineering, Growth, etc.) that are proposed, budgeted, and overseen through governance. Core Unit facilitators regularly report to the community, and their budgets (often in the millions of DAI per quarter) must be approved by MKR holders. This approach has allowed MakerDAO to function much like a company with departments, but without a traditional CEO or board – token holders allocate resources and can replace core unit teams if needed via votes. It’s a fascinating experiment in community-run corporate structure.3031 • 32 33 • • 4 Profit Sharing and Token Value: One might wonder , with all that revenue, who “profits”? MakerDAO uses some revenue to buy back and burn its governance token MKR, indirectly delivering value to token holders (by reducing supply). It also recently introduced the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) , allowing any DAI holder to lock DAI and earn interest, which is essentially a distribution of some of Maker’s revenue to users. Thus, the surplus generated by the protocol gets recycled into growth and rewarding participants, rather than accruing to traditional shareholders – a different paradigm of value distribution that aligns with the community-owned ethos. MakerDAO’s journey has not been without challenges. Governance is complex and voter apathy can be an issue – turnout for MKR votes varies, and there have been instances of large token holders dominating votes. Recognizing this, Maker has explored delegated voting to empower engaged community members with proxies from quieter holders. Additionally, Maker’s increasing reliance on real-world assets and partners (like banks or trusts holding the collateral for Treasury bill investments) has stirred debates about decentralization versus pragmatism. Founder Rune Christensen’s “Endgame Plan” (an ongoing initiative in 2023–25) proposes further radical changes: splitting MakerDAO into smaller sub-DAOs and redesigning governance to be more gamified and resilient. Whether or not Endgame fully takes shape, it underlines that even a leading DAO must continually evolve its structure to handle growth. In sum, MakerDAO demonstrates that a DAO can perform sophisticated financial functions – creating a stable currency and managing a multi-billion-dollar balance sheet – while remaining broadly decentralized. It earns substantial revenue, funds a global team of contributors, and has carved out a key role in the crypto economy (often being the buyer of last resort for bad debt in DeFi, etc.). Its success lends credence to the idea that community-owned financial services can compete with traditional institutions. As of 2025, MakerDAO is, in effect, a global cooperative bank run on code and voting rather than bankers and boardrooms. Uniswap DAO: Community-Governed Trading Infrastructure If Maker is the bank of DeFi, Uniswap is its stock exchange. Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol that allows users to swap cryptocurrencies without intermediaries, using automated market maker smart contracts. Launched in 2018 by a single developer’s effort, Uniswap exploded in popularity by 2020 as it enabled the trading of countless tokens in a permissionless way. The protocol’s usage grew so large that at times Uniswap v3 (the latest version) has rivaled the trading volume of major centralized exchanges. Uniswap’s journey to becoming a DAO-governed platform is a case study in how a successful Web3 product transitions to community control. Governance and Treasury: In September 2020, Uniswap launched the UNI governance token and airdropped it to tens of thousands of early users – a move that both decentralized the project’s ownership and kickstarted governance. UNI token holders govern the Uniswap Protocol, primarily by voting on parameters, upgrades, and treasury allocations. They were also tasked with managing a substantial treasury: the Uniswap DAO’s treasury holds around $3 billion in various assets, mostly UNI tokens . This treasury was seeded by allocating a significant chunk of UNI’s total supply to “the community” (managed by governance) upon launch. With crypto market growth, that treasury’s value became enormous. This money is intended for funding development, liquidity incentives, grants, and other initiatives to grow the Uniswap ecosystem – all decided via proposals.• • 8 5 No Revenue… Yet: Interestingly, despite facilitating trades worth billions of dollars (cumulatively, Uniswap passed $1 trillion in total trading volume by 2022), the Uniswap protocol historically did not take a cut of trading fees for itself. All fees (e.g. 0.3% on swaps) went to liquidity providers by default. However , the smart contracts had a dormant “fee switch” that could divert a portion of fees to the treasury if governance voted to activate it. For a long time, this fee switch was a topic of discussion but remained off, meaning the Uniswap DAO had no direct revenue from the core protocol fees. It relied on its initial token allocation for funding. This was a deliberate early choice to prioritize growth over monetization. By 2023-2024, with the treasury large and stable, the community started actively discussing turning on the protocol fee in some pools . Various proposals emerged to test a small fee (for example, taking 0.05% out of the 0.30% fee on certain pools) which would flow to the DAO. This ignited debates: should Uniswap remain “fee-less” to stay maximally competitive, or should it reward token holders and fund itself via fees? One proposal in late 2024 by a major delegate (Wintermute) suggested trialing the fee on a subset of pools . As of mid-2025, a limited fee switch trial has been approved by governance, marking the first time Uniswap will generate protocol revenue for the DAO. This is a watershed moment: the community is effectively deciding to capture some value, potentially making Uniswap a profitable, self-sustaining public utility (with fees still far lower than any centralized exchange). The outcome of this experiment is being closely watched across DeFi. Funding Development and Ecosystem: Even without protocol fee revenue, the Uniswap DAO has been actively using its treasury for growth. In 2022, the community approved the creation of the Uniswap Foundation , granting it $74 million to support the protocol’s health and expansion. The Foundation, with a mandate from the DAO, has since issued grants to improve Uniswap’s usability, governance tooling, and to fund hackathons and research. The DAO also routinely votes on deploying Uniswap to new blockchain networks – for instance, proposals to deploy Uniswap on Layer-2 networks like Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, and even rival ecosystems like Binance Smart Chain have all gone through governance. In one notable case in early 2023, the vote to deploy on BSC became contentious when a large VC (a16z) initially used its UNI stake to vote against using a particular cross-chain bridge, raising questions about outsized influence. The matter was resolved with an eventual agreement, and Uniswap did deploy to BSC, but the episode highlighted the learning curve in decentralized governance (e.g., encouraging more widespread delegation of votes to avoid any single entity’s control). Community and Delegates: Uniswap has one of the most active governance forums and a set of “governance delegates” – individuals or teams who have accumulated voting power through other users delegating to them. These delegates (often crypto venture firms, university blockchain clubs, or independent community leaders) debate proposals in public. The Delegate Race became a new kind of politics: those with good ideas and reputation attract more UNI delegations, giving them more weight in votes. The Uniswap DAO even introduced a “Delegate Voting Incentives” program to reward delegates for thoughtful participation , essentially compensating the work of governance as a service. This reflects how running a large DAO can resemble running a government or large corporate board – it requires significant time and expertise, and communities are figuring out how to professionalize these roles. Uniswap’s significance extends beyond its own protocol. It proved the AMM (Automated Market Maker) model, once novel, could be community-owned infrastructure. By being open-source and decentralized,• 3435 35 • • 36 6 Uniswap spawned an entire DeFi industry of forked DEXs and innovations – from SushiSwap (an early “vampire attack” fork that itself became a community project) to countless others. Uniswap’s DAO had to navigate copycats and competition, yet its first-mover advantage and continual innovation (Uniswap v3’s concentrated liquidity, for example) kept it dominant. The governance recently discussed Uniswap v4 , a new upgrade – again to be decided by token holders. As of mid-2025, Uniswap stands as the blue-chip of decentralized exchanges, and its DAO is effectively the steward of a critical piece of global trading infrastructure. It showcases a path where an open protocol can achieve scale and then be governed by its users and stakeholders. With billions in its treasury and likely revenue streams coming online, the challenge ahead will be deploying those resources wisely – funding further technical research, ensuring security, and possibly even lobbying or legal defense (as regulators have started paying attention to DeFi). Uniswap’s ongoing success will hinge on whether a diverse community of token holders can continue to make savvy strategic decisions for the protocol’s long-term welfare. ENS (Ethereum Name Service): Decentralizing Digital Identity While DeFi protocols get much attention, another unsung hero of blockchain utility is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) – a decentralized naming system. ENS provides human-readable names for crypto addresses and resources (e.g. alice.eth instead of a long Ethereum address), akin to how DNS provides domain names for IP addresses. Launched in 2017, ENS became a critical piece of user-friendly infrastructure for Web3. In 2021, ENS itself embraced decentralization by forming a DAO to govern the protocol and manage its revenue, making it an illuminating example of a productive, blockchain-native “company.” Business Model: ENS generates revenue by charging fees for registrations and renewals of .eth domain names. Much like an Internet domain registry, users pay annual fees (paid in ETH) to register names. The pricing is simple and public: for example, a 5+ character name costs $5 in ETH per year , 4-character names $160/year , 3-character names $640/year . Premium short names thus carry higher fees. This model turned out to be quite lucrative during crypto’s growth – in 2022, ENS saw over 2.2 million new domain registrations amid a frenzy of interest in personal ENS names and domains as NFT-like assets . ENS’s treasury swelled as a result of all these registrations. Revenue and Treasury: By October 2024, ENS had accumulated 43,800 ETH in revenue since launch – an amount that translates to tens of millions of dollars (depending on ETH’s price). All this revenue goes into smart contracts controlled by the ENS DAO . The ENS token (ENS) was airdropped in late 2021 to users, and holders of ENS formed the DAO to oversee key parameters (like pricing, the .eth registrar contract) and to manage the funds. Unlike many DeFi DAOs that struggle with having a business model, ENS has a straightforward one and a recurring income stream from name renewals. This makes the ENS DAO more analogous to a traditional company with a clear service and revenue. Spending and Public Goods: What does the ENS DAO do with the money? A large focus has been funding public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem. ENS, as a core infrastructure, depends on a healthy Ethereum network and developer community. The DAO has allocated significant grants to developers maintaining ENS itself and related tools, as well as supporting projects that benefit the broader Web3 space (for example, contributing to client teams or community efforts). ENS DAO has also created working groups to handle key areas like the integration with DNS, wallet support, and• 3738 39 • 2425 40 • 7 marketing/education to get more users adopting ENS names. Importantly, the ENS constitution (ratified by the DAO) emphasizes ENS as a public utility – for instance, it has principles like openness and that fees should primarily be used for ENS development and the public good, not to enrich token holders directly. There is no profit-sharing or buyback of ENS token; instead, the value to token holders is in having a say in the governance of an essential piece of digital identity. Decentralized Governance Challenges: Running a naming system by committee brings unique issues. One is name policy – e.g., handling trademark disputes or offensive domain registrations. Traditionally, domain name registries have processes for these. ENS, in its decentralized spirit, has tried to minimize interventions (first-come, first-serve for names, with few restrictions). However , the DAO may face future debates on whether any names should be reserved or how to resolve competing claims. Another challenge is upgrading the protocol : for example, enabling two-letter or one-letter .eth names (currently disallowed) would require a DAO vote and careful consideration, since it could suddenly create very valuable assets out of thin air . The DAO, representing many varied stakeholders (individual users, speculators, wallets/exchanges that integrate ENS, etc.), has to reach consensus on such decisions. Despite these complexities, ENS’s transition to a DAO appears to have gone smoothly. The airdrop was widely distributed, making it harder for any single entity to control votes. Turnout for major votes has been decent, aided by delegates (like the ENS Foundation, Coinbase, and community leaders). ENS shows that even a service as “mundane” as domain name management can be effectively decentralized. The result is that no corporation controls the .eth namespace – it is a shared resource governed by its users. And because ENS smart contracts are on Ethereum, they benefit from composability; countless dApps integrated ENS such that any Ethereum address can be resolved to a name if the user has one. By 2025, seeing .eth names in Twitter bios, business cards, or chat apps has become common in crypto circles – evidence of ENS’s cultural penetration. The ENS DAO’s stewardship of this critical identity layer will be vital in the years to come, particularly as Web3 identity and reputation systems evolve. Filecoin: A Tokenized Storage Network with Decentralized Coordination Not all blockchain-based entities label themselves “DAOs,” yet still operate as decentralized networks with token-governed economies. Filecoin is one such example – essentially a decentralized version of Amazon S3 storage, underpinned by blockchain incentives. Launched in 2020 by Protocol Labs, Filecoin allows participants (storage miners) to rent out disk space to store clients’ data, earning FIL tokens as reward. The vision: create a marketplace for data storage that is cheaper , censorship-resistant, and not controlled by any single company. By mid-2025, Filecoin has become one of the largest decentralized storage networks, showing how a blockchain-native entity can be economically productive in providing real infrastructure. Scale of the Network: Filecoin’s capacity and usage figures are impressive. The network’s total storage capacity is on the order of exabytes (1 exabyte = 1,000 petabytes) – far beyond what the network initially launched with. By Q1 2024, Filecoin’s capacity was about 23 exabytes , of which around 2-3 exabytes (10–15%) was filled with actual data in active storage deals . While a significant portion of capacity is still unused (meaning supply currently outstrips demand), the utilization has been steadily growing. For instance, storage utilization grew from just ~4% in early 2023 to nearly 30% by late 2024 . This indicates real client demand for decentralized storage is materializing. By Q3 2024, over 2,000 unique clients were actively storing data on Filecoin , including some with very large datasets (hundreds of terabytes each) . Filecoin now claims to hold• • 41 4243 44 45 8 the lion’s share (almost 99%) of all data stored across decentralized storage networks , outpacing competitors like Storj or Sia. Economic Model: Filecoin’s economy involves storage providers earning FIL for adding capacity and reliably storing data, and clients spending FIL to store or retrieve data. Importantly, Filecoin introduced cryptoeconomic guarantees : miners have to lock up collateral and are penalized (lose tokens) if they fail to store data as promised. This incentivizes quality of service. As usage grows, Filecoin miners actually earn two kinds of rewards: block rewards (similar to Bitcoin mining, new FIL issuance for securing the chain) and fees from clients. In early bootstrap days, block rewards dominated (essentially subsidizing growth), but over time, client fees are expected to become the main revenue. Already, by 2025, meaningful FIL flows from clients purchasing storage – a sign that the network is heading towards a more self-sustaining marketplace. Organization and Governance: Filecoin’s governance is not as straightforwardly “on-chain DAO” as some projects. There is no single Filecoin DAO token beyond FIL itself, and protocol upgrades happen through a combination of off-chain improvement proposals (FIPs) and decisions by the development teams (Protocol Labs and an appointed Filecoin Foundation). However , the Filecoin community is highly decentralized in operation: thousands of miners worldwide, many companies building layers on top (like NFT storage services, Filecoin marketplaces, etc.), and a Filecoin Foundation that includes community-elected members. The Foundation and governance structure resemble something like Linux Foundation more than a token-holder corporation – emphasizing open-source stewardship. One could view the Filecoin storage network as a decentralized utility , with FIL token holders and miners collectively having skin in the game to see the network thrive, but not voting on every parameter via token ballot. In that sense, Filecoin is an interesting contrast: decentralized and autonomous in function, but not governed by token votes for day-to-day decisions. It illustrates that “blockchain-based entity” can take forms beyond the archetypal DAO. Product and Market Impact: Economically, Filecoin is providing a service – data storage – that has a real market price and real competitors (cloud storage giants). By 2025, Filecoin storage costs are often lower than Amazon’s, and some projects (especially in Web3, like preserving NFT metadata or housing large public datasets) prefer Filecoin for its censorship-resistance and redundancy (data is usually stored with multiple miners). A notable initiative is Filecoin’s partnership with Internet Archive and others to back up open data. The concept of decentralized CDN and compute is being built around Filecoin as well (e.g., projects like Filecoin Saturn for content delivery, and integration with IPFS for retrieval). If MakerDAO is akin to a bank and Uniswap to an exchange, Filecoin is akin to a decentralized data utility , potentially disrupting an industry beyond crypto. Its success would mean blockchain coordination extends into the realm of physical infrastructure (hard drives, data centers) managed by economic incentives rather than central management. Filecoin’s path hasn’t been entirely smooth. There were early critiques about low actual usage relative to capacity (indeed, at one point in 2022, a meme was that Filecoin had hundreds of petabytes but much of it storing copies of random data just to game rewards). The team responded by adjusting incentives to encourage useful storage and by courting enterprise use-cases. The Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) launched in 2023, adding smart contracts to the network, which enabled things like perpetual storage deals and user-programmable market logic – a step that effectively moves Filecoin closer to being governed by code and possibly community-written contracts in the future. By mid-2025, momentum is increasing with meaningful real data stored (scientific datasets, web archives, media files, etc.) and growing revenue for46 • • • 9 miners from clients. Filecoin exemplifies a blockchain-native corporate form – one could compare it to a decentralized cooperative of storage providers, all following protocol rules without a central boss, yet achieving a collective service. In the coming years, it will be telling if Filecoin can continue to chip away at centralized cloud incumbents, proving the DAO-like model in a highly competitive, capital-intensive industry. Gitcoin DAO: Funding Public Goods through Decentralized Grants Not all productive DAOs are about hard infrastructure or finance. Gitcoin DAO represents a success in the realm of social impact and public goods funding. Gitcoin started as a platform (launched in 2017) to fund open-source software developers through sponsored grants and bounties. It pioneered the concept of quadratic funding – a matching funding mechanism that relies on community contributions and a matching pool to democratically fund projects. In 2021, Gitcoin spun out of its Web2 corporate structure into a DAO with the launch of the GTC token, aiming to decentralize the governance of its grants programs and make public goods funding a community-driven endeavor . Tangible Service: Gitcoin provides a matchmaking service between builders of open-source/public projects and funders (often larger protocols or wealthy donors). Over the years, Gitcoin Grants rounds have funneled tens of millions of dollars into open source projects – everything from core Ethereum infrastructure, to climate initiatives, to educational programs. These funds come from a matching pool provided by sponsors (like the Ethereum Foundation, Uniswap, etc.) and from individual donations by the community. The quadratic funding formula means that broadly- supported projects get more from the matching pool than a single whale could direct – thus incentivizing projects to garner many small donations (a sign of community need) rather than a few large ones. Gitcoin’s model has arguably become critical infrastructure for funding digital public goods in Web3. DAO Governance: By becoming a DAO, Gitcoin handed control of key decisions – like which categories to run grants rounds for , how to allocate matching pool funds, and how to evolve the protocol – to its community (GTC token holders). It formed “workstreams” (similar to Maker’s core units) such as a Fraud Detection & Defense workstream (to combat sybil attacks on the grants system), a Public Goods Funding workstream, and others, each with their own budgets approved via governance. The DAO manages the Gitcoin platform, treasury, and brand, while also progressively decentralizing the actual grants infrastructure (replacing the earlier centralized website with a protocol called Gitcoin Grants Stack that anyone can fork and use to run their own grants program). This meta-approach – building tools so communities anywhere can fund their own public goods – is itself a public good. Economic Productivity: At first glance, Gitcoin might not seem “economically productive” in a traditional sense; it’s more of a redistribution mechanism. However , it creates value by sustaining the open-source projects that many other companies and protocols rely on. In doing so, it fills a market failure gap (public goods underfunding) using clever incentive engineering. The Gitcoin DAO itself raised a large endowment (from the token launch) to ensure its longevity. For instance, during its transition, Gitcoin received about $50 million worth of tokens for its treasury. The DAO uses those to fund the workstreams and matching pools. As long as it can demonstrate effective allocation (and thus keep partners and the community engaged), it sustains a virtuous cycle. Indeed, major protocols continue to contribute to Gitcoin rounds because they see it as an efficient way to support• • • 10 the ecosystem (for example, Uniswap or Optimism directing some of their treasury to match funding on Gitcoin instead of picking grantees themselves, outsourcing the decision to the crowd). Results: By mid-2025, Gitcoin has facilitated funding of over $50 million to thousands of projects since inception. Many Ethereum infrastructure improvements, community resources, and even novel organizations (like Optimism’s retroactive public goods experiments ) have roots in Gitcoin. Gitcoin DAO itself has inspired other “impact DAOs” – for example, ClimateDAO and Blockchain for Social Impact initiatives that use similar democratic funding approaches. It demonstrates that a DAO can excel at a coordination task that is hard for traditional organizations : globally distributed micro-philanthropy. Where a government or corporation might struggle to justify funding a niche open-source library used by a handful of devs (even if it’s critical), Gitcoin’s decentralized mechanism finds and funds such needs through collective action. However , Gitcoin DAO faces governance challenges too: avoiding collusion or gaming of quadratic funding (there have been instances of fake identities to milk matching funds, which the DAO has to combat with algorithms and moderation), and managing the politics of which causes to support (the community had debates on whether to expand beyond software into realms like climate change or local community projects). These are healthy debates for a democratic system to have. Gitcoin’s governance has generally erred on side of plurality – allowing various themed rounds and letting users decide via donations which specific projects get funded. In summary, Gitcoin DAO’s success is not in profit but in impact. It has institutionalized public goods funding in the crypto space and provided a blueprint for decentralized altruism. Its economic productivity is measured in robust open-source code and empowered communities rather than direct revenue – yet that indirectly bolsters the entire Web3 economy. As we consider the broader narrative of productive DAOs, Gitcoin reminds us that “productivity” can also mean producing social value and infrastructure that doesn’t show up on a balance sheet. (The above case studies are just a selection; there are many other notable DAO-driven projects. Honorable mentions include Lido DAO , which operates the largest liquid staking service (with over $14 billion in staked assets and a revenue model of taking a small commission on staking rewards), Aave and Compound governing large decentralized lending pools, dYdX evolving into a DAO for a high-volume derivatives exchange, Nouns DAO creating a unique self-perpetuating NFT art community that funds eclectic ventures, and Shapeshift DAO , which transformed a traditional crypto company into a community-run project. Each illustrates different facets of what blockchain-native organizations can achieve.) Global Legal and Regulatory Frameworks for DAOs As DAOs and blockchain-based entities proliferate, they increasingly bump up against legal systems designed for more centralized organizations. How can a leaderless online collective enter a contract, or be held liable, or open a bank account? Around the world, regulators and legislators are waking up to these questions. Mid-2025 finds a patchwork of approaches to giving DAOs legal recognition (or imposing obligations on them). Here we survey major jurisdictions:• 11 United States – State Pioneers and Federal Uncertainty In the U.S., no federal law specifically recognizes DAOs yet. However , several states have enacted groundbreaking legislation to allow DAOs to register as legal entities, usually a variant of a Limited Liability Company (LLC): Wyoming: In July 2021, Wyoming became the first state (and effectively first government in the world) to pass a law explicitly acknowledging DAOs. Wyoming’s law created the concept of a “DAO LLC” , essentially allowing a DAO to register as an LLC with minimal management structure. The law (Wyoming Statute §17-31-101 et seq.) lets the DAO define its governance in smart contract terms, and importantly provides that token holders aren’t personally liable for debts – mirroring the shield of an LLC . The only additional requirement is including a notice in the articles of organization that it is a decentralized organization. This gives DAOs a clear path to legal personality in Wyoming. Indeed, the first DAO LLC, American CryptoFed DAO, registered in Wyoming in 2021 . (CryptoFed’s subsequent saga – it was later pursued by the SEC over its token – hints at unresolved federal issues, but the state-level recognition held.) Wyoming further amended its DAO law in 2022 to refine details, showing commitment to staying ahead. Tennessee: In April 2022, Tennessee followed suit, passing its own DAO Supplement to the state’s LLC Act . Tennessee’s framework is similar to Wyoming’s: a DAO can be “wrapped” in an LLC form by including a statement in its charter . The goal was to attract blockchain ventures to the state. Tennessee’s law underscored that normal LLC rules apply unless they conflict with the idea of a DAO . In practice, this means a Tennessee DAO LLC might still file annual reports, but it might not have a traditional operating agreement – the blockchain smart contract can serve as the operating agreement. Utah: Utah leapfrogged others with a more novel approach in 2023 by enacting the Utah Decentralized Autonomous Organizations Act , which took effect in 2024. Utah’s law creates a new legal entity form called the “Limited Liability DAO” (LLD) , not just an LLC wrapper . It grants limited liability to DAO members and explicitly addresses issues like on-chain contributions and judgments. Uniquely, Utah’s act states that if a DAO doesn’t pay a legal judgment against it, members who voted against using treasury assets to satisfy the judgment can be held personally liable up to the extent of their governance share . This is an interesting twist to prevent DAOs from using decentralization to dodge debts: if the DAO refuses to comply with a court order to pay someone, those who actively blocked payment can be pinpointed. Utah also made clear that developers or participants of a DAO do not automatically owe fiduciary duties to each other just by their roles – clarifying a concern that might arise in common law if a partnership were assumed. Overall, Utah’s law is seen as quite comprehensive in dealing with DAO idiosyncrasies. It even contemplates DAO subdivisions (series DAOs) , akin to how Delaware series LLCs work, which could allow a master DAO to have sub-DAOs with separate liability (Wyoming later considered similar via an amendment). Vermont: Even before Wyoming, Vermont had a 2018 law for “Blockchain-Based LLCs” (BBLLCs). This wasn’t DAO-specific, but allowed an LLC to register that some of its records or governance are on a blockchain. One of the first projects to use this was dOrg , a developer collective that became a Vermont BBLLC in 2019 – often cited as the first legally registered DAO in a broad sense. Vermont’s• 4748 • 49 47 • 50 51 52 • 12 approach is a bit more manual and requires filing the blockchain governance protocol with the state in an archive form. It hasn’t seen as much uptake as Wyoming’s more straightforward law. At the federal level , DAOs operate in a gray zone. U.S. regulators have not created DAO-specific rules, but they are applying existing laws on securities, commodities, etc., to DAO activities. A cautionary precedent came in 2022 when the CFTC took enforcement action against Ooki DAO , a DeFi trading protocol’s DAO, treating it as an unincorporated association of token holders and holding that association accountable for illegal offerings. The CFTC even served the DAO notice via an online forum – a controversial move. In 2023, a federal court entered a default judgment against Ooki DAO for not responding, effectively reinforcing that a DAO (and by extension its voters) could be legally liable if not wrapped in an entity. This put the community on notice: without a legal wrapper, U.S. law may view a DAO as a general partnership , meaning every member could be on the hook for the DAO’s actions. That realization is one driver for why many DAOs, especially those touching regulated activities, started seeking LLC or foundation wrappers in friendly jurisdictions. There have been attempts at federal legislation: notably the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act (introduced in 2022, updated in 2023) contained provisions to clarify DAO status under U.S. law – requiring DAOs to register and perhaps incorporate to get liability protections, in exchange for tax clarity. As of mid-2025, however , this bill has not passed, and the U.S. Congress is still deliberating comprehensive crypto legislation. So the state-level initiatives fill the void. Delaware , the traditional corporate haven, has not yet enacted DAO-specific statutes, but one can form a standard LLC for a DAO there too (some high-profile DAOs, like The LAO – an investment club DAO – did just that, using a legal wrapper LLC in Delaware and treating token holders akin to members of a managed fund). In summary, within the U.S., Wyoming, Tennessee, and Utah are the vanguard of DAO legal recognition. Their laws offer DAOs a home with legal personhood and limited liability, potentially avoiding the pitfalls of being seen as common law partnerships. That said, using these frameworks is still new – only a modest number of DAOs have registered under them. For example, by late 2023, Wyoming had a few dozen DAO LLCs formed, but not hundreds. The Marshall Islands (discussed below) ironically saw more volume in DAO registrations than any U.S. state, despite being a small nation. And whichever state a DAO registers in, it still faces overarching U.S. federal laws on securities (the SEC has hinted many governance tokens could be unregistered securities) and tax (the IRS has not given DAO-specific guidance yet, creating ambiguity in how to report DAO income or token distributions). United Kingdom – Common Law Flexibility and a Wait-and-See Approach The UK does not yet have a DAO act or a new entity form dedicated to DAOs. However , the British legal system has been actively studying the phenomenon. In 2022, the UK Government asked the Law Commission to conduct a thorough review of how DAOs fit into current English law and whether any reforms were needed. The Law Commission’s Scoping Paper on DAOs , published in July 2024, provides one of the most detailed analyses by any government advisory body on this topic . Key points from the Law Commission’s findings: No New Entity Form (for now): The Law Commission concluded that England’s existing legal forms are sufficient for DAOs at this stage , and it did not recommend creating a bespoke DAO entity form immediately . Essentially, they found that DAOs can usually be categorized under some existing concept like a partnership or an unincorporated association, and members can always5354 • 55 13 create a legal wrapper (like a private company or LLP) if they want. Rather than rush to legislate a new structure, they suggested monitoring the space and possibly revisiting after more evidence. They noted that introducing a DAO-specific company form might be premature and perhaps even counterproductive if technology is still evolving. Legal Characterization: Under English law, a group of people acting together without an entity will often be treated as an unincorporated association (if for non-profits) or a partnership (if carrying on a business with intent to profit). The Law Commission discussed how many pure DAOs – especially those who deliberately avoid legal formality – could default to these characterizations . The downside is, unincorporated associations and partnerships don’t have limited liability or separate legal personality. The Commission noted that some DAOs might not mind that (if truly autonomous code, etc.), but participants should be aware of the risks. They also pointed out that English law allows a lot of flexibility – people can sign contracts via agents even without an entity, for instance – but it also means members might have unintended liabilities if a DAO does something that creates debt or legal obligation . Areas to Watch: The report identified particular legal issues: how to handle property held by a DAO (since an unincorporated association can’t hold assets in its own name, usually a trust or nominee structure is needed), how dispute resolution would work, and how to fit DAOs into existing regulatory frameworks (for example, a DAO running a stock exchange would still need a license; who is the accountable party?). The Commission recommended further study, particularly in trust law – intriguingly suggesting that upcoming reforms in trust law could consider DAOs, perhaps imagining DAO treasuries being held in some kind of legal trust as a solution . General Guidance: The Law Commission’s work signaled to the industry that, in the UK, one can use existing company forms to wrap a DAO if desired (and indeed some UK-based projects have set up companies or partnerships to represent the DAO in deals). If not, the participants should at least have a members agreement to clarify rights and duties off-chain. The UK also considered clarifying when a DAO’s token might be a security or when the activities might trigger existing laws (similar to general cryptoasset guidance that the Financial Conduct Authority is developing in parallel). The UK government, via HM Treasury, has been friendly to crypto innovation on paper (London often states aims to be a “global crypto hub”). They’ve addressed things like stablecoin regulation and crypto promotion rules, but DAO-specific legislation is not on the immediate agenda . Instead, the approach is common-law adaptability – letting DAOs utilize flexible constructs. For example, a DAO could register as a Private Limited Company or LLP and just encode its governance rules in a smart contract appended to its articles. It’s not sexy, but it works under the law. One example: LexDAO , a collective of legal engineers, considered the UK’s Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) structure for a global DAO framework – because an LLP can give partnership-like flexibility but with limited liability for members. LexDAO hasn’t publicly announced a UK registration, but it shows how UK entities might be repurposed for DAO needs. Another interesting development: UK Jurisdiction Taskforce (a legal body) issued statements that cryptoassets and smart contracts are recognized under English law (which indirectly gives comfort that a smart contract governance decision would likely be respected as an agreement). • 56 57 5859 • 55 • 14 In summary, the UK is taking a cautious but not obstructionist stance . By not creating a new law yet, it’s effectively saying “DAOs are welcome, and we think the current legal system can accommodate you through existing channels, but we’re keeping an eye on whether that remains true.” The Law Commission’s work will likely inform policy changes down the line, potentially making targeted adjustments rather than broad new DAO statutes. European Union – Slow and Steady via Existing Frameworks (and MiCA) The European Union as a bloc has not crafted DAO-specific legislation as of 2025. Instead, its focus has been on regulating crypto-assets and related service providers (exchanges, custodians) through frameworks like MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) , which was passed in 2023 and is rolling out over 2024–2025. MiCA establishes rules for issuance of tokens (especially stablecoins and utility tokens) and for crypto-asset service providers, but it doesn’t directly address DAO governance or legal personality. However , there are a few relevant points: Token Classification: If a DAO’s token is considered a “utility token” under MiCA (basically a catch-all for tokens that are not payment tokens or financial instruments), an issuance of it might require a light whitepaper and notification to regulators, but not full securities regulation. If it’s deemed a security token, then traditional prospectus and MiFID rules might apply. This means DAOs in Europe have to tread carefully on how they distribute tokens – the larger ones have generally avoided direct token sales to the public in the EU to not trigger prospectus rules. As such, some DAOs exclude U.S. and EU from token airdrops or sales to be safe, or they go through regulatory sandboxes. Company Law and Cooperatives: Europe has a variety of legal vehicles across its member states. Several blockchain projects have used foundations (Stiftung in German, Fondation in French) – notably in Switzerland, but also in places like the Netherlands or Austria – to have a legal body overseeing a protocol. Foundations typically are non-profit and can hold funds for a cause (like developing a protocol) without shareholders. Many early crypto networks (Ethereum, Tezos, Cardano, etc.) had foundations. While a foundation is not a DAO, it can serve as a legal proxy for one – e.g., the foundation might ultimately execute the on-chain votes’ decisions in the off-chain legal world if needed. In the EU, cooperative associations are another possible model. Cooperatives are member-owned businesses traditionally used for everything from agriculture to banking. A DAO could fit conceptually as a cooperative (members = token holders, profits shared or reinvested). Some legal scholars have suggested using the European Cooperative Society statute or national co-op laws to wrap DAOs. So far , we haven’t seen a prominent DAO do this in the EU, but it’s a logical path if a DAO wanted an EU presence. National Initiatives: A few EU member states have signaled interest in DAOs. For instance, Germany in late 2022 had political discussions in the context of its blockchain strategy about enabling “crypto cooperatives” (nothing concrete yet). France amended its legal framework in 2021 to allow registration of a “profit-based company for the development of a shared digital resource” (Société à mission L.210-10) which some equate to a DAO-enabling form, but it’s not widely used in crypto. Malta (an EU member known for crypto businesses) has a DAO-like vehicle in its legal texts via the concept of “Innovative Technology Arrangements” that could apply to DAOs – though again, not widely applied in practice as of 2025. Overall, the EU approach is more wait for international consensus .• • • 15 AML and Responsibility: One area the EU has been more aggressive is Anti-Money Laundering (AML). A proposed EU Anti-Money Laundering Regulation debated in 2022-2023 included provisions that could impact DeFi and DAOs. At one point, the European Parliament’s draft suggested that DeFi platforms should always have a “legal person” identified who could be responsible for AML compliance , effectively challenging the notion of a fully autonomous, unhosted protocol. For example, if a DAO runs a DEX, EU might later require someone (perhaps the largest token holders or founders) to be named to perform customer due diligence if the volumes are significant. These ideas are controversial and not finalized, but they indicate that Europe might use broad regulations (like AML/CFT rules) to indirectly force some centralization or at least accountability in DAOs offering financial services to Europeans. For a DAO looking to have legal clarity in Europe, a popular choice has been to incorporate in Switzerland or other crypto-friendly European jurisdictions (Liechtenstein, for example, though not EU, is EEA). Which brings us to: Switzerland and Liechtenstein – Crypto Valley’s Legal Innovations Switzerland, while not in the EU, has been a hub for crypto projects and arguably pioneered the concept of foundation-run blockchain projects. The Swiss have not created a DAO law per se, but the existing legal toolbox has been leveraged creatively: Foundations: The Ethereum Foundation set the template by establishing in Zug, Switzerland as a non-profit foundation to launch Ethereum. Since then, many DAOs or protocol communities have used foundations (Swiss or elsewhere) to handle legal matters (owning trademarks, signing contracts, employing core devs) in parallel to on-chain governance. A foundation can be structured to basically follow the DAO’s instructions – e.g., the foundation’s board might be comprised of respected community members who execute community decisions. Swiss foundations are heavily regulated (they need regulatory approval, can’t easily change their purpose, etc.), but they give confidence to regulators that someone is legally accountable. Associations: Swiss law also has the Verein , a simple association of members, which can be formed by any group and does have legal personality in Switzerland. It’s like a club. Some smaller DAO communities have reportedly used the Verein structure to have something that can, say, open a bank account. It’s relatively easy to set up (no minimum capital) and Swiss associations can engage in commerce as long as it’s incidental to their non-profit purpose. This could suit a protocol community – they could have the association hold funds and property on behalf of the DAO members. Liechtenstein’s Blockchain Act: Tiny Liechtenstein (EEA member) passed one of the most forward- thinking laws in 2019 – the Token and Trusted Technology Service Provider Act , commonly known as the Blockchain Act . It provides a legal basis for tokenizing all kinds of assets and for creating new entities around them. In particular , Liechtenstein introduced the concept of a “DAO-like entity” called a Token-Container Model , and allows setting up smart contract systems with legal personality by registering them as a type of company or trust. One can establish a Liechtenstein foundation or trust and have its governance automated via smart contract , effectively creating a legally recognized DAO structure. Also notable, Liechtenstein explicitly permits “Smart Contract Systems” that are not traditional entities but still can be given legal capacity to hold rights if• • • • 60 16 registered. This law is complex but essentially Liechtenstein said: we’ll recognize whatever form you bring as long as you declare it and assign responsibility for compliance. As a result, Liechtenstein is cited as a DAO-friendly jurisdiction, though like others, adoption is limited to those willing to navigate its relatively high setup costs and regulatory oversight. Other Crypto Hubs: Singapore and Hong Kong deserve mention as they have become bases for many crypto projects post-2021, though they don’t have explicit DAO laws. Singapore often uses the Variable Capital Company (VCC) or standard Private Limited Company for projects, and has a robust legal system for companies and trusts. Hong Kong in 2023 reopened to crypto with new exchange licensing, but no DAO framework yet. Still, many DAOs (or their treasuries) are effectively run out of entities in such hubs for convenience. Asia-Pacific: Japan’s Embrace of DAO LLCs, China’s Caution, Australia’s Consideration Japan has emerged as a surprising champion of DAOs in East Asia. Long known for a strong tech sector but conservative finance laws, Japan in 2022-2023 took steps to legally recognize DAOs and reduce friction for them: In 2023, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) proposed an ordinance change to allow DAOs to register as legal entities akin to LLCs (Godo Kaisha) . The problem was that under previous law, tokenizing membership in an LLC could trigger strict securities rules (Paragraph I securities). The FSA’s revision was to treat DAO tokens as “membership rights” that are exempt from heavy regulation (classified as Paragraph II securities, simpler) under certain conditions . Essentially, Japan is enabling LLCs that issue tokenized equity to operate more freely . They recognized that requiring every transfer of a DAO token to come with traditional disclosures was impractical, so they created a lighter regime. This came on the heels of a broader pro-Web3 stance by Japan’s ruling party, which in its 2023 Web3 white paper explicitly called for establishing a legal framework for DAOs as a growth strategy . The government sees potential in DAOs for regional revitalization and innovation . The identified issues in Japan were lack of limited liability and clarity on member obligations if DAOs weren’t recognized . The recommendation – now being executed – was to leverage the existing Godo Kaisha (GK) structure (similar to an LLC) with modifications. One modification discussed was removing the need to list all members’ names/addresses in incorporation documents (since token holders can be pseudonymous) . This would be a huge adaptation because current GK law requires member info on public record, which is anathema to global token holders. As of early 2024, Japan started a public comment process on these changes , and by mid-2025 the expectation is the new rules will be in effect or imminent. This likely means Japan will allow a DAO to register , issue governance tokens as proof of membership, and not have to update the legal registry with each token transfer . If they pull this off, Japan might become a DAO magnet in Asia due to its large economy and regulatory clarity. Already, companies like Sony and animation studios have experimented with issuing fan tokens or NFT-based voting, which could expand under a clear DAO regime. Meanwhile, China has largely taken an opposite approach by clamping down on cryptocurrency usage and ICOs since 2017. The concept of a decentralized organization with a freely floating token is at odds with• • 6162 63 64 • 65 66 67 68 6669 • 70 17 China’s desire for financial control. As of 2025, DAOs have no legal recognition in China – in fact, public crypto token issuance is essentially banned. However , China is very bullish on “blockchain not crypto.” They have supported consortium blockchains (like the Blockchain Service Network) and even local governments exploring distributed ledgers for data sharing. One could envision quasi-DAOs without tokens being used in permitted contexts (for example, a consortium of banks jointly governing a trade finance network). But Chinese law requires entities to have a registered business or social organization license. An unincorporated DAO would likely be deemed an illegal association or worse. Some Chinese projects simply incorporate overseas (Singapore or HK) to pursue DAO-like structures externally. Culturally, the ethos of DAOs (open, leaderless, global) doesn’t mesh well with the PRC’s regulatory environment. Unless China changes its stance on crypto, it will likely remain hostile to true DAOs. Australia had a notable moment in 2021 when a Senate committee report (“Australia as a Technology and Financial Centre”) recommended establishing a new DAO company structure . This sparked hope that Australia might be among the first to legislatively recognize DAOs. After a government change, progress slowed, but not stalled: In early 2022, that committee’s proposals were taken up in principle, and the Treasury did consult on treating DAOs similarly to limited partnerships or companies. The idea would be to let them register and get limited liability if they meet certain transparency requirements (like providing an identifier for legal service). As of 2025, Australia hasn’t passed specific DAO legislation. However , it’s reportedly working on a broader crypto regulatory framework (covering exchanges, custody, etc.) where DAOs might get a mention. In absence of a new law, Australian projects treat DAOs as partnerships. Indeed, a legal analysis by researchers in 2023 noted DAOs are arguably partnerships under Australian law by default . This means Australian DAO members could face joint liability. This is an impetus for law reform. Notably, Australia already has “Cooperative” entities and Aboriginal corporations law that allow collective ownership – these could provide templates. Other Jurisdictions – Marshall Islands’ Bold Move and Global Trends One of the most striking developments came from the tiny Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) . In 2022, the RMI passed its DAO Act , becoming the first sovereign nation to nationally recognize DAOs as legal entities. The Marshall Islands, known for offshore company registrations (like shipping companies) and an association with the US, saw an opportunity to attract Web3 business: The original 2022 law allowed DAOs to incorporate as nonprofit LLCs in the Marshall Islands. Key features included no requirement for a traditional board of directors , acceptance of blockchain records as official records , and allowing nearly all members to remain anonymous (only one authorized rep needs to provide KYC) . This was very accommodating – essentially they stripped away many formalities of incorporation for DAOs. By late 2023, the RMI amended the law to make it even more attractive. They reduced registration processing time to under 30 days , provided explicit immunity so that DAOs aren’t liable just for creating open-source software (addressing fears that writing code could trigger liability) , and, importantly, clarified that governance tokens are not securities in the Marshall Islands if they don’t confer profit rights . That securities clarification is a big deal: it’s a national law saying essentially if a token is purely for governance, the Marshall Islands won’t treat it as a stock/share. • • • 71 • 72 • 73 73 73 18 The Marshall Islands also introduced Series DAO LLCs in this update, meaning a DAO can create sub-DAO “series” under the umbrella, each with ring-fenced assets/liabilities . This is cutting- edge, as even most US DAO laws don’t explicitly mention series yet. The results: almost 100 DAOs incorporated in the Marshall Islands within the first year or so . That’s significant given the country’s size. An entity called MIDAO (a public-private partnership) was set up to help DAOs register there . The RMI sees this as a burgeoning niche akin to how Delaware dominates LLCs – if they could be the preferred incorporation site for DAOs globally, it’s an economic opportunity. Other countries with emerging frameworks or that are commonly used by DAOs include: Cayman Islands (many investment DAOs register as Cayman funds or foundations due to favorable laws and tax neutrality), British Virgin Islands (BVI) , Singapore (as mentioned), Dubai/UAE (in 2023 Dubai set up a crypto regulator VARA and free zones that might accommodate DAO foundations), and Panama (which passed a crypto law in 2022 that, if it hadn’t been vetoed partially, might have included DAO provisions). Global Legislation Trend: The general movement is toward optionality . Jurisdictions that want to attract Web3 business are offering legal wrapper options to DAOs: be it a DAO LLC, a foundation, or some new form. Those that are more cautious (like EU, UK) are observing and using existing company law to handle it for now. And a few (China, some others) are resistant outright. For DAOs themselves, this means there is growing legal interoperability : a DAO launched on Ethereum can choose to register in Marshall Islands for limited liability, have a Swiss association for operations, or form a Wyoming LLC – whatever suits its needs – without changing its fundamental on-chain nature. We should note a curious scenario: as soon as a DAO registers, purists argue “it’s no longer a DAO, it’s just a company using a multisig.” There is some philosophical tension. But practically, many DAOs now present themselves as a “DAO + legal entity” combo to get the best of both worlds: on-chain governance and community vibes, plus an interface to the off-chain world for legal matters. For example, CityDAO (a project that bought land in Wyoming to form a blockchain-governed town) became one of the first Wyoming DAO LLCs, nicely aligning its on-chain ethos with a legal wrapper to own the deed to the land. Another example: KlimaDAO , a carbon credit DAO, set up a legal entity in the Cayman Islands to hold the real-world carbon assets that back its tokens, since someone had to sign contracts with carbon credit registries. Regulators beyond incorporation are also grappling with how to ensure DAOs comply with laws without stifling innovation . Some forward-looking regulators engage directly with DAO communities. In 2024, a few DAO delegates were even invited to speak in parliamentary hearings (e.g., in the EU and UK inquiries). There’s a recognition that decentralized doesn’t mean lawless – but it does require adapted legal thinking. For instance, how do you serve legal notice to a DAO? Marshall Islands says via posting on the DAO’s website or blockchain transaction to the DAO’s address is acceptable service – a novel concept. One can foresee that by the late 2020s, more countries will implement DAO statutes, perhaps learning from Wyoming and Marshall Islands as templates. The “race to attract DAOs” could be akin to the race for fintech or crypto exchange business – with some jurisdictions offering sandbox environments. Already, Dubai announced in 2023 it was looking into DAOs under its Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) framework, potentially to allow them as foundation-like entities.• 74 • 75 76 19 Conclusion: Where Decentralized Ownership Stands in 2025 In the span of just a few years, DAOs and blockchain-native organizations have evolved from an experimental concept to a flourishing arena of economic innovation. As of mid-2025, we see functional DAOs operating at scales that rival mid-sized corporations , with treasuries in the billions and user bases in the millions. They are delivering real products – financial services, marketplaces, infrastructure networks, creative ventures – that impact people well beyond the crypto niche. Equally important, they are pioneering new organizational structures that challenge our classical notions of firms and nonprofits. In a DAO, stakeholders can be global, pseudonymous, fluid in participation – yet the entity can still produce coherent outcomes like a stablecoin or a piece of software or a funded community project. This is a remarkable organizational feat enabled by blockchain coordination tools. Legally and socially, the world is catching up to this reality. Progressive jurisdictions are creating legal bridges to connect DAOs with the traditional system, granting them recognition and legitimacy. At the same time, regulators are learning to enforce laws (against fraud, money laundering, investor harm) in contexts where there may be no CEO to handcuff – raising complex issues of collective responsibility and code-as- law. The push-pull between decentralization and regulation will likely define the next phase of DAO evolution. We may see the emergence of “regulated DAOs” that voluntarily comply with certain standards to gain mainstream trust (for instance, auditing their code, verifying some identities, or insuring against failures) alongside more cypherpunk DAOs that remain purely on-chain and autonomous. One theme that stands out is resilience through decentralization . Some early DAOs stumbled – hacks, governance attacks, or simply lack of direction. But the successful ones we profiled navigated crises and adapted: MakerDAO survived a market crash and improved its systems; Uniswap faced copycats and captured its community to stay dominant; ENS transitioned from a centralized admin to a DAO without service disruption. Decentralized ownership, when broadly distributed, can make an organization surprisingly robust because there is no single point of failure – be it a person or a server – and the community can route around obstacles. In 2025 we even saw examples of DAOs outlasting traditional companies: consider that Shapeshift (the company) laid off all employees but Shapeshift (the DAO) lives on with volunteers and contributors continuing development. We also observe convergence between traditional and DAO models . Traditional companies are learning from DAOs – for instance, some Web2 startups are implementing token-based reward programs or more participatory decision-making for their user communities. On the flip side, DAOs are borrowing from traditional management when needed – employing project managers, adopting HR-like practices for contributors, doing user research and marketing, etc., albeit under the DAO’s governance umbrella. The line between a “DAO” and a “regular company” may blur as hybrids emerge (e.g., a corporation that tokenizes some shares for community governance, or a DAO that hires a centralized service firm for execution of certain tasks). By mid-2025, decentralized ownership is concretely taking root in areas like finance (billions in decentralized loans and trades), culture (community-owned brands and art collections), and infrastructure (user-run networks). The macro significance is that individuals around the world can band together , pool capital, and build things of value without needing a formal incorporation in one jurisdiction or permission from authorities – until they intersect with the physical world’s requirements. This bottom-up economic organizing could unlock a great deal of entrepreneurial energy, especially for global public goods and open- source projects that struggled under grant funding models. 20 Of course, challenges remain. DAO governance processes can be slow or contentious; voter apathy can concentrate power in a few hands (whales or active delegates); legal uncertainty can scare off participants; and security risks are ever-present (a bug in a smart contract treasury can be catastrophic). Moreover , the inclusivity of DAOs is still an issue – those with technical savvy or financial heft have more influence in many cases, and real-world diversity (gender , geography) in many DAO communities is not yet at parity. These are areas for improvement to fulfill the promise that DAOs can be more meritocratic and community-driven than legacy organizations. Nonetheless, the trajectory is positive. DAOs have weathered bear markets and regulatory crackdowns, and yet here they are in 2025, more numerous, better funded, and more legally understood than ever . Places like Wyoming and the Marshall Islands took leaps of faith that paid off by attracting innovators. Projects like Maker , Uniswap, ENS, Filecoin, and Gitcoin proved that decentralized models can deliver value reliably and even efficiently. Perhaps the most powerful testament is that some users interacting with these services may not even realize a “DAO” is behind them – they simply see a stablecoin that holds its peg, an exchange that provides liquidity, a name service that works, or a grants program that pays out. That invisibility of the organizational form, when things work smoothly, is success in a way: it means DAOs are becoming a normal part of the digital economy’s plumbing. As we look beyond 2025, one can imagine DAOs entering more traditional industries: maybe a “DAO insurance mutual” that provides coverage, or a “distributed energy DAO” where solar panel owners pool and govern an energy grid. Already there’s talk of “DeSci” (decentralized science) where DAOs fund research (VitaDAO for longevity science is a leading example, having invested in research that led to a biotech startup). Decentralized ownership is poised to penetrate sectors wherever communities have strong shared goals and the need to coordinate resources globally . The case studies and legal developments thus far provide a foundation of knowledge to build on. In the grand narrative of technology and commerce, DAOs represent a new chapter in how humans organize: blending the power of the internet, cryptography, and game theory to form organizations that are more open and distributed. Mid-2025 marks the end of the beginning for that story – the point where DAOs have proven their viability. The chapters to come will determine just how far this model can go in reshaping economies and societies. But it’s clear that the genie is out of the bottle: decentralized autonomous organizations, in various forms, are here to stay , and they’re already hard at work producing goods, services, and innovations that are very much part of the “real” world.
