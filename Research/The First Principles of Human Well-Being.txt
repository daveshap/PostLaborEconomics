The First Principles of Human Well-Being
Introduction
What do human beings fundamentally need in order to feel good and thrive? This question has echoed
from  ancient  philosophers  to  modern  scientists,  and  today  it  drives  a  rigorous  search  for  the  “first
principles” of well-being. It turns out that the answer is neither esoteric nor purely subjective. Growing
evidence suggests our happiness and health depend on a core set of conditions – patterns of living,
relating, and thinking that are rooted in our evolutionary past and confirmed by contemporary science. In
this report, we will explore these conditions by drawing on evolutionary biology, clinical psychology, and
cross-cultural  data.  Weaving  together  insights  from  theories  like  Roger  Walsh’s  Therapeutic  Lifestyle
Changes,  Self-Determination  Theory,  and  William  Glasser’s  Choice  Theory,  alongside  findings  from
longitudinal cohort studies and international comparisons, we aim to distill the universal needs that drive
human well-being. The approach will be empirical and unsentimental, but the implications touch on the
poetry of everyday life: how the human animal can flourish in body, mind, and community.
To understand what makes us thrive, it helps to start where we began. For over 99% of our species’ history,
humans lived as hunter-gatherers in small bands. Our Pleistocene ancestors roamed under open skies,
foraging and cooperating to survive. They were almost constantly active, slept when it got dark, awoke with
the sun, and rarely spent time alone. Life was physically arduous and often dangerous, yet it offered deep
interpersonal connection and a visceral engagement with nature. Our evolutionary heritage  endowed us
with certain biological and psychological expectations – a kind of blueprint for well-being. We carry the
same Stone Age bodies and brains into the 21st century, but we now find ourselves in a radically different
world  of  high-rises,  smartphones,  and  processed  foods.  This  mismatch  between  ancient  needs  and
modern environments  has become a central explanation for many of today’s health struggles . As
one review put it, modern populations are often  “overfed, malnourished, sedentary, sunlight-deficient, sleep-
deprived, and socially-isolated” , a lifestyle gulf away from the conditions we evolved for . This evolutionary
perspective doesn’t romanticize a brutal past; rather , it illuminates why certain inputs – like movement,
sunlight, sleep, and social bonds – remain essential nutrients for our well-being, and why deviating too far
from them can exact a mental and physical toll.
Evolutionary Needs and Modern Mismatches
The concept of  evolutionary mismatch  helps explain why we sometimes suffer even amidst material
plenty. Our bodies and minds are tuned to an environment that no longer exists. For example, humans
evolved to crave calorie-rich foods in an era of scarcity; now we are surrounded by cheap sugars and fats,
leading to metabolic diseases. We evolved to be active because survival demanded it; now technology and
office jobs encourage us to sit for hours, breeding chronic illness. We evolved to live in tight-knit tribes; now
many people drift through days in relative isolation or anonymous crowds. The result of these mismatches
is  evident  in  the  rising  burden  of  “diseases  of  civilization”  –  not  only  obesity  and  diabetes,  but  also
depression, anxiety, and loneliness . A study in the Journal of Affective Disorders  noted that “general and
specific characteristics of modernization correlate with higher [depression] risk”  and pointed to declining social
capital, sedentariness, and poor diet as contributors to a “depressiogenic” milieu . In other words,12

many features of contemporary life – from processed food to screen-based entertainment to fragmented
families  –  may  be  fundamentally  at  odds  with  the  conditions  under  which  our  psyches  prosper .  The
implication is that restoring well-being may require realigning our lifestyles with the basic inputs our minds
and bodies expect. What are those inputs? Both ancient wisdom and modern research converge on a set of
universal  needs :  robust  social  ties,  a  sense  of  autonomy  and  competence,  physical  vitality  through
movement and rest, engagement with the natural world, and a guiding sense of meaning or purpose.
From  a  top-level  view,  these  needs  are  strikingly  consistent  across  various  theoretical  frameworks.
Psychologists Edward Deci and Richard Ryan, for instance, have demonstrated that humans everywhere
require  three basic psychological nutrients  – autonomy, competence, and relatedness – to thrive .
According to Self-Determination Theory, satisfying these needs provides  “essential nutrients for individual
psychological health and well-being” , whereas thwarting them leads to distress . William Glasser’s Choice
Theory likewise proposes that five genetic needs drive all human behavior:  “survival, love and belonging,
power, freedom, and fun.”  These are considered hardwired imperatives – we seek to survive and be safe, to
connect and love, to achieve and feel empowered, to have freedom, and to experience enjoyment . The
overlap  between  these  models  is  obvious.  “Love  and  belonging”  maps  onto  relatedness;  “power”  and
achievement map onto competence or mastery; “freedom” mirrors autonomy; and even the need for “fun”
underscores the importance of play, novelty, and joy for a well-lived life. Meanwhile, Therapeutic Lifestyle
Changes (TLCs) , a framework developed by psychiatrist Roger Walsh, emphasizes actionable pathways to
fulfill these needs and improve mental health. Walsh’s exhaustive review of clinical evidence identifies eight
key  lifestyle  factors  with  outsize  benefits  for  wellbeing:  exercise,  nutrition  and  diet,  time  in  nature,
restorative sleep and relaxation, social relationships, recreation (play), meditation or spiritual practice, and
service to others . Notably, these are not high-tech interventions or luxury privileges – they are basic
activities and connections that our ancestors would recognize. They are also strikingly concordant with what
evolution would predict and what modern data confirm.
Physical Foundations: Movement, Rest, and Diet
Any discussion of well-being must start with the physical foundations . Our brains, after all, are part of our
bodies, and a healthy mind is hard to sustain in an ailing vessel. Regular  physical activity  may be the
closest thing to a universal panacea. Exercise has profound effects on the brain’s chemistry and architecture
–  boosting  mood-regulating  neurotransmitters,  promoting  neurogenesis,  improving  sleep  quality,  and
reducing inflammation. Clinically, exercise has been shown to rival or exceed standard treatments for some
mental disorders. For example, a 2023 network meta-analysis of 218 trials found that exercise is an “effective
treatment  for  depression,”  often  comparable  to  antidepressant  medications  in  its  impact .  Aerobic
activities like walking or jogging, as well as mind-body exercises like yoga and tai chi, can significantly
reduce  depressive  symptoms,  particularly  when  done  with  moderate  to  high  intensity .  Beyond
mood disorders, regular exercise is linked to lower anxiety, sharper cognitive function, and reduced risk of
neurodegenerative diseases . It even literally grows the brain: aerobic fitness training has been
shown to increase hippocampal volume, the seat of memory, in older adults . In short,  “exercise is as
good for the brain as it is for the heart,”  as Walsh succinctly put it .
Proper rest and sleep  are equally non-negotiable. Sleep is the time when the body repairs and the mind
consolidates memories and emotional experiences. Chronically skimping on sleep not only impairs mood
and cognition – it also shortens the lifespan. A large body of epidemiological evidence indicates that both
insufficient  sleep  (typically  <7  hours  per  night)  and  excessively  long  sleep  are  associated  with  higher
mortality rates . A meta-analysis of 16 studies found that short sleepers had a 10% higher risk of all-4

cause death, while habitually long sleepers (often a sign of underlying illness) had an even higher risk (~23%
increase) . In terms of mental health, chronic sleep deprivation is a known risk factor for depression
and anxiety, and treating insomnia often yields improvements in mood disorders. Our circadian rhythms ,
honed under the rising and setting sun, expect regular periods of light, dark, and activity. Modern life’s
irregular schedules and abundant artificial light can disrupt those rhythms, contributing to problems like
insomnia, seasonal depression, and metabolic dysregulation. Thus, one first principle of well-being is to
honor the basic rhythm of activity and rest that our biology demands: exert the body regularly, but also give
it sufficient sleep and relaxation to recover .
Nutrition is another pillar . The adage “we are what we eat” carries literal truth for the brain, which consumes
about 20% of our energy intake and is highly sensitive to nutritional factors. Diet quality has now been
linked to mental health outcomes in a burgeoning field of “nutritional psychiatry.” Diets rich in whole foods
– vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, fish, nuts – appear protective, while diets heavy in ultra-
processed foods, refined sugars, and unhealthy fats are associated with higher risk of depression. In one
landmark randomized trial, increasing consumption of a Mediterranean-style diet  significantly alleviated
depression in adults, compared to a control group on their usual diet . A 2024 research review in
Nutrition  Reviews  similarly  concluded  that  people  advised  to  follow  a  Mediterranean  diet  experienced
“greater reduction in depression symptoms than those in control groups” . Nutrient-wise, omega-3 fatty
acids (from fish or flax), B-vitamins, and antioxidants are believed to support brain health, while excessive
junk food may trigger inflammation that can contribute to mood disturbances. It’s telling that Walsh’s
Therapeutic Lifestyles list includes “diet (a rainbow of fruits and vegetables plus fish oils)”  as one of the eight
evidence-backed factors for mental health . From an evolutionary view, our ancestors ate unprocessed,
high-fiber diets with sporadic meat; returning closer to that pattern – more plants, less sugar and additive-
laden fare – better aligns with what our bodies expect.
Nature and the Rhythm of Life
Humans evolved not in concrete jungles but in actual jungles (and savannas, forests, grasslands). Contact
with nature  is a subtle but powerful contributor to well-being. We often intuitively sense this – a walk in the
woods  or  an  hour  in  the  garden  just  “clears  the  head.”  Research  confirms  that  exposure  to  natural
environments can restore attention, lower stress hormones, and boost mood and immune function. One
review noted that  “the popular idea that spending time in nature clears the head is true”  – time outdoors
reliably  “improves emotional and spiritual well-being, enhances cognitive function, and reduces symptoms of
depression and ADHD” . Yet modern society increasingly keeps us  indoors , bathed in artificial light
and staring at screens, with what some call an epidemic of “nature-deficit disorder.”  The result is that many
people go days or weeks with minimal green exposure. Studies have found that even small interventions – a
20-minute walk in a park, or adding plants and window views of nature in workplaces – can reduce stress
and anxiety. More immersive experiences like wilderness hiking or gardening programs have documented
therapeutic effects for conditions like PTSD and depression. The biophilia hypothesis  in biology suggests
humans have an innate affinity for nature, a bond from millennia of living intimately with the earth’s cycles.
In our genes and lungs, we need fresh air , sunlight, the sounds of water and wind in leaves. Preserving
access to nature, as Walsh argues, is not only an environmental imperative but “a mental health imperative”
as well .
Alongside nature, we must consider stress and relaxation . Acute stress was a normal part of premodern
life – an animal attack, a sudden storm – but it was typically brief, with long recovery periods. Today, many
people  experience  chronic  stress :  a  continuous  drip  of  work  pressures,  financial  worries,  information1112

overload, and uncertainty. Chronic stress is corrosive. It contributes to anxiety, depression, insomnia, and a
host of “lifestyle diseases” via sustained cortisol exposure and inflammation. Therefore, any blueprint for
well-being includes learning to downshift  – to actively invoke the body’s relaxation response and give the
nervous system a break. Traditional societies did this through ritual, prayer , communal feasting, or siestas.
Modern  science  has  validated  a  number  of  techniques,  from  deep-breathing  exercises  and  yoga  to
biofeedback. But perhaps the most thoroughly researched relaxation practice is meditation . Indeed, Walsh
notes that “meditation is now the most extensively researched of all psychotherapies”  with thousands of studies
demonstrating  benefits  across  biological  and  psychological  domains .  Regular  mindfulness  or
contemplative practice can reduce anxiety, buffer against stress, improve concentration, and even cultivate
qualities like empathy and emotional resilience . Remarkably, meditation not only helps the individual
meditator – in clinical trials, therapists who meditate have better patient outcomes, suggesting it sharpens
the caregiver’s attunement and compassion . Beyond any specific method, the key is building rhythms
of rest  into life: moments of pause, reflection, and stillness that allow us to reset. Our ancestors had the
night fire and the rest day; we have mindfulness apps, music, or a quiet cup of tea. Different form, same
function.
The Deep Social Instinct: Connection and Belonging
No discussion of human well-being can avoid what may be the most potent source of all: other people . We
are an ultra-social species. Evolution shaped us to cooperate, care for kin, form friendships, and derive
strength from community. Isolation, in ancestral times, meant death; belonging meant safety. Little wonder ,
then, that loneliness registers in the brain much like physical pain, or that social rejection can break a heart
as surely as cardiac disease. Modern research has decisively shown that social relationships are not just a
luxury to make life pleasant – they are a necessity for health and happiness . One landmark meta-
analysis of 148 studies concluded that individuals with strong social ties have significantly greater odds of
survival over time than those with weak ties . The difference was startling:  “individuals with adequate
social relationships have a 50% greater likelihood of survival compared to those with poor or insufficient social
relationships,”  the authors reported – an effect on mortality “comparable with quitting smoking”  and stronger
than risk factors like obesity or lack of exercise . In terms of mental health, social support is a well-known
buffer against stress and a protective factor against depression. People who feel loved and supported
experience lower chronic stress hormone levels and more robust immune function. Conversely, chronic
loneliness has been linked to higher rates of mood disorders, cognitive decline, and even dementia.
Perhaps the most compelling evidence for the primacy of relationships comes from the Harvard Study of
Adult Development , an extraordinary 87-year longitudinal study tracking hundreds of individuals’ lives
from adolescence into old age. The current director of the study, psychiatrist Robert Waldinger , summarizes
its  findings  succinctly:  “The  clearest  message  is  this:  Good  relationships  keep  us  happier  and  healthier.
Period.” . Men (and later women and their offspring) in the study who had warm relationships with
family, friends, or community proved far more likely to live long, content lives than those who did not. Social
connections were a stronger predictor of late-life happiness than income, IQ, or genetic luck. As Waldinger
explained in a TED Talk, “people who are more socially connected to family, to friends, to community, are happier,
they are physically healthier, and they live longer than people who are less well connected” . Conversely,
loneliness turned out to be toxic . Those who were isolated experienced earlier health declines and reported
lower happiness. It is sobering that in many wealthy countries today, social isolation is on the rise – more
people live alone, report having no close confidant, or feel that others would not support them in a crisis
. Such trends have prompted some public health experts to label loneliness an epidemic and a
public health crisis in its own right.18

What constitutes a “good relationship” for well-being? It’s not about quantity of contacts or a perfect nuclear
family ideal. Key aspects seem to be emotional closeness, mutual support, and feeling understood or
accepted  by  others .  This  can  come  from  family,  close  friends,  a  romantic  partner ,  or  a  tightly  knit
community group – ideally, more than one of these. The point is not that everyone must be a social
butterfly; rather , we each need some circle of belonging . In Glasser’s terms, we need love and belonging to
be fulfilled; in SDT terms, we need relatedness satisfied. Evolution would agree: no hunter-gatherer could
survive  without  their  band.  In  modern  contexts,  “band”  might  mean  one’s  neighborhood,  religious
congregation, book club, or colleagues. Even caring for a pet provides some social nourishment (and
indeed,  studies  show  pet  owners  often  have  lower  stress  and  better  well-being).  Strong  relationships
provide a  sense of security  – knowing there are people to turn to in times of need. They also give us
opportunities to care for others, which brings its own rewards. In fact, one of Walsh’s eight TLCs is “service
to  others,”  highlighting  that  contributing  and  being  generous  can  elevate  our  well-being .  Acts  of
altruism trigger what psychologists call the “helper’s high,” a release of endorphins and oxytocin that create
feelings of warmth and connection. Remarkably, volunteerism and caregiving have been associated with
lower mortality rates as well, suggesting that in taking care of others, we also take care of ourselves.
In a sense, science is rediscovering an ancient truth. Philosophers from Aristotle to Confucius extolled
friendship and community as the core of a good life. Epicurus famously wrote,  “Of all the means which
wisdom gives us to ensure happiness, by far the most important is the acquisition of friends.”  Modern data
resoundingly affirm this old advice . Unfortunately, modern society presents new obstacles to social
connection.  Our  lifestyles  often  encourage  technological  connection  at  the  expense  of  face-to-face
presence . An American adult today might spend more time engaging with TV characters or social media
avatars than with their neighbors or even family. Paradoxically, despite 24/7 connectedness, many report
feeling  lonelier  than ever . Psychologists have identified “techno-pathologies” – conditions like “Facebook
depression” or anxiety from constant social comparison online . While technology itself isn’t evil, it
cannot replace the depth of in-person interaction. A text message empathy is not the same as a hug or a
friend’s shoulder . Recognizing this, some public health efforts and individual choices are aiming to rebuild
community  –  be  it  through  group  exercise  classes,  community  gardens,  co-housing  arrangements,  or
simply the ritual of a weekly family dinner with phones off. The first principle  is clear: to flourish, humans
need to nurture relationships . The forms can vary (friends, family, mentorship, love, teamwork), but the
function is non-negotiable. We are wired to connect, and when we do, we thrive.
Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose
While our social nature is paramount, human well-being also hinges on our individual agency and growth .
This is where needs for autonomy, competence, and meaning come into play. We are not only social
animals, but also curious, goal-seeking animals . We long to feel in control of our lives, to be capable at what
we do, and to pursue goals that matter .  Autonomy  – feeling that we have choice and self-direction – is
essential for mental health. People who believe they are the masters of their own fate (a high internal locus
of control) tend to cope better with stress and feel happier than those who feel controlled or helpless. This
need for autonomy is evident from toddlerhood (the stubborn “I do it myself” phase) to old age. Self-
Determination Theory has demonstrated across cultures that environments supporting autonomy – for
instance,  workplaces  that  give  employees  some  decision  latitude,  or  parents  who  allow  children  age-
appropriate choices – produce greater motivation and well-being . By contrast, highly controlling
environments breed passivity, rebellion, or depression. In Glasser’s Choice Theory, “freedom”  is one of the
five basic needs; without some sense of freedom, people become unhappy and unfulfilled . Even in
tightly  interdependent  societies,  individuals  need  domains  of  life  where  they  can  exercise  their  will  –23

whether it’s choosing one’s occupation, friends, or simply how to spend leisure time. The explosive desire
for political freedom in many parts of the world also underscores autonomy as a fundamental human
craving: the human spirit revolts against totalitarian control, even if material conditions under dictatorship
are stable. In everyday life, nurturing autonomy might mean setting personal goals, cultivating hobbies, or
establishing healthy boundaries in relationships – anything that reinforces the feeling “this is my life, and I
have a say in it.”
Closely tied to autonomy is the need for competence  or mastery. We derive deep satisfaction from learning,
improving, and accomplishing things . One can observe the glow of pride in a child who just learned to tie
their shoes, or the contentment of an elder who continues to hone a craft. Being effective in the world –
whether that world is as small as a kitchen or as large as a company – feeds our self-esteem and sense of
purpose. SDT identifies competence as core to well-being, and it’s supported by evidence: when people feel
skillful and efficacious, they experience more positive emotion and less anxiety . Glasser’s need for
“power”  is essentially about competence and achievement (not power over others, but the empowerment of
oneself through accomplishment) . Modern positive psychology also reflects this in the “A” of Martin
Seligman’s PERMA model – Accomplishment . We thrive when we have meaningful challenges  to work at and
occasional victories to savor . It’s telling that chronic unemployment is one of the most devastating things for
mental  health  –  not  only  due  to  financial  strain,  but  because  it  deprives  people  of  a  daily  arena  to
demonstrate competence and feel useful. Similarly, boredom and lack of stimulation can breed depression:
the mind, built to learn and engage, wilts without exercise just as the body does. This need for mastery
helps explain why hobbies and passions  can be so restorative – they offer bite-sized projects and creative
outlets that reward us with a sense of progress. It also sheds light on the importance of  play  (Glasser’s
“fun”). Play isn’t trivial; in play we experiment, we fail safely, we improve skills, and we enter a state of flow
that is linked to high well-being. Adults who continue to play – whether through sports, games, music, or art
– often report feeling more alive  than those who let all playfulness fade.
Finally, humans are meaning-makers. We have an uncanny ability to ask “why” – and we suffer when we
cannot find an answer . Purpose and meaning  are the capstones of the pyramid of needs. Ancient traditions
provided purpose through religion, spirituality, or communal goals. Today, many grapple with existential
questions in a secular world. Yet, research shows that having a sense of purpose – a reason to get up in the
morning beyond one’s own pleasure  – is profoundly tied to well-being. Purpose can come from many sources:
committing to a career that helps others, raising children, creating art, protecting one’s homeland, or simply
pursuing personal growth. The form is less important than the feeling that one’s life matters in a larger
context. Studies have linked a strong sense of purpose to better mental health, greater resilience, and even
longer life. In one longitudinal study of older adults, those who reported a clear purpose in life were less
likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease and had lower mortality rates than those who felt aimless. On a
societal level, cultures that emphasize collective goals and spiritual meaning often have lower rates of
suicide and depression, even amid hardship. For instance, communities that practice religions with strong
transcendent  purpose  or  that  follow  lifelong  philosophical  teachings  (like  Buddhism’s  path  to
enlightenment) give individuals frameworks that make suffering more bearable and goals more enduring.
Self-Determination Theory’s founders and others have argued that meaningfulness  might itself function like
a basic psychological need – when we feel our lives are meaningful, it satisfies something fundamental in us
. Conversely, meaninglessness – the “existential vacuum” Victor Frankl wrote about – can be crippling.
People who feel useless or without purpose (say, after retirement, or during a personal crisis) often slide
into poor mental and even physical health.30

It is noteworthy how purpose intertwines with other needs . Often, our sense of meaning comes from our
relationships and contributions. A parent finds purpose in caring for their child (relatedness, altruism); a
doctor finds it in healing patients (service, competence); an activist in fighting for freedom (autonomy,
justice). Even at a national level, countries that explicitly prioritize wellbeing and cultural values over pure
economic growth provide their citizens a shared sense of purpose. Take Bhutan, for example, which we’ll
discuss shortly – its policy of Gross National Happiness embeds the idea that being a good, compassionate
person and preserving culture and nature are part of one’s purpose as a citizen. This can counter the
aimlessness that pervades more consumption-driven societies. In sum, fulfilling our needs for autonomy,
mastery, and meaning  gives us individual grounding: a feeling that I have control, I can do things, and what
I do matters . Combined with social belonging and physical vitality, these elements complete the picture of
holistic well-being.
Lessons from Thriving Societies: Sweden, Bhutan, and Tibet
So far we have explored universal principles through the lens of biology and psychology. But how do these
play out in the real world, across different societies? One way to test our understanding is to look at
populations known for high levels of well-being or unique approaches to happiness – and see which factors
stand out. National and cultural contexts can powerfully shape how needs are met (or not met). Let us
consider three very different societies – Sweden, Bhutan, and traditional Tibetan culture  – often cited in
discussions of well-being. Each illustrates, in its own way, how structural and lifestyle variables align with (or
occasionally confound) the basic requirements of human flourishing.
Sweden , a modern Scandinavian welfare state, regularly ranks among the top in global happiness and
quality-of-life  indices.  On  the  surface,  Sweden  is  nothing  like  a  Paleolithic  tribe  –  it  is  a  wealthy,
technologically advanced nation of 10 million people. Yet many of its social conditions closely satisfy the
first principles we have outlined. For one, Sweden provides a high degree of basic security  to its citizens:
universal healthcare, free education, and a robust social safety net mean that people’s survival needs
(Glasser’s “survival” need) are well covered. Income inequality is relatively low and poverty rare, which helps
minimize the kind of chronic stress and status anxiety that plague unequal societies (indeed, studies have
found that greater income inequality is associated with higher prevalence of mental illness in rich societies ,
so Sweden’s egalitarian ethos likely buffers against this). Swedes also enjoy an enviable work-life balance .
Full-time workers typically get at least five weeks of paid vacation, and the culture strongly values leisure
and family time. It’s common for offices to empty out by 5 PM, and there is even a cherished daily ritual
called  fika –  a  social  coffee  break  to  connect  with  colleagues  or  friends.  Only  about  1%  of  Swedish
employees regularly work very long hours, one of the lowest rates in the OECD . All of this means people
have time : time to exercise, to sleep adequately, to socialize – essentially, time to live in accord with natural
rhythms and personal needs, rather than feeling constantly pressured.
Sweden’s environment further supports well-being. Despite long, dark winters, Swedes make the most of
sunlight and nature when they can. The country has expansive parks and a tradition of outdoor recreation
(skiing, hiking, foraging berries in summer). The concept of  allemansrätten , or “everyman’s right,” gives
everyone legal access to roam the countryside, camp, and enjoy nature. As a result, even city-dwellers often
have a strong connection to the outdoors. This addresses the nature need  we discussed – a kind of built-in
antidote to nature-deficit disorder . Social trust and community in Sweden are also notably high. In surveys,
over 90% of Swedes report that they have someone they could rely on in a time of need . This is a simple
but powerful metric of social support – and Sweden slightly outperforms the already high OECD average on
it .  A  strong  social  fabric,  combined  with  comprehensive  welfare,  means  that  very  few  people  fall32
33
34

through the cracks into extreme isolation or desperation. Indeed, the OECD’s Better Life Index praises
Sweden for “sustaining a high level of well-being of its citizens”  year after year . That sustained well-being is
reflected in outcomes: life expectancy in Sweden is about 82 years (two years above the OECD average) ,
and self-reported life satisfaction is 7.3 out of 10, among the highest in the world . Sweden is not a
utopia – it has its challenges, including a recent uptick in inequality and some reports of high youth anxiety
– but as a case study, it shows how a society that values balance, equality, community, and trust  creates
the conditions for humans to thrive. In essence, Sweden’s social contract fulfills many first principles: people
feel secure (basic needs met), free (ample personal time and autonomy), competent (excellent education
and a high-employment economy), connected (strong community and family policies), and even close to
nature (environmental quality is high, with low pollution and protected green spaces ). It’s a modern
template that echoes ancient instincts.
If Sweden represents a high-tech society maximizing well-being, Bhutan  offers a very different perspective
– that of a small developing nation explicitly centered on happiness as a goal. The Himalayan kingdom of
Bhutan famously measures its progress with  Gross National Happiness (GNH) , a comprehensive index
that treats well-being as a national priority on par with economic growth. Bhutan’s GNH framework is
rooted in its Buddhist heritage and includes nine domains: psychological well-being, health, education, time
use, cultural diversity, good governance, community vitality, ecological diversity, and living standards .
Each domain is weighted equally, reflecting the holistic view that material and non-material aspects of life
all contribute to happiness . What makes Bhutan intriguing is that it has sought to integrate many of the
“first principles” directly into policy. For instance, community vitality and cultural connection  are actively
preserved: Bhutanese society remains very communal, with strong family ties and village cooperatives, and
the  government  promotes  cultural  traditions  (from  national  dress  to  festivals)  that  foster  a  sense  of
belonging and identity. The ecological aspect  of GNH ensures that nature is protected – Bhutan is one of
the only carbon-negative countries in the world, with the constitution mandating at least 60% forest cover .
This means Bhutanese people live in a pristine environment, with clean air , clean water , and daily contact
with breathtaking natural landscapes – factors conducive to mental peace  (imagine the contrast to
inhabitants of polluted megacities). The time use  domain in GNH also emphasizes balance: it encourages
reasonable work hours and leisure, somewhat akin to work-life balance efforts in the West but framed as a
cultural norm of not being overly acquisitive or work-obsessed.
Health and education have improved markedly in Bhutan over the past decades, thanks in part to GNH-
influenced policies. Life expectancy, which was in the 40s in the mid-20th century, has jumped to the low
70s , essentially catching up to the global average . Mental health services remain limited in Bhutan
(as is common in low-income countries), but mental illness rates are reportedly lower than in many Western
nations. It’s hard to get precise statistics – and one must consider underreporting – but culturally, there is a
strong stigma against suicide and an emphasis on collective coping which may keep overt mental illness
rates down. For example, in WHO data around 2019, self-harm did not even register among the top causes
of death in Bhutan, whereas in wealthier countries like Australia it was a significant cause for young people
.  This  suggests  that  something  in  Bhutan’s  social  fabric  –  possibly  the  protective  effects  of  tight
community and spiritual outlook – is buffering against some extreme mental health outcomes. Bhutanese
culture,  infused  with  Mahayana  Buddhist  values,  teaches  that  happiness  is  achieved  through
contentment,  compassion,  and  detachment  from  excessive  desire .  The  idea  of  mindfulness  and
acceptance  of  suffering  is  built  into  daily  life  (prayer  flags,  meditation,  monastery  retreats).  As  one
Bhutanese  official  succinctly  put  it,  “The  happiness  we  have,  the  contentment  that  we  have  ...  must  be
sustainable”  – emphasizing resilience and balance over fleeting pleasure.35

Of course, Bhutan faces many challenges: poverty is still present in rural areas, and rapid modernization is
introducing new stresses (like youth unemployment or exposure to global consumer culture). The GNH
surveys themselves show that slightly less than half of Bhutanese qualify as “happy” by their metrics (48% in
the most recent index, up from 41% a decade prior) . So there is room to grow. But Bhutan’s experiment
underscores a vital lesson: when a society’s institutions align with human psychological needs, well-
being can improve even without high wealth . Bhutanese people have a strong sense of purpose  (one of
the GNH pillars is good governance – citizens take pride in their country’s unique path, and the monarchy
actively  cultivates  a  national  purpose  of  harmonious  development).  They  also  benefit  from  belonging
(multi-generational family living is common, and community rituals are frequent). And though materially
modest, Bhutan historically was isolated from the consumer rat race, which perhaps spared its people some
of  the  status  anxieties  that  afflict  more  competitive  economies.  In  short,  Bhutan  demonstrates  that
collective  ideals  of  compassion,  cultural  continuity,  and  environmental  harmony  can  create
structural supports for well-being . Its case also suggests that mental well-being can flourish in non-
material ways: by valuing the sacred, the social, and the scenic, even a poor country can nurture rich lives.
Our third case, Tibet , is not a nation-state (today Tibet is a region within China), but rather a cultural and
spiritual tradition that offers a window into extreme human flourishing of a different kind. When people talk
about “Tibet” and well-being, they often refer to the Tibetan monastic culture  and the Tibetan Buddhist
approach  to  the  mind.  Tibetan  monks  have  long  been  subjects  of  fascination  for  Western  scientists
interested  in  meditation  and  positive  mental  states.  In  the  early  2000s,  neuroscientists  like  Richard
Davidson began conducting brain imaging studies on Tibetan lamas and seasoned meditators, at the
encouragement of the Dalai Lama. The findings were striking: during compassion meditation, Tibetan
monks  showed  unprecedented  levels  of  high-frequency  brain  activity  (gamma  waves),  indicative  of
heightened  awareness  and  neural  synchrony,  far  beyond  what  is  seen  in  untrained  brains .
Functionally,  these  monks  reported  deep  states  of  bliss  and  altruistic  love.  One  monk  and  scientist,
Matthieu Ricard, was dubbed “the happiest man in the world” by popular media after his brain scans
showed extremely high activation in regions associated with positive emotion and a reduced inclination to
ruminate  on  negativity .  While  that  moniker  is  tongue-in-cheek,  it  highlights  that  the  Tibetan
Buddhist tradition has refined techniques of mental training (mindfulness, compassion cultivation, cognitive
reframing) that directly target some first principles of well-being – especially meaning, perspective, and
emotional balance.42

A  Tibetan  Buddhist  monk  radiating  a  genuine  smile.  In  traditional  Tibetan  culture,  values  like  compassion,
mindfulness, and contentment are cultivated from an early age, which can yield remarkable levels of resilient well-
being. Neuroscientists have found that long-term Tibetan meditators show unusually strong activation in brain
regions associated with positive emotions and compassion . The Dalai Lama often emphasizes that happiness
is not simply luck or luxury, but an inner practice  of training the mind toward kindness and realism.
Tibetan culture traditionally emphasizes that happiness is achieved by taming the mind and opening the
heart . The Dalai Lama has said “happiness is the highest form of health,”  implying that mental well-being is
foundational to all other aspects of health . In Tibetan Buddhist philosophy, negative emotions like
anger and grasping are seen as transient clouds obscuring the sky of the mind; through meditation and
ethical living, one can dissipate them and reveal the inner sky of luminous awareness (often described as a
state of peace or even bliss). This does not mean Tibetans never struggle – historically, Tibet was a poor
society  with  high  infant  mortality,  and  the  Tibetan  people  have  endured  enormous  trauma  since  the
mid-20th century under Chinese rule and during exile. Yet, observers have often remarked on the resilience
and comparative cheerfulness of Tibetan refugees. The Dalai Lama himself, despite losing his country and
living in exile for decades, remains a paragon of equanimity and hope. In his writings, he reveals some of
his mental strategies: “If the situation or problem can be remedied, then there is no need to worry about it… If
there is no solution, there is also no point in worrying” , he advises . This almost stoic acceptance,
combined with proactive compassion ( “if you are motivated by a wish to help others, you can carry on with less
fear or worry” ), shields the mind against despair . Tibetan monks cultivate an outlook that transforms
problems into spiritual opportunities, a mindset the Dalai Lama credits with helping his people “maintain
their dignity and spirit”  in the face of great adversity . 
What can we learn from Tibet? One takeaway is the power of mindset and meaning . Tibetan culture gives
individuals a framework that imbues even suffering with meaning (karma, spiritual growth) and prioritizes
compassion above self-centered pursuits. This appears to produce a high degree of emotional well-being
and pro-social behavior . In Western terms, it’s like a whole culture doing cognitive-behavioral therapy and
loving-kindness  meditation  as  part  of  daily  life  –  an  inoculation  against  certain  modern  maladies  like
nihilism or alienation. Research by psychologists on Tibetan monastics found that even their concept of self

is more flexible (less ego-rigid), which correlated with higher life satisfaction . Another lesson is the
importance of spiritual or existential needs . While not everyone will become a monk or adopt Buddhist
philosophy, people everywhere seek deeper meaning. Whether through religion, philosophy, or secular
humanism, having some guiding inner principle or faith  can significantly bolster well-being. It provides a
stable standpoint to navigate life’s ups and downs. Tibetans, with their profound faith in the Dharma,
illustrate how a shared spiritual vision  can foster individual happiness and communal resilience.
Synthesis: Toward a Universal Model of Well-Being
Across  these  diverse  explorations  –  from  the  lab  to  the  savanna,  from  Swedish  towns  to  Himalayan
monasteries – a coherent picture emerges. The first principles of human well-being  seem to crystallize into a
set  of  interlocking  needs  and  lifestyles  that,  when  met,  allow  the  human  organism  to  thrive.  We  can
summarize them as follows:
Physical Vitality:  A healthy body sustained by exercise, restorative sleep, and nutritious food. Our
biology still expects us to move vigorously, rest deeply, and consume natural foods. When we honor
those needs, we reap mental as well as physical rewards – from improved mood and energy to
longer life. Neglecting them (through sedentariness, chronic sleep loss, poor diet) saps well-being at
its roots.
Social Connection:  High-quality relationships are the greatest protector of health and happiness.
Humans need to feel they belong and are accepted – to love and be loved. Isolation is a poison;
community is medicine. Whether it’s family, friends, or a broader community, having people to share
joys and sorrows with is essential. As the Harvard study showed, embracing relationships keeps us
“happier and healthier”  into old age , and as epidemiology showed, it even keeps us alive .
Autonomy and Freedom:  We are not cogs in a machine; we suffer when entirely controlled. Having
freedom – in personal decisions, in political voice, in how we shape our day – is crucial for dignity
and  motivation.  Autonomy  feeds  our  sense  of  self  and  responsibility.  Societies  that  safeguard
personal freedoms (and support people’s agency, like Sweden’s flexible work policies) tend to have
happier citizens . Internally, an autonomous mindset – taking ownership of one’s choices – also
correlates with better mental health.
Mastery and Accomplishment:  A thriving human is one who keeps learning and growing. We need
to feel competent in our endeavors, be it work, hobbies, or life skills. Achievements boost our self-
esteem and provide positive feedback, while stagnation or persistent failure undermines confidence.
People report some of their greatest highs in “flow” states – those moments when one is deeply
engaged and performing well at a valued task. Designing environments that allow people to succeed
(schools that engage different talents, jobs that provide skill development) is thus a key to well-
being.
Meaning and Purpose:  Perhaps the most uniquely human need, and the hardest to measure, yet
unmistakably  important.  As  social  scientist  Viktor  Frankl  observed  in  survivors  of  concentration
camps, those who found meaning  in their struggle were far more resilient. We crave a sense that our
life is not arbitrary – that it fits into some larger narrative or serves something beyond the self.
Purpose connects our daily actions to a big picture. It also often involves service, creativity, or
devotion to a cause, which loops back to fulfilling other needs (relatedness, competence). Societies51

that offer their members a clear sense of collective purpose (whether it’s Bhutan’s GNH ethos or a
strong national identity) often see higher well-being and social cohesion. Individually, purpose can
be cultivated by reflecting on one’s core values and finding ways to align life with them – essentially
answering the “why” of one’s existence.
Security  and  Stability:  While  not  as  “uplifting”  as  meaning  or  love,  the  need  for  basic  safety
undergirds  everything.  Chronic  insecurity  –  be  it  due  to  violence,  extreme  poverty,  or  chaotic
environments – breeds toxic stress that precludes higher well-being. Our brains devote massive
resources to survival when threatened, leaving little room for joy or growth. Thus, a first principle is
that people need a  stable, safe environment  to flourish. This includes physical safety (low crime,
peace) and economic safety (not living in constant dread of destitution). It also includes health
security (access to healthcare) and a safe physical environment (clean air , water , and protection from
extreme climate). In the hierarchy of needs, security is foundational. Countries like Sweden excel
here with their social safety nets, and the payoff is visible in well-being metrics .
Natural Environment and Rhythms:  Finally, our discussion highlights that humans were never
meant  to  be  estranged  from  nature  or  from  natural  cycles.  We  need  daylight  and  darkness,
greenness and seasonal change, a break from man-made stimuli. A principle emerges of  biophilic
design : integrating nature into daily life – whether through urban parks, houseplants, or countryside
retreats – to nurture that dormant part of our psyche that is at home in the wild. Likewise, living in
sync with natural rhythms (sleeping at night, being active by day; working in bursts and resting in
between, as our ultradian rhythms dictate) keeps our internal clocks and hormones in balance.
Technologies and lifestyles that override these rhythms (24/7 work, blue-light screens at midnight,
etc.) should be approached with caution, as they tamper with age-old calibration of our bodies.
These principles are not independent; they form a system . They mutually reinforce each other . For instance,
regular exercise (physical vitality) often improves sleep and mood, which makes one more inclined to
socialize;  good  relationships  (social  connection)  provide  emotional  support  that  encourages  exploring
hobbies (mastery) and cushion stress, allowing one to sleep better and feel safer; having autonomy might
enable one to spend more time in nature or choose meaningful work, and so on. When multiple needs are
satisfied, they tend to amplify overall well-being in a kind of upward spiral. Conversely, needs deficits can
create vicious cycles – e.g. loneliness can lead to depression and poor sleep, which saps motivation to
exercise or socialize further , deepening isolation.
It is instructive to see how these factors show up at a national level . The World Happiness Reports, which
rank countries by life satisfaction, consistently find that about three-quarters of the variance between
countries can be explained by six key variables: income (GDP per capita), healthy life expectancy, social
support, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and trust (absence of corruption) . These map
closely to our principles: income and longevity reflect basic material security and health; social support is
relationships; freedom is autonomy; generosity is altruism/meaning; trust in society is a form of security
and community health. The happiest countries (often the Nordics like Sweden, Denmark, Finland) score
high on all these – they are prosperous enough to meet basic needs, but also egalitarian and trusting, with
strong social ties and freedom. Interestingly, beyond a certain point, more wealth doesn’t increase national
happiness  much  –  suggesting  that  once  material  security  is  achieved,  the  social  and  psychological
dimensions become the differentiators. Meanwhile, countries that struggle in the rankings often have
deficits in one or more of these areas (e.g., conflict undermining safety, corruption undermining trust,
unemployment undermining purpose and mastery, etc.).•

Finally, it’s worth noting what  doesn’t  appear essential in the long run: fame, luxury, endless leisure, or
other hedonistic tropes. Pleasure and positive emotions are certainly part of well-being (who doesn’t enjoy
good food or fun experiences?), but they are more like the frosting than the cake. A life of only pleasure
without purpose or connection tends to feel hollow – a phenomenon seen in studies that distinguish
hedonic  happiness  (lots  of  positive  feelings)  from  eudaimonic  happiness  (a  sense  of  meaning  and
actualization). The latter has stronger links to health and deep satisfaction. In a way, our first principles lean
toward the eudaimonic: they are about engaging with life, not just consuming it. They require effort –
exercising, maintaining relationships, pursuing goals – but this effort paradoxically yields more joy and
contentment than passive indulgence does.
Conclusion
Human well-being, as complex as it is, comes down to surprisingly simple truths . We are animals who need
to move, sleep, and eat well. We are social beings who need each other’s presence, care, and support. We
are minds that need freedom to explore, skills to hone, and a purpose to fulfill. We are part of nature, and
need to feel that connection. And we are meaning-seekers, calmed by a sense of belonging to something
greater than ourselves. These are the bedrock requirements that evolution ingrained in us. When they are
met, we tend to flourish; when they are chronically unmet, we languish or break down.
Modern science has essentially validated age-old wisdom on these points. A wealthy aristocrat in ancient
Rome (Juvenal) prayed for  “mens sana in corpore sano”  – a healthy mind in a healthy body – and today’s
medical journals echo that sentiment, showing exercise and diet can prevent depression as much as any pill
. Great spiritual teachers from Buddha to Jesus emphasized love, compassion, and community;
contemporary longitudinal studies find that love and good relationships keep us alive and well .
Philosophers spoke of virtue and purpose; psychologists now find that serving others and having a mission
in life buffers against despair . The convergence is real. 
Of course, knowing these principles is one thing; living by them, as individuals and societies, is another . The
barriers in the modern world are significant – economic pressures, digital distractions, urban alienation,
inequalities, and more. Re-aligning with our first principles may require deliberate choices and cultural
shifts. It could mean redesigning cities to have more green spaces and communal areas (to facilitate nature
and social connection), reforming work norms to allow more free time and autonomy, prioritizing mental
health  and  education  that  teaches  relationship  skills  and  emotional  resilience,  and  recognizing  that
progress must ultimately be measured in human terms – health, happiness, fulfillment – not just in
dollars or gadgets .
The cases of Sweden, Bhutan, and Tibet illustrate that different paths can lead to satisfying the core human
needs. A high-tech generous welfare society, a small spiritual kingdom, and an introspective monastic
culture all converge on similar fundamentals: balance, connection, purpose, and compassion. Policymakers
might take note that emphasizing these “soft” variables yields hard benefits – lower healthcare costs,
greater societal cohesion, longer lives. But beyond policy, each of us in our personal lives can strive to align
with these principles. We can ensure we take care of our bodies, reach out to others, set meaningful goals,
and take time to appreciate the natural and spiritual aspects of living.
In a famous study, when dying people were asked what they regretted or would do differently, common
themes were: “I wish I had spent more time with loved ones,” “I wish I hadn’t worked so hard,” “I wish I had
let  myself  be  happier  and  stayed  true  to  myself.”  These  laments  neatly  correspond  to  our  topics  –97

relationships, work-life balance, and authenticity (autonomy and fun). It’s telling that at the end of life,
clarity emerges about what was truly valuable. The first principles of well-being are, in a sense, what people
realize too late that they should have prioritized all along.
The opportunity before us, with the aid of science and hindsight, is to prioritize them now . The evidence is
in, from fMRI labs to epidemiology: a fulfilling human life is one that is  socially rich, physically active,
mentally autonomous, competently skilled, and meaningfully engaged . Technology will advance and
societies will change in unforeseen ways, but these fundamental needs are unlikely to change – they are
part of our evolutionary design. As Robert Sapolsky (whose work blends biology and humanism) might
narrate, we can imagine a future where we use our big brains not just to invent new stimuli, but to engineer
environments that fit our Stone Age hearts. We can create workplaces that feel like supportive tribes,
schools that let children play and explore, cities that mimic the beauty of natural havens, and economies
that value well-being as much as productivity.
In the end, the “good life”  is not a mystery. It is a life where our basic human nature is nourished. We need
not puzzle over what happiness is – we can observe it in a family dinner full of laughter , in a group of friends
hiking up a mountain, in a skilled artisan absorbed in craft, in a volunteer’s gentle act of helping, or in a
monk’s serene smile. These are the scenarios that have always lit up the human spirit. They are as relevant
in 2025 as they were millennia ago. Grounded in our first principles, we can all take steps – individually and
collectively – to design lives that give us more of those moments. In doing so, we honor both our ancient
heritage and our highest aspirations, moving closer to the perennial goal that has driven humans across
time: to live well and flourish  in the deepest sense of the word.
