Blockchain and the State: Functions,
Opportunities, and Constraints
Introduction
Modern governments fulfill several core functions that underpin societal trust and order . These include
maintaining  authoritative  records  (e.g.  land  titles,  identity  registries),  coordinating  collective  decision-
making (e.g. elections and lawmaking), and allocating or regulating scarce privileges (e.g. issuing money,
granting spectrum licenses, managing carbon quotas). As blockchain technology promises tamper-evident
ledgers, decentralized consensus, and programmable transactions , a critical question is how these
affordances  might  replicate, complement, or constrain  traditional state roles. This report analyzes the
primary functions of government in theory and practice, and evaluates blockchain’s potential to  replace , 
augment , or limit  the state’s monopoly in each domain. We draw on case studies from the US, EU, and UK –
from land registries in Sweden and Georgia  to digital identity under EU eIDAS , CBDC pilots , Wyoming’s
DAO law , and  supply-chain platforms like TradeLens  – to illustrate real-world experiments. We also
compare major blockchain platforms (Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Cosmos, etc.) and their suitability for
“civic” applications. The analysis takes a globally comparative perspective (with emphasis on US, EU, and UK)
and provides a realistic appraisal of where blockchains could credibly substitute for governmental roles in
the near- to medium-term. 
Government’s Core Functional Domains and Blockchain
Affordances
1. Notarization of Facts: Records, Registries, and Proof of Ownership
One foundational role of government is to notarize facts  – certifying and storing authoritative records of
identity,  property,  contracts,  vital  statistics,  and  other  legal  rights.  Public  registries  (land  cadastres,
corporate registries, birth certificates, etc.) provide a single source of truth  backed by the state’s authority.
The government, in effect, serves as a trusted notary and record-keeper , ensuring records are accurate and
protecting  them  from  tampering  or  fraud.  This  centralized  system  has  strengths  (legal  finality,  clear
custody) but also weaknesses: records may be siloed, prone to bureaucratic delay or corruption, and rely on
fallible human procedures.
Blockchain’s Affordances – Auditability & Immutability:  Blockchain ledgers offer immutable, append-
only  record-keeping  where  each  entry  is  time-stamped  and  cryptographically  secured.  This  creates  a
tamper-evident  log  of  transactions  or  data  updates,  potentially  providing  the  same  assurance  of
authenticity that a government notary would. As one blockchain expert noted, “the best way to think about
this technology is that it’s like a global notary” . A blockchain-based registry can be  audited by any
participant  – every change is transparent and verifiable – which could reduce fraud and errors. In theory,
once a property deed or birth record is recorded on an immutable ledger , it cannot be altered or back-dated
without detection. This inherent integrity is especially attractive in contexts where trust in government is1
1
low or corruption is a problem , since an immutable public ledger can embed trust in technology rather
than in fallible institutions .
Replace, Complement, or Constrain?  To what extent can blockchain replace the state’s notary function? In
a replacement  scenario, a decentralized ledger could serve as the primary record of, say, land ownership –
independent of a central authority. In practice, full replacement is rare and challenging: while a blockchain
can record proof of ownership , enforcement of those rights (ejecting a squatter , adjudicating disputes) still
requires  state  power  (police,  courts).  Complementary  models  are  more  common:  governments  can
leverage blockchain for added security and efficiency  in their registries, while still providing the legal
and institutional framework around the data. For example, a government land office might record title
transfers on a distributed ledger to create an indelible audit trail (complementing the official registry). In
doing  so,  the  state  remains  the  ultimate  guarantor  of  property  rights,  but  blockchain  acts  as  a
technological check  – constraining officials from altering records unilaterally or increasing transparency
to deter corruption. In this sense, blockchain can  constrain  malfeasance by  locking in an immutable
history  of official records. However , the state’s monopoly is only partially constrained: a dishonest official
cannot secretly erase a title if the blockchain is public, but the legal system still governs how that record is
used or when it’s considered valid.
Real-world Examples:  Several governments have piloted blockchain in notary/registry functions, especially
for land records . Sweden’s land registry (Lantmäteriet)  conducted a multi-year pilot (2016–2018) using a
private  blockchain  to  record  property  transactions .  In  this  system,  authorized  parties  (land
authority, banks, buyers/sellers)  ran nodes on a blockchain network; each step of a property sale (from
signing a contract to registering title) was logged and visible to all participants in near-real time . The
pilot showed that blockchain can drastically speed up property deals  – reducing the time from signing to
registration from months to days  by automating verification and eliminating paper-based processes .
Lantmäteriet estimated such a system could save Swedish taxpayers over €100 million annually, thanks to
faster transactions, better data redundancy, and enhanced security . Notably, Sweden’s implementation
used a  permissioned blockchain  (access restricted to vetted entities) rather than a fully public chain –
reflecting a design choice to balance openness with privacy and control. While successful as a proof of
concept, officials acknowledged that scaling to nationwide use would require resolving  governance and
legal  questions  (e.g.  how  to  legally  recognize  the  digital  ledger  records) .  As  of  the  pilot’s
conclusion, the technology was promising but not yet a replacement for the official land register .
Perhaps the most cited success in this domain is  Georgia’s land registry . In 2016–2017, the Republic of
Georgia partnered with Bitfury to integrate blockchain into its national land titling system . The
approach Georgia took is instructive: they used a hybrid model  where a private permissioned blockchain
manages the land registry’s internal records, and cryptographic hashes of those records are anchored to
the  Bitcoin  public  blockchain .  This  means  that  while  the  Georgian  government  still  controls  the
primary database of land titles, every title deed or transaction is hashed and the hash is stored in a Bitcoin
transaction – providing an immutable, timestamped proof of the record’s existence that no one (not even
the government) can falsify . By 2017, Georgia had recorded over 100,000 land title documents  to the
blockchain in this way . The benefit is twofold: Georgian citizens gain confidence that their property
records are secure and verifiable  (no bureaucrat can back-date a sale or alter the ledger without detection
), and the land agency gains a robust backup and audit trail. This complements  the government’s role –
the  state  still  handles  registrations  and  disputes,  but  blockchain  provides  independent  verification ,
effectively constraining any insider tampering . Georgia’s example has been hailed as a model for other
countries with historical issues in land administration:  “A secure property registry built on blockchain can23

secure  billions  of  dollars  in  assets…  by  addressing  the  rapidly  growing  demand  for  transparency  and
accountability,”  Bitfury noted of the project . Indeed, the initiative was partly inspired by economist
Hernando de Soto’s push to strengthen property rights in emerging economies . It illustrates that
blockchain can substitute for some functions of a notary (providing proof of integrity) while still
relying on the state for legal enforcement . 
Beyond  land,  governments  have  explored  blockchain  for  notarizing  myriad  records :  birth  and  death
certificates, business licenses, educational certificates, and more. For instance, academic credentials  can
be issued as verifiable digital records on a blockchain, making it easier for employers or other schools to
trust their authenticity. In this vein, the European Union  via its European Blockchain Services Infrastructure
(EBSI)  is developing a verifiable credentials framework  aligned with the upcoming eIDAS 2.0 regulation. In
this model, universities or governments issue tamper-proof digital diplomas or ID attributes to citizens,
which  are  then  cryptographically  signed  and  registered  on  a  blockchain  for  verification .  The
blockchain  acts  as  an  immutable  registry  of  trusted  issuers  (e.g.  accredited  universities  or  civil
registries)  and their public keys, so that anyone verifying a credential can check the issuer’s signature
against the ledger . Importantly, the EU’s design does  not put personal data on-chain (to comply with
privacy laws); only  proofs and issuer attestations are recorded . This  complements government
digital ID systems  by adding a layer of cryptographic trust and cross-border interoperability – effectively
extending the notary function of the state into the digital realm  with greater auditability. Under the
new eIDAS framework, EU member states will likely act as  “Qualified Trust Service Providers”  issuing
verifiable credentials (e.g. a government could issue a digital ID credential or a driving license credential),
and  the  blockchain-based  system  will  ensure  these  credentials  are  universally  verifiable  across
jurisdictions . This can be seen as blockchain augmenting  the state’s notary role (making it more robust and
cross-compatible) rather than replacing it. It also shows how blockchains can  constrain  states indirectly:
once  a  credential  is  issued  and  anchored  on  a  public  ledger ,  it’s  much  harder  for  any  authority  to
retroactively invalidate or doctor it without leaving evidence. 
Limitations:  Despite these successes, blockchain is not a cure-all for registries. Garbage in, garbage out
still applies: a blockchain can prove a document hasn’t been altered, but it cannot guarantee the document
was correct or honestly issued in the first place. Human error or fraud at the input stage (e.g. registering a
fake land deed) will be perpetually memorialized. Moreover , the “oracle problem”  means that linking real-
world assets to blockchains is tricky – you always need a trusted source to confirm ground truth (for
example, a surveyor or registrar must confirm that Person A indeed sold Parcel X to Person B). Blockchains
also introduce new costs and complexities (node infrastructure, digital key management for users, etc.).
Governments have to decide on governance of the ledger  (who runs the nodes, how updates to code are
handled, how to recover from mistakes). These issues have slowed full adoption. In the  Swedish pilot ,
officials noted the need to resolve governance questions before going live . In short, blockchains can
enhance the integrity and efficiency of public records  and even substitute for some notary functions,
but they work best in tandem with legal systems. The state’s role as guarantor of last resort  (backing the
data with force of law) remains crucial, although the technology can lock in honesty  and shine a light on
malfeasance , thereby constraining  any abuse of the state’s custodial power over important records.
2. Synchronization of Collective Decisions: Elections and Legislative Processes
Another core domain of government is to facilitate collective decision-making  – that is, to aggregate the
will of the people or their representatives into actionable decisions. This includes  conducting elections
(from national votes to local referenda) and managing legislative or deliberative processes in councils and11
712

parliaments.  These  processes  require  fairness,  transparency,  and  acceptance  of  outcomes ,  which
traditionally rests on trusted procedures (e.g. secret ballots, supervised vote counts, official gazettes for
publishing laws). The state monopolizes this coordination role to ensure a single, legitimate result (e.g. who
won  an  election,  what  law  is  in  effect).  Failures  in  this  domain  –  whether  fraud  in  voting  or  lack  of
transparency in lawmaking – can undermine democratic legitimacy.
Blockchain’s Affordances – Decentralized Consensus & Transparency:  Blockchains inherently achieve
consensus  among distributed participants on the state of a ledger . Applied to voting or decision records,
this could mean that no single authority can falsify the outcome  – a majority of the network must agree
on the result. A blockchain-based voting system, for instance, can provide an open, auditable trail of votes
without  revealing  individual  votes  (if  designed  with  cryptographic  anonymization).  The  immutability  of
blockchain can ensure that once a vote is cast, it cannot be altered or deleted, and results are verifiable
end-to-end . Blockchain can also enable new forms of “digital governance” such as  smart contracts  that
automatically execute a collective decision (for example, releasing funds if a quorum approves a proposal).
The idea of a  “decentralized autonomous organization” (DAO)  exemplifies an attempt to synchronize
collective decisions via code: stakeholders vote with tokens, and the outcome (encoded in a smart contract)
directly triggers changes, with no central intermediary. In theory, this could be applied in civic contexts –
e.g.  a  local  community  DAO  voting  on  budget  allocations,  where  funds  are  automatically  disbursed
according to the blockchain vote result.
Replace, Complement, or Constrain? Replacing  core democratic processes with blockchain is ambitious
and controversial. One could imagine a fully blockchain-based election  where votes are cast on a public
ledger  rather  than  via  government-run  ballot  boxes  –  in  effect,  the  network  counts  the  votes,  not  a
government agency. This has appeal in terms of removing single points of failure or trust : no election
commission official or corrupt insider could secretly manipulate the count, because the tally is computed by
decentralized nodes and is fully transparent. However , practical and security challenges abound (discussed
below). More plausible in the near term are  complementary  uses: blockchain can  complement election
infrastructure  by providing an added layer of verifiability. For example, after a traditional paper-ballot
election, the results from each polling station could be hashed and posted to a public blockchain. This
would audit-proof the results  – any later change in the official results could be detected by comparing to
the blockchain record (which is timestamped and immutable). Such approaches have been piloted in some
locales  to  increase  trust  in  announced  outcomes.  Another  complementary  use  is  in  proxy  voting  or
smaller-scale decision processes : e.g. a city could use a permissioned ledger to let citizens vote on local
issues online, with each vote recorded immutably, while still having the city clerks verify eligibility off-chain.
Blockchain can also constrain governments  by enabling parallel  methods of decision-making outside state
control. The rise of online communities or activist DAOs illustrates this – groups can organize votes among
themselves  (say,  on  funding  public  goods  or  coordinating  protests)  using  blockchain  tools,  which  the
government cannot easily censor or manipulate. In authoritarian contexts, this could potentially constrain
the state by creating a  tamper-resistant record of collective sentiment  (though such use is nascent).
Additionally, if a government knows that citizens can verify results via an independent blockchain record, it
is constrained from misreporting or altering those results without detection.
Real-world Examples:  The most direct experiments with blockchain in collective decision-making have
been in  voting systems . In 2018,  West Virginia (USA)  ran a landmark pilot allowing overseas military
voters from several counties to vote in a midterm election via a blockchain-based mobile app . The
app, provided by Voatz, recorded encrypted ballots and then anchored the votes on a blockchain ledger14
4
for the state to count. Only a small number of voters participated (dozens), but it was the first federal
election test of blockchain voting in the US . Voters used biometrics on their phone to authenticate,
cast their ballot, and could later verify that their vote was recorded on the blockchain . From the user’s
perspective, this promised greater accessibility (they could vote from anywhere via phone) and confidence
that their vote wasn’t lost in the mail or miscounted . Indeed, deployed military often have to sacrifice
ballot secrecy by emailing or faxing ballots – the blockchain system restored secrecy while also providing a
real-time digital receipt . West Virginia’s Secretary of State noted the goal was to see if the tech could
improve participation for those who can’t easily vote in person . In terms of results, the pilot was
considered successful in usability –  “pretty slick!”  was the first soldier-voter’s verdict  – and it modestly
increased turnout among eligible overseas voters in the trial counties . 
However , this experiment also highlighted concerns. Security researchers later identified vulnerabilities in
the Voatz app, and  expert opinion remains sharply skeptical of internet voting via blockchain .
Renowned cryptographers argue that while blockchain can make vote tallying transparent, it does not solve
problems of malware on voters’ devices, server penetration, or voter coercion , and that the addition of
blockchain might introduce new attack surfaces. The  synchronization of collective choice is uniquely
sensitive : anonymity must be preserved (to prevent coercion) while ensuring one-person-one-vote and
resisting cyberattacks – a very high bar . In West Virginia’s case, after security audits, the state paused
further blockchain voting deployments. This underscores that fully replacing state-run elections with a
decentralized system is not yet practical  given security and trust issues. That said, smaller-scale uses
continue.  For  example,  the  Swiss  city  of  Zug  (known  for  its  “Crypto  Valley”)  conducted  a  test  of  a
blockchain-based  municipal  vote  in  2018  (for  a  consultative  poll),  and  Estonia  –  famed  for  digital
governance – has explored blockchain for maintaining integrity  of its already-digital voting system (Estonia’s
i-voting  logs  are  hashed  to  a  ledger  for  audit).  These  cases  treat  blockchain  as  a  complementary
safeguard  rather than the primary voting mechanism.
Beyond elections, consider legislation and public administration . Blockchain could enable novel forms of
“smart  legislation”  –  laws  or  regulations  encoded  as  smart  contracts  that  execute  automatically.  For
instance, a environmental regulation could be implemented as a smart contract that automatically fines
factories  (by  deducting  tokens)  if  pollution  sensors  report  emissions  above  a  limit.  This  kind  of
programmable  law  could  constrain  discretionary  enforcement  (everyone  knows  the  rule  will  trigger
objectively)  and  improve  compliance.  However ,  real  legal  systems  are  too  complex  and  value  human
judgment, so this remains largely theoretical or limited to narrow cases (like  algorithmic allocation of
budgets or benefits  under pre-defined rules). There is also an emerging concept of “GovTech”  platforms
where citizen input is recorded via blockchain for policy-making (e.g. liquid democracy  platforms that track
delegate votes on-chain). These aim to make the legislative process more transparent or participatory, but
they are experimental. 
One  tangible  development  is  how  governments  respond  to  DAOs  –  decentralized  autonomous
organizations that operate by member votes on blockchain, often managing real assets or funds. DAOs
represent a  new mode of collective governance  that exists independently of nation-states (some call it
“borderless governance” ). While not a replacement for public government, the rise of DAOs has prompted
jurisdictions like the US state of Wyoming to integrate them legally (discussed in the case studies below). By
recognizing  DAOs  as  legal  entities,  governments  are  effectively  acknowledging  an  alternative  form  of
organizing  collective  decisions  (for  co-ops,  companies,  communities)  that  is  mediated  by  blockchain
consensus  rather  than  by  state  law  alone.  In  the  long  run,  widespread  use  of  such  structures  could1415

21
22
23
5
constrain  traditional  governance  by  offering  people  new  ways  to  coordinate  and  self-govern  (for
example, community DAOs managing local resources with limited state oversight).
Limitations:  The limits of blockchain in collective decisions  are as much social and political as technical.
Even if one solves the cryptography of a secure voting ledger , the trust in the system’s setup  (who wrote
the code? who runs the nodes?) and the final mile  (proving a voter’s identity, preventing vote buying, etc.)
are non-trivial. Also, a blockchain cannot compel losers of a vote to accept the outcome – that still requires
institutional legitimacy. In legislatures, while blockchain could record votes of lawmakers immutably, the
negotiation  and  deliberation  processes  aren’t  easily  captured  on  a  ledger .  For  now,  blockchain’s  main
contribution is likely in  increasing transparency and auditability  (e.g. immutable logs of proceedings,
public identities of decision-makers recorded, smart contracts for enforcing procedural rules). These help
complement  governance  by  shining  light  on  processes  and  potentially  constrain  behind-the-scenes
alterations, but they do not remove the need for trust in actors and institutions. As one report noted,
despite interest in blockchain for voting,  “considerable skepticism [persists] about whether blockchain is the
right technology to accomplish online voting — or whether online voting is the right way to go at all” . Thus, in
the near term we expect to see blockchain as a tool for transparency in decisions (audit trails, open
data)  more  than  as  a  wholesale  platform  for  conducting  large-scale  public  votes  or  passing  laws
autonomously.
3. Allocation of Scarce Privileges: Money, Licenses, and Quotas
A third critical function of governments is the allocation of scarce resources or privileges  that are subject
to public policy. This includes monetary issuance  (central banks issuing fiat currency and controlling the
money supply), distributing spectrum licenses for wireless communications, permits for resource extraction,
quotas for carbon emissions or fisheries, and more. Such allocations often have  economic value and
require authority  – the government’s role is to ensure fairness, prevent conflict, and align distribution with
policy goals (e.g. auctioning spectrum for efficient use, issuing currency to stabilize the economy). The
state’s monopoly in these areas is sometimes explicit (only the central bank can create legal tender) or
effectively so (only regulators can grant broadcast licenses or pollution credits). Mismanagement or abuse
(over-issuing money leading to inflation, corrupt license awards) can have large societal costs, so there is
perennial interest in mechanisms that impose discipline or transparency on these allocation processes.
Blockchain’s Affordances – Decentralization, Tokenization & Programmability:  Blockchain technology
directly emerged in this domain with Bitcoin’s invention (2009)  – a decentralized currency not issued by
any state. Cryptocurrencies demonstrated that a network of nodes could enforce  scarcity of a digital
token  through consensus rules, without needing a central issuer . This directly challenges the monopoly of
governments over money. Beyond currency, blockchains enable tokenization of assets or rights  – creating
digital tokens that represent ownership or usage rights (which could correspond to licenses or quotas).
These tokens can be  programmed with rules  (smart contracts) and traded in transparent markets. For
example, a blockchain could host a  spectrum license exchange  where rights to radio frequencies are
represented as tokens that can be auctioned or traded in real-time, with all transactions logged immutably.
Similarly, carbon credits  or fishing quotas  could be issued as tokens that are traceable and have built-in
compliance checks (e.g. automatically retiring a token when used). The auditability  of blockchain means
every  issuance  and  transfer  of  a  privilege  can  be  tracked,  reducing  corruption  or  double-allocations.
Decentralized consensus  means the rules (like a cap on total tokens) can be enforced by code, preventing
any single actor from unilaterally changing the supply or giving someone special favor – in other words,
immutability and consensus can enforce scarcity and rules  even against government wishes.23

Replace,  Complement,  or  Constrain?  In  the  monetary  realm,  blockchain-based  cryptocurrencies  like
Bitcoin and Ethereum are often framed as  replacements  or alternatives to sovereign money. In practice,
while crypto adoption is growing, no major economy has replaced its national currency with a blockchain
currency (El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 is a notable experiment, though the US
dollar remains in parallel use). Where blockchain has arguably  constrained  governments is by  creating
competitive pressures : central banks see the popularity of Bitcoin, stablecoins, and other crypto assets as
pushing  them  to  innovate  (hence  the  rush  to  explore  Central  Bank  Digital  Currencies,  or  CBDCs).
Cryptocurrencies, being non-state money , also constrain monetary authorities by offering an escape valve
– if a government inflates its currency or imposes capital controls, citizens can potentially turn to crypto as
an alternative store of value or means of transfer . Indeed, the motivation behind some CBDC projects is
explicitly to “fend off the threat to [central banks’] money-printing powers from Bitcoin and Big Tech firms” . In
that sense, blockchain has already curtailed the absolute monopoly governments had on digital money by
proving a viable alternative channel.
More directly, many governments are looking to  complement  or modernize their issuance functions with
blockchain. A leading example is the development of Central Bank Digital Currencies : these are essentially
fiat  currencies  implemented  using  digital  ledger  technology  (not  always  blockchain  per  se,  but  often
inspired by it). A CBDC  can be thought of as the central bank issuing a tokenized form of national currency
that might circulate on a controlled ledger . The motivations include improving payment efficiency, financial
inclusion, and keeping control over digital payments that might otherwise shift to private cryptos. As of
2025, over 130 countries are exploring CBDCs  and dozens are in pilot or development stages . For
instance, the  European Central Bank (ECB)  is on track with a  digital euro pilot , aiming for a possible
launch around 2028 . The  Bank of England  has been researching a “digital pound,” which could be
introduced  later  this  decade .  The  United  States,  while  slower  on  a  retail  CBDC,  has  conducted
experiments like the MIT-Federal Reserve Project Hamilton  (which prototyped a high-speed digital dollar
ledger) and Project Cedar  at the New York Fed (which tested a wholesale CBDC for interbank transfers). As
of mid-2023, U.S. efforts focus on wholesale use (bank-to-bank settlements), with any consumer-facing
digital  dollar  still  in  research  –  one  report  noted  U.S.  progress  on  retail  CBDC  has  “stalled”  pending
legislative direction . These CBDC projects are complementary  in the sense that they use blockchain/DLT-
inspired designs to  enhance the state’s existing role  in money (making it more technologically up-to-
date), rather than ceding that role. A CBDC can be built on a permissioned blockchain run by the central
bank and selected nodes  (for example, commercial banks might run validating nodes). This could ensure
auditability  and programmability  (e.g. money with conditions or automated compliance), but keeps the
central bank firmly in control of supply and rules. In short, CBDCs are a case where governments are
borrowing the innovations of blockchain (distributed trust, tokenization)  to reinforce their monetary
sovereignty , effectively countering  the potential replacement of fiat by crypto. 
Other scarce privileges show a mix of replacement and complement. Spectrum licenses : There have been
conceptual proposals and some trials for managing spectrum via blockchain – for example, the U.S. Federal
Communications  Commission  and  other  telecom  regulators  have  discussed  dynamic  spectrum  access
systems, where devices could automatically acquire frequency leases via a blockchain-based exchange. This
could complement  the current licensing regime by adding a real-time market and potentially enforce rules
like  one  device  cannot  double-spend  a  spectrum  token,  etc.  However ,  widespread  deployment  hasn’t
occurred yet; spectrum auctions remain centrally run (though one could imagine running an auction on a
blockchain for transparency). 24

Environmental and tradeable permits  is an area with active pilots. Carbon credit registries  are being put
on blockchains in various initiatives, to improve transparency and prevent double counting of emissions
reductions. For example, IBM and other companies launched  blockchain platforms for carbon asset
trading , ensuring each credit (token) is unique and retired once used. Some countries’ environmental
agencies are experimenting with issuing tokens for renewable energy certificates or carbon offsets, which
can  then  be  tracked  across  borders.  This  doesn’t  replace  the  government’s  role  in  setting  the  cap  or
validating  projects,  but  it  complements  and  constrains  by  making  the  market  more  transparent  and
automating  compliance  (a  smart  contract  can  automatically  invalidate  a  credit  token  after  one  use,
preventing scams). 
In the  realm of corporate and financial licenses , consider that companies traditionally get charters or
licenses from governments (for banking, for example). There are now blockchain-native alternatives like
DAO  treasuries  and  DeFi  lending  platforms  that  replicate  some  functions  of  licensed  banks  (taking
deposits, making loans) without formal licenses, raising the question of constraint on regulatory regimes.
Governments are responding by updating laws (as with Wyoming’s DAO law, giving some legal status to
such organizations rather than leaving them entirely in gray zone). 
Cryptocurrencies  &  Stablecoins  as  Constraints:  A  particularly  vivid  way  blockchain  constrains  state
privilege is via stablecoins  – privately issued digital tokens pegged to fiat currency (like USD). Stablecoins
(e.g. USDC, Tether) now facilitate billions in daily transactions, effectively providing a parallel payments
system outside traditional banking, yet denominated in sovereign currency. They grew to fill demand for
fast, borderless dollar transactions (especially in crypto markets and emerging economies with volatile
currencies).  This  forced  regulators  to  pay  attention  –  concerns  that  unregulated  stablecoins  could
undermine financial stability or monetary policy have led to debates on how to oversee or integrate them.
In short, blockchain-based money and tokens have broken the state’s exclusive hold on issuing and
moving value , which in turn is pressuring states to adapt . As Reuters observed, all G20 countries (bar one)
are now in advanced exploration of CBDC, a dramatic leap from just a few years prior , precisely
because no major economy wants to be left without a sovereign footing in the digital currency space.
Real-world  Cases:  We  will  delve  into  specific  case  studies  like  CBDC  pilots  (in  the  next  section)  and
Wyoming’s DAO law . But to mention a few: China’s e-CNY  (digital yuan) is the world’s largest CBDC pilot,
reaching over 260 million people in pilot cities, though that’s outside our US/EU/UK focus.  Sweden’s e-
krona  pilot is one of Europe’s first – Riksbank built a proof-of-concept DLT system (with R3 Corda) for an e-
krona aimed at supplementing cash usage; this is ongoing with tests for retail use . In the UK, while no
pilot is live, the Bank of England issued discussion papers and the Chancellor indicated a digital pound
(dubbed “Britcoin” in media) is likely needed in coming years . The European Central Bank  has finished
prototyping  a  digital  euro  with  various  technology  vendors  (some  prototypes  reportedly  based  on
blockchain  or  DLT  components),  and  is  entering  a  realization  phase .  These  efforts  reflect  a
complementary adoption  of blockchain tech under government stewardship. Meanwhile, Bitcoin adoption
in places like El Salvador or usage of crypto in inflation-hit countries (Argentina, Turkey informally) shows a
replacement or workaround dynamic  – people using blockchain money when they lose faith in state money,
thereby  disciplining  governments  (El  Salvador’s  dollarized  economy  now  also  has  Bitcoin  ATMs  and
transactions, for better or worse). 
Another interesting “scarce privilege” case is  land/resource rights in developing nations . For example,
some projects propose tokenizing community land rights or water rights to help communities manage
them transparently (though these often still need government buy-in). Supply chain traceability tokens2526

can allocate the privilege of saying a product is “authentic” or meets quotas – for instance, fishing industry
pilots  used blockchain to ensure fishing catches don’t exceed quotas by tracking fish from catch to market
with tokenized catch certificates.
Limitations:  While blockchain can enforce scarcity in the digital realm, tying that to real-world control
remains a challenge. A spectrum token is only meaningful if regulators and devices respect it – which
requires integration with legal frameworks and hardware. For money, a privately issued crypto will not fully
replace fiat unless a whole economy embraces it (which brings volatility and other problems, as seen in El
Salvador’s bumpy Bitcoin rollout). Governments also have tools to fight back – they can regulate exchanges,
ban transactions, or as in the case of some stablecoins, possibly issue their own to crowd out unregulated
ones. Moreover , the  programmability of tokens can be a double-edged sword : it might enable  fine-
grained control (even by governments)  such as programming a CBDC to be non-transferable out of
country (capital control) or to expire if not spent (stimulus with expiry). This raises new governance and civil
liberty concerns. Blockchain doesn’t inherently decide who sets the rules; it just enforces them rigidly. So,
whether blockchain constrains or enhances state power  in allocations depends on who designs the system. A
public cryptocurrency can constrain state monetary power (by limiting their ability to inflate without people
fleeing to crypto), whereas a state-run blockchain system might even expand  state control (through greater
surveillance or programmability). The balance of outcomes  will likely vary by jurisdiction and application. 
In summary, blockchain has proven adept at creating digitally scarce tokens and transparent markets ,
which can significantly improve how privileges are tracked and traded (complementing state systems) and
in some cases pose an outside alternative  that forces states to change (constraining their monopoly). The
trajectory in the near term is that we’ll see  hybrid models : government-sanctioned tokens (like CBDCs or
tokenized licenses) operating alongside (and learning from) private or decentralized tokens, with careful
attention to integrating legal enforceability with the on-chain mechanics.
Case Studies: Blockchain Experiments in Government Functions
(US, EU, UK)
To illustrate the above themes in practice, we examine a series of case studies across the United States,
European Union (and neighbors), and the United Kingdom. These highlight both  successful pilots and
challenges  in  implementing  blockchain  for  government-related  functions,  offering  a  comparative
perspective:
A. Land Registry on Blockchain – Sweden and Georgia
Sweden (EU):  Sweden’s Lantmäteriet  was one of the first European agencies to seriously test blockchain for
land  title  management.  Partnering  with  the  startup  ChromaWay  and  other  firms,  they  built  a  private
blockchain system to handle real estate transactions end-to-end . In this 2017 pilot, the buyer , seller ,
banks, and land registrar would each have a node on the network. Whenever a step occurred (a contract
signed, a mortgage issued, a title updated), a smart contract  on the blockchain recorded it and allowed all
participants to verify the status . The blockchain essentially served as a shared, tamper-proof journal
for the transaction process. The result: they demonstrated cutting the typical time for conveyancing from
months to days , largely by eliminating the manual paperwork and multi-step verification currently needed
. For instance, title registration after a sale could happen almost instantly once conditions (like payment
and mortgage registration) were met, instead of waiting months for various parties to send documents.23

Mats Snäll, the land registry’s head of development, noted that nothing in the pilot indicated the technology
wouldn’t scale, and that it offered  “a good and secure way to have digital originals”  of property contracts,
seemingly  resistant to hacking or corruption . The projected savings (over €100 million/year) and
increased security were strong arguments in its favor . Despite that, Sweden has proceeded cautiously –
as of 2025 the land registry has not fully migrated to blockchain, but the pilot informed ongoing digitization
efforts.  It  underscored  the  need  to  sort  out  network  governance  (who  runs  the  nodes?)  and  legal
alignment  (making sure a blockchain record is legally recognized as the title) before deployment . The
Swedish case is a prime example of a  complementary blockchain solution : it didn’t aim to discard the land
registry’s role, but to  make it more efficient and trustworthy  by sharing the ledger with banks and
buyers in real time. It also highlighted a preference for permissioned chains in government  – control and
privacy were maintained by restricting access to known entities, rather than using a public chain.
Georgia (Eurasia):  We discussed Georgia’s achievement earlier; it’s worth reiterating here as a comparative
note. Georgia’s National Agency of Public Registry, with Bitfury’s help, effectively integrated blockchain at
scale, reportedly becoming  “the first government to secure land titles on the Bitcoin blockchain” . By
2017,  the  Georgian  system  was  operational,  meaning  any  new  land  transaction  would  generate  a
blockchain proof. The Georgian model is often cited in international development circles as a way to boost
trust in property rights in countries with weak institutions . Indeed, the Economist  in 2017 noted
that experts were eyeing Georgia’s experiment  “for proof of whether blockchain technology could alter the
infrastructure  of  government  everywhere.”  The  success  in  Georgia  (a  post-Soviet  state  eager  to
advance economically) provided momentum for similar efforts in other countries: Honduras had announced
plans for a blockchain land registry around 2015 (amid concerns of rampant title fraud), though that faced
delays; countries like Ukraine, Dubai, and others  also engaged in blockchain-for-land projects with varied
progress . Notably, Ukraine  partnered with Bitfury in 2017 to put a range of government data on
blockchain, “the largest of its kind anywhere” according to Reuters  – including not just land titles but
potentially asset registers and more. (Ukraine’s plans were disrupted by other events, but some pilots did
occur .)
United Kingdom:  While not in the original prompt’s list, the UK’s experience provides another EU/Western
perspective. HM Land Registry (England & Wales)  embarked on a project called Digital Street , investigating
blockchain to improve the speed of land transactions. In 2018, it announced a partnership to build a
prototype on  R3’s Corda DLT platform . The idea was similar: to test if distributed ledger tech can
“revolutionise the property buy-sell process”  by sharing data among solicitors, banks, and the Land
Registry instantly . The head of HM Land Registry spoke of an ambition to be the world’s leading land
registry for speed and simplicity, and saw blockchain as a tool toward that goal . Corda was chosen for
its  enterprise  features  like  privacy  and  the  ability  to  encode  complex  workflows  (smart  contract  flow
framework) . The pilot successfully demonstrated that a property sale could be completed in under 10
minutes in a controlled environment (as opposed to the usual weeks) . The UK pilot is a case of public-
private collaboration : it engaged blockchain startups, academics, and industry stakeholders to ensure the
solution fit real-world needs . Though the UK has not “gone live” with a blockchain land registry yet,
the trial informed their broader modernization efforts and indicated that blockchain could “transform land
registry  services  by  improving  speed,  simplicity  and  efficiency,”  as  R3’s  CEO  put  it .  The  UK’s  cautious
approach – testing in R&D but integrating pieces slowly – contrasts with Georgia’s more leapfrog adoption,
reflecting differences in legacy system robustness and risk tolerance.
Lessons:  Across Sweden, Georgia, and the UK, a few takeaways emerge. First, permissioned blockchain
networks  (or  hybrid  models)  are  preferred  by  governments  for  land  registries  –  they  want  known30

validators  (agencies,  banks)  rather  than  unknown  miners.  Second,  blockchain  alone  doesn’t  solve
everything : these projects require legal reforms (e.g. recognizing digital signatures, smart contracts) and
administrative  buy-in.  Third,  where  implemented,  user  experience  can  drastically  improve  (no  lost
paperwork, quicker transactions), and  transparency  improves (all parties see the same ledger). Finally,
these case studies show global knowledge transfer  – countries are learning from each other’s pilots (the
mention of “we will be able to work with blockchain [by] this summer to place real estate extracts in a totally safe
system,”  said  Georgia’s  Justice  Minister ,  touting  being  a  leader  in  e-government ).  This  competition/
cooperation is pushing the technology forward in the public sector .
B. Digital Identity and Verifiable Credentials – EU eIDAS and Beyond
Ensuring trusted identity and credentials is another arena of intense activity, especially in the EU. The
European Union’s eIDAS regulation  (Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services) sets a
framework for cross-border recognition of electronic IDs and signatures. In 2021, the EU proposed an
update (sometimes called eIDAS 2.0 ) which includes a concept of a European Digital Identity Wallet  for all
citizens  and  businesses.  In  this  vision,  people  will  have  a  mobile  app  that  can  store  verified  digital
credentials (national ID, driver’s license, diplomas, bank account info, etc.) that can be used across all 27
member states. Blockchain and decentralized identity technologies play a key role  in this plan.
The EU’s approach leverages the idea of  Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) , where individuals control their
credentials and share them peer-to-peer , with verification happening via decentralized trust registries. The
European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI)  – a network of distributed nodes operated by EU
member state authorities – is being built to support such use cases. Under EBSI, the Verifiable Credentials
model works as follows: trusted authorities (like a university or government agency) issue a credential to a
citizen in digital form and register a proof of that issuance on the EBSI blockchain. When the citizen needs
to prove something (say their age, or their degree), they can present the credential from their digital wallet
directly to a verifier , and the verifier can check the issuer’s signature and status against the blockchain
registry, without needing to call up the issuer each time . The blockchain thus serves as a  publicly
auditable directory of which entities are accredited issuers and what credentials they can issue . It
also can list revoked credentials or expired keys, etc., in an immutable way. Crucially, personal data is not
stored  on-chain  –  only  metadata  and  public  key  info.  This  design  is  highly  aligned  with  privacy
requirements: the EU specifically wants a system that “uses blockchain where it makes sense: to support
the verification of Verifiable Credentials”  and  not to expose personal data . In fact, one of the five
design principles EBSI highlights is that “blockchain is used as an immutable registry of trusted legal entities
[issuers]…  all  other  information  is  shared  directly  between  the  holder  and  verifier,  without  blockchain’s
involvement.”  This  is  a  very  interesting  marriage  of  government  trust  and  blockchain  trust:  the
governments still approve which issuers are trusted  (e.g. by a national scheme), but blockchain ensures
that list of trusted issuers is shared, secure, and in real-time across Europe . It removes reliance on any
single government database when verifying foreign credentials – a French employer can automatically trust
a German university diploma if the German government’s blockchain node vouches that the university is
accredited and the diploma is valid.
This EU digital identity initiative is a  prescriptive case  – the EU is actively  mandating  member states to
adopt this approach in coming years, aiming to reach 80% of citizens with a digital wallet by 2030. It’s
perhaps the most ambitious government-led blockchain-backed identity project in the world. It does not
replace government ID systems; rather , it interlinks them via decentralized tech , effectively constraining
states from siloing identity data  and giving more control to citizens. For example, instead of dozens of45
13
13
13
13
11
separate login accounts and document copies, a citizen might just have their certified attributes in their
wallet and share what’s needed – with the blockchain ensuring the receiving party can instantly verify
authenticity. It addresses a classic trust synchronization problem: how to trust foreign documents – solved
by a ledger of trust operated collectively by countries.
Outside  the  EU,  other  examples  abound:  Estonia’s  e-Residency  program  issues  digital  IDs  to  global
entrepreneurs, and while it doesn’t use blockchain for the IDs themselves, Estonia has used blockchain (KSI
blockchain) to hash the integrity of its government databases (including identity records) since the 2010s, as
a security measure. Ontario, Canada  had a pilot for blockchain-based driver’s licenses (using SSI principles)
and some U.S. states (like Illinois, circa 2017) explored blockchain for birth certificate and vital record
portability. In the UK, there was work on digital evidence and driving tests  on blockchain (DVLA trials),
and the British government-backed  Open Banking  initiative considered blockchain for secure credential
sharing in finance.
The key takeaway  from identity case studies is the emphasis on hybrid decentralized solutions : unlike
currency, where some push pure decentralization, in identity the trend is “government-in-the-loop”  but using
blockchain to enhance privacy, security, and cross-jurisdiction trust. It’s a complement that could gradually
change power dynamics – giving individuals more agency (they hold their credentials, not just the issuing
agency), and making systems more resilient (no single database to hack and alter , since verification is multi-
source and ledger-confirmed). This in turn can constrain misuse: e.g. a corrupt official in one country can’t
issue a fake passport credential that will pass verification, because it won’t be found on the shared ledger of
valid issuers.
C. Central Bank Digital Currencies – Comparative (US, EU, UK)
As previously discussed,  CBDC  exploration is in full swing across major economies. Here we compare
approaches:
European Union (ECB – Digital Euro):  The ECB has completed an investigation phase (2021–2023)
and is moving into a realization phase for a digital euro . The design is likely a two-tier model  (the
ECB issues the digital currency, but distribution is through private banks/payment providers) and a
permissioned  DLT  is  under  consideration  to  handle  transactions.  Security,  privacy,  and  offline
capability are key issues. The ECB’s president Christine Lagarde stated in 2021 the goal to launch
within ~four years  – putting it around 2025, but recent reports push a possible launch to 2028
after extensive pilots . Indeed, the Atlantic Council’s CBDC tracker noted the digital euro pilot
should begin soon (involving testing with consumers and merchants perhaps) . The EU sees this
as not just modernization but strategic autonomy  – ensuring the euro’s role in a digital world and
not ceding ground to foreign tech or currencies . They emphasize that a digital euro will co-
exist with cash, and the blockchain element (if used) will be under high governance – likely using an
enterprise  blockchain  (maybe  based  on  Hyperledger  Fabric  or  similar)  for  the  ledger  that
authorized intermediaries update. Some prototypes by companies (as per ECB reports) included
Hyperledger Fabric and R3 Corda implementations, showing a preference for controlled ledgers.
Privacy has been debated: one option is to allow small-value transactions offline with no tracing (like
digital  cash),  but  larger  transactions  would  be  traceable  for  AML  (Anti-Money  Laundering).
Blockchain’s  auditability  can  thus  be  a  double-edged  sword  for  privacy,  and  central  banks  are
navigating that.•

United Kingdom (Bank of England – “digital pound”):  The UK, outside the Eurozone, is in a similar
position of exploring a retail CBDC. The BoE and HM Treasury issued a joint consultation in early
2023 calling a digital pound “likely needed in the future” and inviting input on design. They envision
it primarily for domestic retail use, safeguarding financial stability. The BoE has done experiments
(Project Rosalind with BIS, etc.) that build prototypes using APIs and ledgers. The likely approach is
also two-tier , permissioned, and not strictly a blockchain but possibly inspired by it. The Bank’s latest
reports emphasize resilience and performance – whatever tech is chosen must handle high volumes
(tens of thousands of TPS) and be secure. They have not committed to blockchain; in fact, the BoE
has been open to either DLT or conventional tech that achieves the same ends. However , they did
note any system would need to be extremely robust, possibly using a private implementation of
something like Ethereum or a similar smart contract platform  to allow programmability (smart
contracts for certain features). The UK is also unique in that it’s a major global finance hub, so they
coordinate closely with international efforts (like ensuring interoperability with other CBDCs for
cross-border payments). We might see the UK leverage existing networks – for example, joining
Project mBridge or others for cross-border CBDC trials. Timeline : BoE said no earlier than 2025 for a
decision to build, and launch could be in later 2020s. A Reuters piece mentioned the digital pound
could be in use by later this decade if approved .
United States (Federal Reserve – Digital Dollar):  The US is a cautious outlier among the big
economies. With the dollar’s global role, the Fed and U.S. Treasury are carefully studying rather than
rushing. In March 2022, President Biden’s executive order asked agencies to evaluate CBDC benefits
and risks . The Fed issued a report in January 2022 outlining possibilities but taking no stance
without  Congressional  support .  Wholesale  vs  Retail:  The  U.S.  is  more  actively  prototyping
wholesale uses (e.g., interbank settlement). The New York Fed’s Project Cedar  in 2022 demonstrated
a prototype for foreign exchange settlement using a blockchain-based wholesale CBDC – it achieved
atomic settlement (simultaneous exchange of currencies) in 10 seconds, showing DLT could improve
cross-currency transfers. On retail, the Boston Fed and MIT’s  Project Hamilton  (Phase 1 report in
2022)  built  a  high-performance  transaction  processor  that  in  testing  could  handle  1.7  million
transactions per second  with near-instant finality – indicating technology for a very scalable digital
dollar is feasible . Interestingly, that prototype combined some blockchain techniques with novel
architectures, but wasn’t a traditional blockchain (it was more a processing engine plus a validated
transaction history). Currently, U.S. progress on a consumer CBDC is described as “moving forward”
only on wholesale, while “stalled” on retail  absent new laws . There is also political pushback in
the U.S. – some in Congress want to prohibit the Fed from issuing a retail CBDC, citing privacy or
government overreach concerns . So the fate of a digital dollar is uncertain. In the meantime, the
U.S. is observing and participating in cross-border pilots (the Atlantic Council notes the U.S. finally
joined a multi-country CBDC test called Project Agora with several other central banks) . This is to
ensure the U.S. isn’t left out of setting global standards. Another nuance: U.S. regulators are focusing
on  stablecoin  regulation  –  arguably  treating  that  as  an  intermediate  step  to  ensure  private
stablecoins (like USDC) are safe, which could serve many retail needs without an official CBDC, or
pave the way for one.
Comparative  insights:  Across  US,  EU,  UK  –  the  EU  is  most  driven  by  policy  cohesion  and  user
convenience  (hence  the  pan-European  wallet  concept  strongly  supported  by  a  regulated  blockchain
infrastructure). The  UK and US are more concerned about financial stability  (they worry how a CBDC
might disintermediate banks or shift credit flows). Technologically, all three are weighing permissioned
DLT versus alternative architectures. None have indicated using a public permissionless blockchain (due to•

throughput,  control,  and  privacy  reasons).  However ,  they  all  borrow  the  innovations  of  crypto:  using
cryptographic wallets for users, possibly using blockchain-inspired consensus for resilience, and aiming for
some level of programmability (e.g. enabling automated payments or logic on the currency). Case outcome
so far:  No Western major economy CBDC is launched yet (contrasting with smaller ones like Bahamas’ Sand
Dollar or Nigeria’s eNaira which are live). But within a few years, we expect at least the digital euro to be in
pilot circulation. These will give insight into how effectively blockchain-tech can modernize money without
causing unintended economic side effects. Notably, a Reuters study in mid-2023  found “all G20 countries
bar one [Argentina] are now in advanced development/pilot of CBDC”  and pointed out “the push for CBDCs
comes as cash use falls and authorities look to ensure they retain control in face of crypto and Big Tech.”  This
encapsulates the theme: blockchain is being used by states to complement and safeguard their function
in money  even as it initially emerged as a challenge to it.
D. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) – Wyoming’s Legal Recognition
The concept of a  DAO  – an organization governed by blockchain-based rules and community voting –
directly  intersects  with  government  in  terms  of  legal  recognition  and  regulation.  In  traditional  terms,
forming  an  organization  (corporation,  partnership,  co-op)  is  a  privilege  granted  by  the  state  via
incorporation statutes. DAOs present themselves as internet-native organizations that operate by code,
often without a clear legal status. This raised questions: can a DAO own assets, enter contracts, or have
limited liability for its members, without being incorporated under some jurisdiction’s law?
Wyoming, USA  has been at the forefront of addressing this. In 2021, Wyoming passed first-of-its-kind
legislation (Bill SF38) that allows DAOs to register as a special type of LLC (Limited Liability Company) .
On  July  1,  2021,  the  law  took  effect  and  the  American  CryptoFed  DAO  became  the  first  legally
recognized DAO in the US . Essentially, Wyoming offered a bridge between on-chain governance
and off-chain legal personality: a DAO can file for LLC status by providing its smart contract and some
information, and then it’s treated as an LLC under state law (with members as shareholders, and the smart
contract operating as the bylaws/operating agreement to the extent it can). The American CryptoFed DAO ,
which aims to create a token-based digital currency system, seized this opportunity – it filed the required
forms, and Wyoming’s Secretary of State acknowledged it as a DAO LLC . This was a groundbreaking
experiment because it tested how a DAO’s on-chain activities would intersect with US securities law and
other regulations. In fact, soon after , the CryptoFed DAO tried to register its tokens with the U.S. SEC and
that  process  became  contentious  (the  SEC  viewed  its  filings  as  deficient,  and  an  administrative  battle
ensued) . The details are beyond our scope, but suffice to say it’s an ongoing story that will set
precedents.
Why is Wyoming doing this?  The state (which also pioneered other crypto-friendly laws) wants to attract
blockchain innovation. By providing legal certainty, it hopes DAOs will base themselves in Wyoming (just like
many corporations incorporate in Delaware). Other U.S. states, like Tennessee and Vermont, have also
passed  laws  regarding  blockchain-based  LLCs  or  recognition  of  smart  contract  governance,  though
Wyoming’s is the most comprehensive. Internationally, other jurisdictions are watching; for example, some
Swiss cantons allow associations that are effectively DAO-like, and there’s discussion in the EU of how to
classify DAOs under existing legal entity forms.
From a government functions perspective, recognizing DAOs is an example of how blockchain is changing
the landscape of organizational governance , and the government’s role shifts from direct oversight to
setting frameworks in which algorithm-governed entities can legally operate. One could say Wyoming’s law53
24
5455
56
5758
14
is complementing  the state’s function of chartering corporations by adding a new tech-enabled category.
At the same time, it constrains  the state in that if DAOs proliferate, some activities that used to be easily
regulated  (through  corporate  intermediaries)  might  occur  in  more  decentralized  ways.  For  instance,  a
traditional cooperative might be regulated by state co-op laws, but a global DAO co-op might now just
register  in  Wyoming  and  have  global  membership  operating  via  tokens  –  raising  questions  on  how
consumer protection, taxation, etc., will be enforced if at all on its activities. Wyoming’s bet is that bringing
DAOs into a legal fold (even a very light one) is better than leaving them completely “offshore” or in legal
limbo.
Cooperative DAOs:  The prompt mentioned “cooperative DAOs in Wyoming” – indeed, some DAOs focus on
collective  ownership  of  real-world  assets  or  community  projects  (basically  digital  co-ops).  CityDAO,  for
example, purchased land in Wyoming collectively as a DAO (it even got a mention by Wyoming’s Governor)
and registered as an LLC. The idea of digitally-native cooperatives  managing resources or businesses via
member  votes  on  blockchain  is  powerful.  If  successful,  it  could  provide  an  alternative  to  traditional
corporate hierarchies and further demonstrate blockchain’s role in synchronizing collective decisions  and
managing shared property (tying back to our earlier sections). Wyoming’s framework gives such groups a
sandbox to try real projects legally – CityDAO is experimenting with governance of a physical parcel of land
by token holders; another one, Krause House DAO, aims to purchase an NBA basketball team collectively
someday via a DAO structure (a lofty goal, but they are raising funds via tokens). Each of these tests the
boundaries of both blockchain tech (can on-chain governance manage complex real assets?) and law (will
regulators accept a token vote as legitimate corporate governance?).
UK/EU perspective on DAOs:  Neither the UK nor EU has dedicated DAO laws yet, but discussions are
underway. The UK Law Commission in 2022–23 examined how English law might accommodate DAOs,
looking at whether they could fit into trust or partnership frameworks. The EU, through its blockchain
initiatives, is aware of DAOs but likely to address them indirectly via existing legal structures or through
upcoming cryptoasset regulations (MiCA, etc., which focus more on tokens than governance structures). It’s
possible the EU may eventually harmonize certain aspects (for example, recognizing a DAO organized in
one country under some legal form EU-wide).
Outcome so far:  Wyoming’s experiment is ongoing. By early 2024, only a handful of DAOs had registered
as LLCs – it’s a niche but growing area. The legal battles (like CryptoFed vs SEC) will determine how attractive
it is for others to follow. But even if few formally register , the existence of legally recognized DAOs is
symbolic: it shows a government can  adapt its monopoly on granting corporate status  to accommodate
blockchain-based governance. It’s a case of government not being replaced but adjusting – handing some
control to code and communities, while still providing a wrapper of legal legitimacy. For individuals in the
crypto world, it’s encouraging: they see a path to connect decentralized projects with real-world commerce
(like owning real estate, hiring employees, etc., via a DAO LLC).
E. Supply Chain Traceability – IBM/Maersk’s TradeLens
Global trade involves many actors – manufacturers, shipping lines, ports, customs, importers – and the
exchange of documents and data  among them. It’s notoriously paper-heavy and fragmented, leading to
delays, fraud, and opacity. TradeLens, launched by IBM and Maersk in 2018, was a flagship example of
using blockchain to tackle this by providing a shared platform for supply chain data . The idea was to get
all parties onto one distributed ledger  where shipping events (like container departure, arrival, customs
clearance, etc.) and key documents (bills of lading, packing lists, certificates) would be  uploaded and
15
digitally signed , creating a single, tamper-proof history for each shipment . Maersk, one of the
world’s largest shipping carriers, contributed its data and network, and IBM provided the Hyperledger
Fabric blockchain technology.
Achievements:  TradeLens attracted significant participation – by 2021 it had 94+ organizations  integrated,
including  major  ocean  carriers  (besides  Maersk,  they  got  MSC,  CMA-CGM,  etc.),  port  operators,  and
Customs authorities in countries like the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and Australia .
At one point, 20% of global container shipping volume was flowing through TradeLens in terms of data
coverage . The platform would capture over a million shipment events per day on the ledger .
Customs agencies found it useful as they could get real-time, trusted data  on incoming shipments well in
advance – e.g. knowing what a container is supposed to contain, who packed it, and its journey, which helps
target inspections. An IBM trade expert described it as implementing the “data pipeline” vision customs
have long wanted  – continuous visibility from origin to destination. Blockchain’s role was to ensure no
single party (not even Maersk or IBM) could unilaterally alter records – all data was shared via nodes and
cryptographically chained , so participants could trust that what they see is what others saw at the time
. Key features of TradeLens’ blockchain  included: a shared replicated ledger  (each participant runs
a node, gets a copy of data relevant to them),  immutability  (once added, data can’t be changed, only
amended with corrections visible), permissioning  (data partitioned so only those in a shipment’s channel see
it),  and  selective  endorsement  (only  relevant  parties  validate  a  transaction,  avoiding  heavy  consensus
overhead) . These features leveraged Hyperledger Fabric’s enterprise-oriented design and meant
TradeLens  did  not  use  energy-intensive  proof-of-work  (unlike  Bitcoin) .  Also,  smart  contracts  in
TradeLens  automated  workflows  (e.g.  when  a  ship  arrives  in  port,  a  smart  contract  could  trigger  a
notification to customs and port operators) .
In essence, TradeLens aimed to complement and improve government and industry processes . It didn’t
replace customs or port management – instead, it provided a neutral data highway  where all parties could
publish  and  retrieve  the  single  version  of  truth  for  shipments.  This  potentially  constrained  unethical
behavior: e.g. a corrupt actor couldn’t slip in a fake manifest late, because every document’s timestamp and
origin were recorded; discrepancies would be evident to all. It also could reduce inefficiencies – in one oft-
cited example, a simple shipment of avocados from Africa to Europe had to go through 30 organizations,
100+ people, and 200 communications ; TradeLens promised to cut that by eliminating redundant re-
entry of data and letting each stakeholder access the info as needed from the ledger .
Challenges and Discontinuation:  Despite technical viability, TradeLens encountered adoption hurdles.
Shipping is a competitive industry with thin margins. Many companies (and even some governments) were
hesitant to join a platform co-owned by  Maersk , fearing a competitive disadvantage or data ownership
issues.  Competitors  like  CMA-CGM  initially  held  out  but  later  joined;  however ,  by  late  2022,  Maersk
announced that TradeLens would be discontinued . They stated that “the need for full global industry
collaboration has not been achieved… TradeLens has not reached the level of commercial viability necessary to
continue” . The platform was shut down in early 2023 . This outcome underscores that in multi-
stakeholder networks, technology is only part of the equation  – governance, incentives, and trust among
competitors  are  equally  crucial.  Maersk  and  IBM  tried  to  position  TradeLens  as  an  “open,  neutral
platform”  (even  adjusting  the  governance  model  to  assuage  fears ),  but  ultimately  some  major
carriers  invested  in  a  different  blockchain  consortium  ( Global  Shipping  Business  Network,  GSBN  led  by
Chinese carriers), and some governments may have pursued their own solutions.5960

For governments (customs), the shuttering of TradeLens was a disappointment because many had started
integrating with it. However , the knowledge gained isn’t lost – it demonstrated what a digitized trade
workflow could look like. We might see new international efforts (perhaps through the World Customs
Organization or WTO) building on a similar model, but with more neutral governance (e.g. not led by one
carrier). In any case, TradeLens proved the concept  that a permissioned blockchain can handle global trade
data  at  scale ,  and  that  it  can  improve  transparency  and  reduce  delays .  For  example,  the  Customs
authority of the Netherlands reported improved ability to validate manifests with TradeLens data, and the
Saudi Customs did a pilot integrating TradeLens with their systems to get better visibility of incoming cargo.
Comparative angle:  The UK and EU had ports involved in TradeLens (Rotterdam, Felixstowe etc.), and UK
customs  was  reportedly  exploring  it.  Post-Brexit,  UK  customs  has  big  IT  changes,  and  systems  like
TradeLens were considered for future models. The EU has its own initiatives for digitizing trade documents
(the eFTI regulation – electronic Freight Transport Info – which could work with blockchain solutions). The
US (CBP – Customs and Border Protection) also piloted TradeLens on select trade lanes. All these show
governments collaborating in consortia led by private sector  – a trend in blockchain for supply chains.
Unlike currency or identity, where government might lead, here industry led and tried to bring government
along. The failure of TradeLens doesn’t mean blockchain isn’t useful in supply chain, but it illustrates that
consortium governance  is tricky. In this case, maybe the balance of power wasn’t acceptable to enough
players.
The learnings likely will inform future platforms: perhaps an international body could host a TradeLens-like
ledger where all carriers and customs are truly equal partners (a bit like how SWIFT is cooperative for
banks). Or , smaller scale successes might occur in specific supply chains (there have been blockchain pilots
in pharmaceuticals for tracking drugs to fight counterfeits, in diamonds tracing origin (Everledger), and in
food safety – e.g. IBM Food Trust  uses a similar Hyperledger system to trace grocery supply chains, and
has seen adoption by Walmart and others to quickly pinpoint contamination sources ).
In sum, TradeLens  demonstrated both the strengths and challenges of enterprise blockchain . It showed
that  auditability, shared ledgers, and smart contracts can greatly modernize inter-organizational
processes , aligning with government’s need for better oversight (customs compliance) while benefiting
industry with efficiency. Yet, it also taught that unless the business ecosystem  is fully on board, even the
best  tech  won’t  survive.  The  shutdown  press  release  by  Maersk  emphasized  “full  global  industry
collaboration… not achieved” , highlighting a non-technical failure point. This suggests future efforts must
perhaps involve more stakeholders in governance from the start to truly be neutral.
These  case  studies,  spanning  different  functions  and  regions,  reveal  a  spectrum  of  outcomes:  some
successes  (Georgia’s  land  titles,  EU’s  verifiable  credentials  pilots,  the  promise  of  CBDCs) ,  some
ongoing experiments (Wyoming DAOs, UK land registry) , and some  setbacks (TradeLens) . Together
they provide invaluable lessons for how blockchain can be harnessed by or against government roles.
Comparing Blockchain Technologies for Civic Applications
Different  blockchain  platforms  and  architectures  vary  greatly  in  their  features  and  suitability  for
government-related use cases. Here we compare some prominent ones – Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric,7980
75
17
Cosmos  – and the general dichotomy of  permissionless vs permissioned  blockchains, in the context of
civic or public-sector applications.
Ethereum  (Public  Permissionless):  Ethereum  is  the  largest  open  blockchain  with  full  smart  contract
capabilities. As a  permissionless  network, anyone can participate in validating (via proof-of-stake) and
anyone can deploy or use applications. Its strengths include a huge developer community, mature tools,
and high security (the mainnet has never been compromised at the consensus level and now secures
billions in value). For government uses, Ethereum’s  auditability and transparency  are a double-edged
sword – they provide public trust (anyone can independently verify the ledger’s state), but also mean data is
visible  to  all  (which  is  a  problem  for  sensitive  information)  and  usage  costs  (“gas”  fees)  can  be
unpredictable. Ethereum is ideal when a use case requires broad public engagement or neutrality . For
example, if a government wants to prove something to the public in a verifiable way (like publishing a hash
of election results or a budget report so it’s tamper-evident), using Ethereum or another public chain could
be effective. We saw Georgia anchor to Bitcoin’s chain; similarly a government could anchor to Ethereum for
transparency.  Ethereum  can  also  host  decentralized  applications  (DApps)  relevant  to  civic  life  –  e.g.
decentralized voting systems, petition platforms, or public grant funding DAOs – that anyone  can inspect.
However , scalability  and governance  issues make Ethereum less favored for core government databases;
it can currently handle ~15 transactions per second on-chain (though Layer 2 solutions greatly expand this),
and transaction fees, while much lower post-upgrade, are not negligible. Also, governments cannot easily
control or reverse anything on Ethereum if something goes wrong, since it’s decentralized by design. 
In practice, we see Ethereum being used more by the private sector or NGOs in civic contexts  than by
governments  directly.  For  instance,  some  municipalities  have  issued  community  tokens  or  NFTs  on
Ethereum (like “MiamiCoin” was launched on Stacks (Bitcoin sidechain) for Miami, and other cities explored
similar). The European Investment Bank (EIB)  issued a €100m digital bond in 2021 that was registered on
Ethereum’s blockchain – essentially leveraging the public chain for trust in a financial instrument. This
shows a government-related entity using Ethereum’s transparency and global verification properties .
But most government projects choose permissioned variants for direct service provision.
Hyperledger Fabric (Permissioned Consortium):  Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source framework from the
Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger project, is designed for  enterprise/private blockchains . It forgoes the
concept  of  cryptocurrency  entirely  and  instead  provides  a  modular  platform  where  a  set  of  known
organizations can run a blockchain network with  pluggable consensus (like practical Byzantine fault
tolerance  algorithms  or  even  simple  ordering  services) .  Fabric  emphasizes  privacy  and  controlled
sharing : it has features like channels  (subnets so that only relevant parties see certain transactions) and
fine-grained access control. This makes it appealing for use cases like supply chain, records management,
etc., where not all data should be public. We saw Fabric used in TradeLens  and IBM Food Trust , and many
government pilots. For example, Fabric was used in an Illinois birth registration pilot  (each hospital and
the state health department running nodes, sharing birth records). Also, the  Chinese BSN (Blockchain-
based Service Network)  uses Fabric (and others) to offer permissioned chains to businesses and local
governments in China for various apps. Fabric’s performance  can be tuned well (hundreds or thousands of
TPS  in  closed  environments),  and  because  no  mining  is  needed,  it’s  energy  efficient  and  low-latency
(transactions finalize in seconds). 
The  downside  of  Hyperledger  Fabric  is  that  it  is  more  centralized  by  nature  –  you  must  trust  the
consortium members to some extent. It’s not open to public participation, so it sacrifices the censorship-
resistance of a public chain. For governments, this is often acceptable or even desired: they want  control47
18
over who sees or validates data (for legal compliance). Fabric also requires more heavy lifting in setup –
there’s no existing global network, you have to create a network from scratch for your use case, which
involves coordination among participants (and as we saw, that’s as much a social challenge as a technical
one). In summary, Fabric is suitable when multiple known stakeholders need to share a ledger for a
public  service  or  inter-agency  process ,  and  where  privacy,  speed,  and  customizability  are  more
important than open decentralization. Use cases: interbank clearing (some central bank experiments used
Fabric), supply chains (TradeLens, Food Trust), digital identity consortia (Fabric was used in some national ID
pilots), and more. Indeed, as one source notes,  governments are adopting Hyperledger to enhance
transparency while maintaining control , e.g. for sharing public records among agencies securely .
Fabric’s  smart contract (chaincode)  can be written in general languages like Java, Go, etc., making it
flexible for enterprise developers .
Cosmos  (Interoperable  Sovereign  Chains):  Cosmos  is  a  different  beast  –  more  of  an  ecosystem  or
framework than a single blockchain . It enables the creation of application-specific blockchains (called
“zones”) that can interconnect via the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Each zone has its own
validators and rules (it could be permissionless or permissioned, PoS or other consensus, etc.), but thanks
to a standard protocol, they can transfer data or tokens to each other through Cosmos hubs . The Cosmos
SDK has been popular for projects that want more control than just writing smart contracts on someone
else’s chain; for instance, the Binance Chain  (for Binance’s decentralized exchange) was built on Cosmos
tech, as are others like Crypto.org chain, Terra (before its collapse), and Secret Network  (a privacy-focused
chain). 
For government applications, Cosmos offers an intriguing middle path: a government (or consortium) can
easily spin up its own blockchain, customize it to its needs (governance, token, privacy settings), but still
have the ability to  connect with other blockchains  securely if desired. This could be valuable for , say,
cross-border interoperability of government blockchains (imagine each country has its own chain for certain
records but they can share select data via IBC). Also, Cosmos uses  Tendermint BFT consensus , which
provides fast finality (transactions finalize in a couple seconds) and high throughput, which could meet
many  public  sector  demands.  It’s  inherently  modular  and  sovereign :  each  chain’s  governance  is
independent, which might appeal to government entities who want full control over their infrastructure
(unlike being just one of many dApps on Ethereum). At the same time, it’s less battle-tested in hostile open
environments than Ethereum. 
One example of Cosmos tech in a civic context might be the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure
(EBSI)  itself – EBSI is reportedly using a variant of Hyperledger Besu and/or Tendermint  for its network
(they evaluated various, not sure final pick). Tendermint (Cosmos core) being considered indicates interest
in those features. Another example: some cities or regions could launch local Cosmos-based networks for
community coins or digital vouchers, which can connect to the wider crypto economy via Cosmos hubs if
needed.  As  of  now,  we  haven’t  seen  a  government-run  Cosmos  chain  publicized,  but  some  public
permissioned chains use Tendermint  (e.g. the  CBDC of Thailand  used a Tendermint-based system in
Project Inthanon, and France’s CBDC pilot  with Tezos uses a variant of Tendermint). Cosmos’s emphasis on
interoperability  aligns with government needs to avoid vendor lock-in – they don’t want to be stuck in one
platform silo in the future.81

19
Permissioned  vs  Permissionless  –  Summary  of  Trade-offs:  The  choice  often  boils  down  to  this
fundamental decision. 
Permissionless (e.g. Ethereum mainnet, Bitcoin, etc.):  These offer  maximal transparency, security
through decentralization, and neutrality . They are good when the goal is public verifiability and
inclusion of broad participants (e.g. global communities, or public accountability). However , they
have drawbacks of uncertain governance  (protocol updates decided by open communities, not by
government mandate), potential performance issues, and regulatory challenges  (data on a public
chain might conflict with privacy laws like GDPR if not handled properly, for instance). Governments
are generally cautious to rely on a permissionless network for core services because they can’t
control it. But they may use it for anchoring data (for integrity proofs) or for interacting with an
existing user base (if many citizens already use a public chain, a service might be deployed there to
reach them). One allowed use is publishing open data to a blockchain to ensure it’s not altered ,
which some municipalities have done (to increase trust in government data). 
Permissioned (e.g. Hyperledger, Corda, private Ethereum networks):  These give governments and their
partners  full control over participants and protocol rules . They can ensure compliance (only
vetted  nodes  see  data,  etc.),  and  can  more  easily  meet  throughput  demands  by  using  simpler
consensus  methods  since  trust  is  federated.  They  integrate  better  with  existing  IT  and  legal
processes  (you  can  know  who  to  hold  accountable  if  something  goes  wrong).  The  trade-off  is
reduced decentralization  – effectively, a permissioned chain is more like a distributed database
with cryptographic auditability. It may not garner the same level of trust from an external observer
as a public chain (“the government and its friends operate it; can we fully trust them?” one might
ask). However , a counterpoint is that even a permissioned blockchain can increase trust relative to
one agency’s silo , because multiple independent parties (maybe different government departments
or external auditors) hold copies and must concur , which reduces unilateral tampering risk . 
For many civic applications, a hybrid approach  is emerging: use permissioned blockchains for operational
needs, but anchor or periodically checkpoint data to a public chain for accountability. This way, you get the
best of both – efficiency and privacy for day-to-day, and an immutable public audit trail for oversight. We
saw this model in Georgia’s land registry (private chain + Bitcoin anchoring) , and others are adopting it.
Platform Specifics:  A quick comparative note on R3 Corda  (though not explicitly asked, it’s relevant): Corda
is another permissioned DLT popular in finance, which the UK Land Registry pilot used . It’s tailored to
bilaterally shared states (not all nodes see everything, only those in a transaction), aligning with privacy
needs of banks or government units. Corda and Hyperledger Fabric often compete in enterprise settings;
both  forgo  mining  and  have  strong  permissioning.  The  Cosmos  vs  Polkadot  debate  in  blockchain
interoperability is also notable – Polkadot provides a more structured shared security model (all para-chains
rely on a central relay chain), whereas Cosmos is looser (each zone independent). Polkadot has seen some
government-related trials too (e.g. in energy grids). The choice depends on whether a government wants a
ready-made ecosystem (then build on Ethereum or Polkadot) or more freedom (Cosmos or custom Fabric
network).•

In  conclusion,  Ethereum,  Hyperledger,  Cosmos  represent  three  archetypes  –  public  general-purpose,
private consortium, and customizable interoperable. In civic contexts: 
Ethereum (and similar public chains like Tezos, Algorand, etc.) might be best for  citizen-facing
transparency projects  or where  international interoperability and public trust  are paramount
and data can be public (or shielded via cryptography but on a public ledger). For instance, an
international aid organization might use Ethereum to distribute relief funds via stablecoins to ensure
every transaction is auditable by donors .
Hyperledger  Fabric  (and  Corda,  etc.)  shine  in  inter-agency  or  public-private  networks  where
participants are known and the priority is to streamline processes and cut out paper , but not to
expose data to the world. Government adoption so far has largely been here – e.g. blockchain for
tax records sharing among departments , or a consortium of hospitals and a health regulator
sharing credentials of doctors .
Cosmos  (and  similar  like  Hyperledger  Besu  for  permissioned  Ethereum,  or  frameworks  like
Quorum ,  Avalanche subnets , etc.) are attractive to build  bespoke solutions  that still connect to
wider ecosystems. For example, a national bank might launch a Cosmos-SDK chain for its CBDC
so it can finely tune it, but allow that chain to connect to other national chains for cross-border
payments via hubs, rather than each using separate siloed tech.
Finally, when evaluating suitability, one must consider  governance of the platform itself . Ethereum is
governed  by  a  global  community  (with  vitalik  &  co  but  also  miners/validators,  etc.),  Hyperledger  is
maintained by a foundation and you run your own network governance, Cosmos is open-source with many
contributors and each chain governed by its operators. Governments may prefer technologies with strong
support and known governance: Ethereum and Hyperledger both are backed by large communities and
organizations  (Ethereum  Foundation,  Linux  Foundation)  so  they  feel  “safer”  in  terms  of  longevity  and
support than perhaps a very new platform.
To encapsulate:
Ethereum (public)  – Great for transparency and broad trust , but ensure privacy layers if needed .
Not directly controlled by gov, so use for public audit trails or citizen engagement tools; careful with
volatile costs and regulatory uncertainties of public chain use.
Hyperledger Fabric (permissioned)  – Great for controlled networks and privacy , enterprise-grade ,
but relies on consortium trust. Use for back-office optimization, secure data sharing among known
entities, etc. Many government pilots show it works well (high throughput, etc.), but success needs
strong consortium governance (clear rules among participants).
Cosmos (interoperability & custom chains)  – Great for  flexibility and scalability ,  sovereignty of
infrastructure  (each chain = full control), and future-proofing with inter-chain communication. Use if
you foresee multiple blockchains that need to talk, or if you want to avoid being locked into one
network. Requires more technical expertise to launch and maintain your own chain though.
Ultimately,  the  “best”  technology  depends  on  the  specific  civic  application  requirements:  privacy  vs
transparency, scale, legal constraints, and ecosystem maturity . Often the decision is to start with a•

permissioned/private setup (to get stakeholders comfortable and comply with law), and leave an option to
migrate or connect to public networks as the technology and regulations evolve. Many projects even use
dual deployment : e.g. run Hyperledger Fabric for main operations but periodically publish a hash to
Ethereum  (for  public  accountability).  That  hybrid  strategy  is  becoming  common  as  a  way  to  leverage
strengths of both worlds.
Conclusion: Toward a Realistic Synthesis of Blockchain and
Government
Blockchain technologies have catalyzed a re-examination of how we establish trust in societal functions
typically  overseen  by  governments.  Through  theoretical  analysis  and  practical  pilots,  we  find  that
blockchain can indeed reinforce and sometimes redefine core government functions  – but often not in
the absolutist “replace the state” manner some early enthusiasts envisioned. Instead, the emerging picture
is nuanced:
Notarization  and  Record-Keeping:  Blockchain  is  highly  effective  at  securing  records  against
tampering  and providing multi-party transparency. It can  complement state registries  to make
them more resilient (as seen in land, identity, and certificate use cases) and in specific niches even
replace  traditional notaries (e.g. using a blockchain timestamp instead of a notarized paper). Yet, the
state’s role in enforcing and contextualizing those records remains vital . The realistic near-term
impact is that states which adopt blockchain for registries will likely see  greater efficiency, cost
savings, and public trust  in those services . States that don’t might face external blockchain
alternatives  (like  people  using  Bitcoin  for  property-like  claims  or  organizations  like  Wikipedia
leveraging blockchain for archival) that could challenge their notary monopoly indirectly.
Collective Decision-Making:  In areas like voting and governance, blockchain introduces powerful
tools for auditability and direct participation . However , due to security and social challenges, it’s
more a  constraint and supplement  on government processes than a wholesale replacement. It
pushes governments to improve transparency (knowing that citizens now expect verifiable integrity –
e.g. “publish the hashes of vote tallies so we can independently check”). It also provides a sandbox
for new governance models (DAOs) that, if successful, might influence how local or even national
governance  could  evolve  (for  instance,  more  liquid  democracy  or  participatory  budgeting  via
blockchain voting, once tech matures). In the medium term, we anticipate incremental adoption :
blockchain-based voting for specific groups (overseas military, shareholder votes, party primaries)
will  grow  as  security  improves,  and  smart  contracts  might  automate  certain  government
decisions  (especially  in  resource  allocations,  like  automatic  disbursements  when  conditions  are
met). But broad elections and legislatures will likely only cautiously integrate blockchain (perhaps
using it for result verification  or e-petitions) until/unless solutions to known risks are proven. 
Allocation of Privileges (Money & Licenses):  This is where blockchain has both the  most direct
challenge and the most collaborative response . Cryptocurrencies opened Pandora’s box on who
controls money. Governments are responding not by banning the tech (in most cases) but by co-
opting it – developing CBDCs and tightening oversight on crypto. We foresee a  coexistence  of
sovereign digital currencies and private crypto, with each influencing the other . In stable economies,
CBDCs may strengthen the state’s hand (enhanced monetary policy tools, more transparent fiscal
transfers). In unstable regimes, people may continue turning to Bitcoin or stablecoins as a constraint•

on bad policies (hyperinflation, capital freeze). The monetary monopoly  of states is unlikely to be
usurped globally by Bitcoin – but it is already constrained by it , evidenced by how seriously central
banks  take  the  CBDC  race  and  crypto  regulation .  In  licenses/quotas,  blockchain  will  likely
supplement  processes  (with  tokenized  permits,  auctions  on-chain  for  transparency,  etc.).  For
example, we might see a major country’s spectrum auction run on a blockchain system  within the
next decade to ensure fairness and maybe even enable secondary markets for spectrum via tokens –
a  complement  that  makes  the  allocation  more  efficient,  while  the  state  still  sets  rules  and
adjudicates disputes. 
Platform  Choices:  Governments  (US,  EU,  UK  alike)  are  converging  on  an  understanding  that
different use cases demand different blockchain designs . They’ll use permissioned networks for
internal  and  interagency  work  (often  leveraging  standards  from  Hyperledger  or  enterprise
Ethereum variants), and consider public or hybrid networks when citizen trust and engagement
are key . The comparative analysis suggests governments will not “pick one chain to rule them all,”
but rather adopt a portfolio approach  – much like they use a variety of databases and IT systems
today, they’ll use a variety of blockchain networks, possibly bridged. Interoperability frameworks (like
Cosmos’s IBC, or initiatives to standardize digital identity and asset formats) will be critical so that
this patchwork still results in a coherent user experience for citizens across services. 
Global  Collaboration  and  Competition:  The  case  studies  show  a  healthy  exchange  of  lessons
across borders. The EU leads in regulatory-framework-backed adoption  (digital identity, possibly
digital euro). The US leads in private sector innovation  (many blockchain startups and protocols)
but lags in federal adoption (though some states lead, like Wyoming). The UK is positioning itself
as a pragmatist  – endorsing innovation (e.g. Law Commission on DAOs, fintech sandbox) while
being careful on systemic changes. This suggests that no one country will dominate all aspects ;
rather , each will contribute where its strengths lie. International standards bodies (ISO, W3C for
credentials, etc.) and consortia will play a big role in ensuring these national or regional solutions
can work together . For instance, if the EU’s blockchain for diplomas and the U.S.’s eventual approach
for digital credentials (should they adopt one) use compatible standards, that would be a win for
citizens globally. 
Constraints and the State’s Future Role:  Importantly, even as blockchain can constrain certain
state powers (by distributing trust or enabling alternatives), it can also  strengthen the state’s
capacity  in positive ways – to deliver services more transparently and efficiently. We are likely
heading toward a model of the  “augmented state”  – where government leverages decentralizing
technologies to augment its services, and citizens enjoy greater trust without needing to trust  (i.e.
they trust the system because it’s verifiable , not just because the government says “trust us”).
The state’s monopoly on force and legitimacy is not directly under threat by blockchain (one still
needs courts and police, which blockchain doesn’t replace), but its monopoly on trust mediation is
eroding. In areas from identity to currency, people have new options to achieve trust (through math
and consensus algorithms) rather than through an institution. This is pushing governments to adopt
a more collaborative and transparent posture  – joining networks rather than only commanding
them. States that embrace this (like Estonia, or Wyoming at the state level) could boost their digital
economies and citizen satisfaction. Those that resist might find shadow systems developing anyway
(like  parallel  crypto  economies  or  unofficial  record-keeping  via  blockchain  that  bypasses  state
systems).24

Prescriptive Outlook:  Governments should approach blockchain neither as panacea nor as threat, but as a
tool in the governance toolbox  – one that is particularly well-suited to problems of inter-organizational
coordination, auditability, and credibility of data . A realistic path is to start with pilot projects (as many
have), share results (to not reinvent wheels), and gradually scale successful pilots into production. Law and
regulation  need  updating  alongside:  clarifying  the  legal  status  of  blockchain  records,  enabling  digital
signatures, providing oversight for when algorithms make decisions, and protecting citizens (e.g. if a smart
contract has a bug, who is liable?). 
The comparative lessons suggest a few recommendations:
Use blockchain where it adds clear value (transparency, integrity, automation), not just for
buzz.  The EU’s principle of “Blockchain where it makes sense, otherwise don’t”  is wise. For example,
a single-agency database might not need a blockchain, but a cross-border or multi-stakeholder
process might benefit greatly.
Invest in identity and credential infrastructure now.  This is low-hanging fruit where blockchain
can reduce paperwork and fraud (diplomas, licenses, etc.) and pave the way for bigger things. The
EU  is  doing  this  with  EBSI;  others  should  follow  or  collaborate  so  that,  for  instance,  a  COVID
vaccination certificate or a professional license can be universally verified without central silos.
Collaborate on governance frameworks for consortia.  TradeLens’s fate shows that governance is
make-or-break. Governments, as neutral arbiters, could convene industry to create more inclusive
governance for shared blockchain platforms (maybe a public-private utility model). If Maersk-led
didn’t work, perhaps a port authority-led or UN-led trade blockchain might gain trust. 
Anticipate and legislate for DAOs and crypto assets.  Wyoming’s head start might attract talent
and  capital;  other  jurisdictions  may  want  to  create  their  own  legal  pathways  for  decentralized
structures to operate responsibly. The UK and EU should consider how to integrate DAO-like entities
into their legal systems, to harness innovation while mitigating risks (e.g. ensure DAOs can be
accountable for real-world obligations). Regulatory clarity in things like defining tokens (utility vs
security) and tax treatment is also essential to let beneficial projects flourish and bad actors be
addressed. 
Focus on interoperability and open standards.  Each government chain or system should adhere
to common standards (for data formats, communication protocols) so that down the line they can
connect. Siloed blockchains would be a shameful repeat of siloed databases. Initiatives like the
Blockchain Services Infrastructure in the EU, the Baseline Protocol (for integrating Ethereum
with enterprise systems), and global forums (OECD, ISO TC307)  should be actively supported by
governments to harmonize efforts.
Maintain  a  human-centric  and  rights-centric  approach.  As  governments  implement  these
technologies, they must uphold privacy (GDPR and similar should guide designs), equity (ensuring
digital divide issues are addressed so that blockchain solutions don’t exclude those without tech
access), and recourse (if a smart contract denies a benefit wrongly, a human appeals process must
exist). Blockchain can increase transparency for citizens  into government, but governments should
also be transparent about their use of blockchain. Open-source implementations and independent
audits can build trust that the government’s blockchain systems do what they claim.•

In conclusion, blockchain will not render governments obsolete – but it will change how they operate  and
how trust is distributed. Much like the internet forced governments to become more transparent and
citizen-centric,  the  rise  of  blockchain  is  forcing  governments  to  become  more  platform-like  and
collaborative . Those that adapt could see improved governance outcomes: less corruption (since records
are immutable ), faster service delivery , and greater civic engagement (if citizens can directly hold
and  verify  information).  Those  that  don’t  might  see  a  gradual  outsourcing  of  trust  to  private  or
decentralized networks, potentially losing grip on certain functions. The evidence so far points to a middle
ground: blockchains and governments will co-evolve , each influencing the other . In the near- to medium-
term,  expect  to  see  blockchain  credibly  substituting  specific  government  record-keeping  and
transactional processes , while in other areas acting as a  complementary layer of assurance  above
government processes, and in yet others as a constraint that keeps governments honest  in the face of
external alternatives.
The path forward is not about state vs technology , but about using technology to build a better state  –
one that is more  open, accountable, and effective . Blockchain can be a powerful ally in that mission if
applied with careful consideration of its strengths and limits. The comparative experiences in the US, EU,
and UK demonstrate both enthusiasm and caution, innovation and regulation. By learning from each other
and from trial and error , governments can harness the “trust machine” that is blockchain to strengthen the
social contract, rather than disrupt it. The endgame is a world where citizens trust the system because
they can verify it  – and that could align perfectly with the fundamental purpose of government: to serve
the public with integrity.
