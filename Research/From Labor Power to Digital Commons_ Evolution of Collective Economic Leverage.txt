From Labor Power to Digital Commons: Evolution
of Collective Economic Leverage
Foundations of Labor’s Economic and Political Power
Throughout history, labor has been the central source of economic production and a basis of political
power . From pre-industrial agrarian societies through the industrial revolutions, working people leveraged
certain structural features of labor to assert rights and negotiate with those in power . By examining labor’s
role  across  different  eras  and  deriving  first  principles ,  we  can  identify  why  labor  was  historically
indispensable and powerful. In particular , six key characteristics underpinned labor’s leverage: universality,
inalienability, perishability, heterogeneity, moral legitimacy,  and reciprocity .
Labor across Eras – A Global Historical View:  In feudal agrarian economies, most people’s “labor” was tied
to land (e.g. peasants tilling soil or artisans in guilds). Peasant revolts and guild strikes were early assertions
of labor power , though often limited by rigid hierarchies. With the  Industrial Revolution , wage labor
emerged  as  the  dominant  mode:  masses  of  workers  in  factories  had  little  initial  power ,  but  the
concentration of workers in mines and mills spurred collective organizing. The late 19th and early 20th
centuries saw the rise of labor unions and socialist movements worldwide – from Britain and the U.S. to
colonial regions – all demanding better conditions and political voice. By the mid-20th century (after the
Great  Depression  and  World  Wars),  a  “social  contract”  was  forged  in  many  countries:  organized  labor
accepted industrial discipline in exchange for living wages, welfare provisions, and legal rights (e.g. the New
Deal  in  the  U.S.,  post-war  social  democracy  in  Western  Europe).  In  this  era,  labor’s  leverage  was
institutionalized  via  collective  bargaining,  labor  parties,  and  laws  guaranteeing  the  right  to  organize.
However , late 20th-century globalization and automation began eroding these gains – capital became more
mobile and technology started replacing routine jobs, weakening the bargaining power of national labor
unions. Yet even as union density fell, the structural features of labor  remained inherently present. Below
we detail those six features and how they gave labor unique power:
Universality:  Nearly  everyone  is  endowed  with  the  capacity  to  work.  Labor  is  a  ubiquitous
endowment  – unlike land or capital, which are concentrated, labor power (the ability to exert effort)
is distributed across the entire population. This universality meant that historically the working class
was the majority, forming a broad base for social movements. It also ensured that labor was a
necessary input in  every  industry and locale. No matter the era – be it ancient farms or modern
factories – human labor was needed everywhere, making workers collectively “non-substitutable” on
the whole. Even as technology advanced, labor’s universality persisted (albeit with shifts in required
skills). Because everyone had labor to give, there was a built-in democratic potential: if workers
organized en masse (e.g. general strikes), they could wield nationwide economic disruption, a potent
source of political pressure.
Inalienability:  Labor cannot be separated from the person who labors – it is inherent to human
life and dignity . Unlike a commodity or machine, a person’s labor power is not something that can
be permanently sold or transferred; it can only be rented for a period (as wages for work). As•

economist Karl Polanyi famously noted, “Labor is only another name for a human activity which goes
with life itself…nor can that activity be detached from the rest of life, be stored or mobilized.” . This
inalienability meant that an employer could never fully own workers the way one owns a machine
(except under slavery, which was outlawed on moral grounds). Workers always retained the right to
withhold their labor – to quit, strike, or slow down. This gave them leverage at the bargaining table:
unlike capital assets, labor could refuse to be deployed  if conditions were untenable. Inalienability
also underlies many labor rights (the “inalienable rights of workers”  to have a say in conditions) and is
tied to human dignity – treating labor purely as a commodity is viewed as morally unacceptable.
Perishability (Temporal):  Labor is a perishable resource – a day’s labor not used is gone forever .
Each  worker’s  time  and  effort  are  available  only  in  the  present  and  cannot  be  stockpiled.  This
“temporal  perishability”  gave  labor  leverage  because  work  stoppages  impose  immediate  and
irretrievable losses on employers. For example, if workers strike for a week, that week’s production is
permanently lost – management cannot recover it later . This pressure tends to force employers to
negotiate to avoid sustained work stoppages. By contrast, capital (machines, inventory) can often sit
idle and be used later , but  idle labor time evaporates . Historically, this asymmetry was obvious:
factory owners faced mounting costs from halted assembly lines during strikes, whereas workers,
though also hurt by lost wages, knew that the cost to capital of lost production was irreversible .
Labor’s perishability thus underpinned tactics like strikes and slowdowns as effective leverage.
Heterogeneity (and Tacit Skill):  Labor is not a uniform commodity – skills, experience, and effort
quality  vary  greatly  from  person  to  person.  In  different  industries  and  eras,  certain  workers
possessed unique know-how or abilities that made them hard to replace. For instance, skilled craft
workers and engineers in early 20th-century industries had tacit knowledge of production processes
that employers depended on. Even unskilled labor has heterogeneity in the form of tacit coordination
and localized experience – a dockworker crew that knows the ins-and-outs of a port, or a team of
miners intimately familiar with a mine, cannot be swapped out overnight without loss of efficiency.
This heterogeneity gave groups of workers pivotal power  if their particular contribution was critical.
A historical example is the longshoremen (dockworkers) on the U.S. West Coast: they maintained
high  wages  even  as  shipping  mechanized,  in  part  because  their  union  controlled  a  scarce,
specialized labor pool for loading ships. In the 2010s, over half of West Coast longshore workers
earned  six-figure  salaries,  reflecting  the  union’s  enduring  bargaining  power  in  a  critical,  skill-
intensive chokepoint of global trade . More generally, employers have often found that replacing
an  experienced  workforce  with  new  hires  or  machines  entails  hidden  costs  and  inefficiencies,
especially  when  tacit  knowledge  (informal  on-the-job  expertise)  is  involved.  Thus,  labor’s
heterogeneity  –  each  person’s  labor  is  a  slightly  different  “product”  –  historically  prevented  a
complete commodification of work and allowed strategic groups of workers (skilled trades, key
sectors) to demand a premium or to resist exploitation.
Moral Legitimacy:  Labor movements have typically enjoyed a moral and political legitimacy in the
public sphere that other interest groups often lack. The idea that workers “deserve fair treatment and
a voice”  has deep ethical appeal – after all, it is labor that produces the wealth of nations. From
religious and philosophical teachings on the dignity of labor to modern human rights (e.g. the
United  Nations’  affirmation  of  workers’  rights),  there  has  been  broad  recognition  that  treating
workers well is a matter of justice. This moral high ground empowered labor politically. For example,
early 20th-century calls for “industrial democracy”  – giving workers a say in their workplace – were
framed as extensions of democratic rights and human dignity. Labor activists successfully argued• 
• 
1
•

that a just society required reciprocal obligations between labor and capital. As a result, many
governments acknowledged the moral legitimacy of labor’s claims , enacting labor protections and
negotiating  with  unions  as  representatives  of  the  working  class.  Even  in  strikes,  workers  often
garnered public sympathy (especially when opposed by abusive industrial barons), which pressured
elites to compromise. In short, labor’s agenda was seen not as special-interest pleading, but as
aligned with broader social justice – a crucial source of soft power .
Reciprocity  and  Interdependence:  The  relationship  between  workers  and  employers  has  an
inherent reciprocity: each depends on the other . Workers need wages to live, and employers need
labor to run their business. Historically, this mutual dependence created a potential for reciprocal
agreements  – a balance of give-and-take. When labor’s power was strong, the norm was that
productivity gains would be shared (higher profits for firms and higher wages/benefits for workers) –
a tacit social contract. For example, the post-WWII social contract  in the U.S. and Western Europe
involved workers accepting productivity-improving changes (like new machinery or processes) in
exchange for rising pay and job security, ensuring both sides benefited. If one side broke this
reciprocity  (e.g.  employers  tried  to  take  all  gains  as  profit,  or  workers  slowed  productivity
intentionally),  it  often  led  to  conflict.  Unions  and  collective  bargaining  can  be  seen  as
institutionalizing reciprocity: both labor and management make binding agreements that respect
each other’s needs (e.g. workers agree to no strikes during contract period, employers agree to fair
raises and conditions). Reciprocity was also enforced informally by solidarity – an injury to one is an
injury to all  was a common labor slogan, reflecting that workers expected fair and mutual support
from each other and from employers. This sense of fairness and interdependence was leverage
because  it  made  labor’s  demands  seem  reasonable  and  constrained  how  harshly  capital  could
respond  without  risking  broader  backlash.  In  essence,  employers  who  upheld  a  reciprocal
relationship  (treating  workers  as  partners  in  production)  often  saw  more  labor  peace  and
productivity, whereas those who didn’t faced unrest. Thus, reciprocity reinforced labor’s position by
anchoring it in a social norm of fairness.
Summary:  These six features made labor power “indispensable”  in the industrial era. Labor was everywhere
(universal), yet  could not be simply bought outright or stored  (inalienable and perishable), and it brought
human creativity and variation (heterogeneity) that gave it special value beyond any generic commodity.
Coupled with the moral narrative around workers’ rights and a reciprocal social contract ethic, labor was
able to translate its economic necessity into political and social influence. Across different countries and
eras, we see these principles at work: whether it was factory workers unionizing in England, independence
movements  rallying  peasants  and  workers  in  colonized  nations,  or  social  democratic  parties  creating
welfare states, the power of labor rested on these fundamental levers. 
However , as automation accelerates in the 21st century, many of these leverage points are under threat.
Robots and AI do not have “rights” or moral claims, nor do they need reciprocity – and if machines become a
substitute for human work, labor’s universality and indispensability diminish. This leads to the pressing
question:  what successor institutions or sources of power can ordinary people leverage in a post-
automation economy?  The next sections explore possible answers, evaluating how emerging institutions
might replicate the sixfold leverage that labor once held.•

Successor Institutions in a Post-Automation Economy
As economies become more automated and traditional jobs vanish or transform, society must identify new
bases  for  broad  economic  and  political  empowerment.  Several  proposals  have  emerged  for  “successor
institutions”  to  the  role  that  organized  labor  played  in  the  industrial  era.  These  include  data  unions,
ecological or land trusts, attention-sovereignty frameworks , and other innovative models for collective
ownership or governance of key resources. Each of these seeks to organize people around a different kind
of asset or leverage point (personal data, environmental commons, human attention, etc.) in order to
restore bargaining power and ensure fair distribution of wealth in a world where labor alone may not
suffice. Below, we evaluate each proposal in turn, examining real-world examples or case studies where
available,  and  analyze  how  well  they  reproduce  labor’s  six  leverage  factors  (universality,  inalienability,
perishability, heterogeneity, moral legitimacy, reciprocity).
Data Unions and Data Cooperatives
What is a Data Union?  A  data union  is a form of collective organization in which individuals pool their
personal  data  or  digital  contributions  and  act  as  a  unified  bargaining  entity  vis-à-vis  corporations  or
platforms. The concept, inspired by traditional labor unions, recognizes that in the digital economy users
generate valuable data (through their online behavior , content creation, sensor readings, etc.), but currently
have little control or reward for it. Data unions aim to change this by aggregating individuals’ data rights
and negotiating on their behalf – whether for  better privacy protections, compensation, or decision-
making power  over how data is used. For example, Glen Weyl and Jaron Lanier have proposed “Mediators of
Individual Data” (MIDs)  – entities that would represent people in selling or governing their data, much like a
union or guild. In practice, a data union could function as a cooperative or trust: members consent to share
certain  data  into  a  common  pool,  the  union  secures  deals  with  data  buyers  (or  advocates  for  policy
changes), and any benefits (revenues or rights) are distributed among members.
Emerging Examples:  Early prototypes of data unions and cooperatives are appearing. In Europe, projects
like MIDATA.coop  in Switzerland allow citizens to collectively store and control their health data, deciding
which  researchers  can  use  it  and  receiving  benefits  in  return.  Another  example  is  the  Driver’s  Seat
Cooperative  in the U.S., where rideshare drivers pool their driving data to gain insights and bargaining
power with ride-hailing platforms (and even sell anonymized data to city planners, returning proceeds to
drivers). The EU’s recent Data Governance Act (2022) explicitly encourages  data cooperatives  as  “data
intermediaries”  that help individuals exercise their data rights collectively. Academic and legal voices also
support data unions: a note in the California Law Review  envisions data unions as “democratically controlled
aggregated data pools that allow individuals to meaningfully control their data as a collective bargaining unit,”
aiming for “informational democracy”  analogous to industrial democracy. These unions are not merely about
monetizing data; importantly, they can also push for ethical data practices and prevent harms. For instance,
a data union could refuse to share data with a company unless it abides by privacy standards or could
collectively negotiate terms of algorithmic transparency.
Leverage Comparison – Data Unions vs. Labor:
Universality: Potentially  high,  but  with  gaps.  In  principle,  most  people  today  generate  data  (via
smartphones, internet use, smart devices, etc.), so the constituency for data unions is broad. In the
way that virtually everyone has labor power , virtually everyone in a digital society produces data
exhaust. This ubiquity  gives data unions a wide base – for example, a nation-scale data trust could• 
4
represent nearly all citizens. However , unlike labor (which even the poorest individual possesses),
access to data generation depends on technology use – billions of people are online, but some
marginalized groups (especially in developing regions) are not yet data producers at scale. So data
isn’t  quite  as  universal  as  labor  historically  was,  though  it  is  rapidly  becoming  so  with  global
connectivity.  Still,  as  a  leverage  point,  personal  data  could  involve  huge  numbers  of  people,
approaching labor’s universality.
Inalienability: Moderate,  depending  on  legal  design.  Currently,  personal  data  is often  treated  as
alienable – people click “I agree” and effectively surrender data to tech companies who then own or
control it. A key goal of data unions would be to restore inalienable rights  over data, treating data
as an extension of the person (a dignitarian  view) rather than a commodity to be freely bought and
sold. Some proposals advocate that data rights should be legally inalienable: for instance, individuals
could  always  retain  the  right  to  revoke  consent  to  use  their  data.  Indeed,  one  principle  of
“information self-determination”  is that people should be able to withdraw their data – akin to how
labor can withhold work. In a data union, members typically grant only limited, revocable licenses
to their data. The union might negotiate usage but individuals could exit the union and withdraw
future  data  contributions.  Technologies  like  distributed  ledgers  and  personal  data  stores  could
enable this by keeping an auditable trail of data uses and allowing permissions to be revoked. The
United Nations’ concept of  “Attention Sovereignty”  encapsulates this:  “Individuals should retain self-
determination, ownership, access and control of self-generated attention data... with the ability to revoke
access for any reason.” . Applied to personal data broadly, this ethos means data unions would
strive to make data not fully alienable , always tied to the individual’s ongoing consent. That said,
once data is copied or sold, it’s hard to fully retract what’s been learned from it (e.g. you can’t make
an AI unlearn  a pattern). So practical inalienability of data remains a challenge, but strong fiduciary
rules for data unions (where the union is obliged to act in members’ interest) can approximate it by
never permanently selling rights, only leasing or permitting uses under conditions.
Perishability: Low – data is non-perishable (both a strength and a weakness).  Unlike labor time, data
can be stored and reused indefinitely , which is the opposite of perishable. On one hand, this
means data unions don’t have the same immediate-leverage tactic as a strike (withholding data for a
day doesn’t “expire” the way skipping a day of work does, since the data from that day could be
captured later or inferred). However , data’s non-perishability also means that a valuable dataset,
once amassed, becomes a lasting asset for the union. For example, if a data union collectively
curates a large pool of high-quality data (say, medical records or user behavior data), that asset can
continue to generate value over time (through multiple analyses, AI training runs, etc.). The union
can threaten to deny future access  to its data asset if demands aren’t met – not as time-sensitive as a
labor strike, but still a credible form of power if the data pool is unique. In summary, data lacks the
ticking-clock pressure of labor , but it compensates by being a durable bargaining chip. The onus is
on  the  union  to  make  the  data  collectively  indispensable  (e.g.  a  platform’s  algorithms  might
significantly degrade if cut off from a large chunk of user data).
Heterogeneity: High  –  data  is  highly  heterogeneous  and  context-specific.  Personal  data  varies
enormously by type (financial data, health data, social media content, location traces, etc.) and
quality. A crucial insight is that  the value of data is often in aggregate patterns , not individual
points. Data unions leverage heterogeneity by pooling data from many individuals to reveal insights
that  no  single  person’s  data  could  provide.  This  is  akin  to  how  a  diverse  workforce’s  collective
knowledge exceeds one worker’s. Furthermore, certain individuals’ data might be especially valuable• 
2
• 
• 
5
(e.g. a person with a rare medical condition contributing to a health data pool). In that sense, each
person’s data is a unique “product” – not interchangeable – paralleling how each worker brought
unique skills. This can give bargaining power if, say, a data union of diabetes patients holds a dataset
that pharma companies highly desire; the union can negotiate terms collectively for access. Another
aspect  of  heterogeneity  is  tacit  knowledge  vs  explicit  data :  human  labor  had  tacit  elements,
whereas  data  tends  to  be  explicit  recordings.  However ,  interpreting  data  (e.g.  labeling  it,
contextualizing it) reintroduces a labor-like element. Some data cooperatives involve members in
curating  or  explaining  their  data,  effectively  injecting  human  knowledge  that  cannot  be  easily
replicated elsewhere. Overall, data unions benefit from heterogeneity because they can specialize –
one data union might corner the market for , say, ethically sourced driving telemetry data, another
for music listening habits, etc., each developing expertise and thus leverage in its niche.
Moral Legitimacy: Potentially high, but still emerging.  The idea that individuals should have rights
and share in the value of their personal data is increasingly framed as a moral issue. Just as labor
movements argued that it’s only fair for workers to get a just slice of the value they create, data
unions contend that users deserve  agency and dividends  in the data economy. There is growing
public concern over “surveillance capitalism” – corporations exploiting personal data without consent
or compensation – which gives moral weight to data sovereignty. Advocates liken data rights to
human rights, arguing that personal data is an extension of the person and thus deserves dignity
and protection. This dignitarian perspective can galvanize support for data unions as a means of
justice  and  autonomy ,  not  just  money.  Furthermore,  data  unions  can  highlight  discriminatory
harms  in  data  use  (for  instance,  algorithms  that  harm  marginalized  groups)  and  claim  moral
legitimacy in fighting those harms collectively. Policymakers and scholars (as cited above) talk about
“informational democracy” , suggesting a broad ethical principle that people should collectively govern
data about them. While data unions are a new concept to the general public, their alignment with
values of privacy, fairness, and consent gives them a solid ethical foundation that could translate
into  political  support  (similar  to  how  labor  unions  became  seen  as  defenders  of  the  common
worker). However , Big Tech companies may push back with their own narrative (e.g. that data flows
should be free for innovation), so the moral debate is ongoing. Overall, data unions have a strong
case to be seen as the rightful guardians of individual and community digital rights , which can
confer legitimacy to their demands.
Reciprocity: Moderate  –  requires  new  norms.  Unlike  the  clear  two-sided  dependency  of  labor  vs
capital, the reciprocity in data relationships is less established. Right now, tech platforms often
unilaterally take data in exchange for “free” services – an imbalanced arrangement. Data unions seek
to make this relationship more reciprocal : users will share data if and only if companies reciprocate
with fair value or practices. For example, a data union might collectively agree to provide data to a
research project only if the researchers share results with the community (mutual benefit), or they
might sell data to a company only if a fair revenue share or other benefit returns to members. In
essence, data unions can encode “we’ll give you our data if you treat us fairly” . This creates a new kind
of data contract. We see early signs of this: some firms have begun offering small payments for data,
and regulations like GDPR enforce a form of reciprocity by requiring consent and allowing opting
out.  A  union  strengthens  reciprocity  by  negotiating  as  a  group  so  that  each  member  gets  a
consistent deal (preventing companies from playing individuals against each other). Additionally,
within the union, there is an ethos of reciprocity: members pool their data for the common good and
share proceeds. This internal mutual aid mirrors the solidarity of labor unions. One could imagine,
for instance, a data union using part of its earnings to provide collective services to members (like• 
• 
6
identity theft protection or dividends to those who contributed most data), creating an ongoing
reciprocal bond. While the norms are nascent, if data unions become common, companies could
come to expect that using personal data involves a two-way exchange , not a one-way extraction – a
dynamic  much  closer  to  the  reciprocity  that  existed  (at  least  ideally)  in  robust  labor-capital
negotiations.
In summary, data unions  show promise in replicating many aspects of labor’s leverage. They harness the
universal  presence of data in our lives, strive to make data rights inalienable and subject to collective consent ,
capitalize on data’s heterogeneity and value in aggregation , and build a narrative of justice and reciprocity  in
the digital domain. They do face challenges – notably the fact that data can be copied (lack of perishability
means withholding data is a slower tactic than a labor strike) – but with supportive policy and technology
(discussed  in  the  next  section  on  blockchain),  data  unions  could  form  a  cornerstone  of  post-labor
empowerment. Some economists even talk of “data as labor”, implying that contributing data should be
seen as a form of work with commensurate rights. In practice, data unions are still in early stages (pilot
projects, legal frameworks evolving), but their trajectory suggests they could indeed carry forward a large
part of labor’s historical role: organizing people for collective economic agency.
Ecological and Land Trusts
What are Ecological/Land Trusts?  These refer to institutions that hold and manage natural resources or
land on behalf of a group (community, citizens, or even all humankind) with the aim of sustainable use and
equitable  benefit-sharing .  The  basic  idea  is  to  treat  elements  like  land,  water ,  forests,  minerals,  the
atmosphere, etc., not as privately owned commodities but as common wealth . A trust (often a legal trust or a
nonprofit entity) becomes the steward of these assets, preserving them and possibly generating revenue
(through regulated use or rents) that can be redistributed. This concept has deep historical roots – for
example, many indigenous communities managed land communally. In a modern context,  community
land trusts (CLTs)  are used to maintain affordable housing (the trust owns land and ensures housing on it
remains  accessible).  On  a  larger  scale,  proposals  for  sovereign  wealth  funds  or  “commons  trusts”
suggest that income from natural resources (oil, minerals) or environmental use (carbon emission permits)
be placed in trust for citizens. One real-world case is the  Alaska Permanent Fund : the state of Alaska
invests oil royalties into a fund and pays out annual dividends to every resident, effectively sharing resource
wealth in a quasi-trustee model.
In a post-automation economy, ecological and land trusts can serve as successor institutions by providing
people with income and power derived from  nature and common goods  rather than wages. They also
embody  the  principle  that  certain  vital  goods  (land,  clean  air,  biodiversity)  should  be  managed
democratically for future generations, not exploited by a few.  Environmental trusts can be local (e.g. a
town conservancy that owns land to prevent its overuse) or global (e.g. proposals for a global climate trust
that charges for carbon emissions and distributes the proceeds). Economist Peter Barnes, for instance, has
advocated for a Sky Trust  that would manage atmospheric carbon capacity as a property held by citizens,
who then receive dividends from polluters who pay into the trust.
Leverage Comparison – Ecological/Land Trusts vs. Labor:
Universality: Varies with design, but potentially very high.  If an ecological trust is set up at a national
or global level, its beneficiaries can be essentially everyone . For example, a national land trust might
declare that all citizens are equal co-beneficiaries of the nation’s natural resources . This mirrors• 
7
labor’s  universality  (everyone  works;  here,  everyone  shares  environment).  The  Alaska  Fund  is  a
concrete example: every Alaskan, rich or poor , gets an annual check – a universally shared benefit.
Universality gives such trusts political strength: it’s like every citizen holding a “stake” akin to being a
member of a giant union of resource owners. However , not all trusts are universal – some are
community-specific or regional. A local land trust benefits only the residents of that locality. Still, the
principle can scale. A global  ecological trust for , say, carbon emissions would conceptually include all
humans as beneficiaries (since climate is global commons). Universality was a major strength of
labor  (the  broad  working  class);  similarly,  tying  economic  benefits  to  universal  citizenship  or
humanity can create a powerful political constituency that expects and demands those dividends.
Inalienability: High  –  the  trust  structure  by  definition  holds  assets  inalienably.  In  a  well-designed
commons trust, the core assets (land, resource rights) are legally inalienable  – they cannot be sold
off for private gain; they are held in perpetuity for the beneficiaries. This is a direct parallel to labor’s
inalienability: just as one’s labor couldn’t be permanently seized, the trust ensures the commons
can’t be permanently lost to private ownership. For instance, a conservation land trust that acquires
a forest will often put it under easements or legal conditions that forbid future sale or destructive
exploitation – the forest is “locked in” as a commons. The trustees have a fiduciary duty to future
generations. This protects the asset from short-term market pressures, much like labor laws protect
certain rights regardless of market conditions. Moreover , individuals’ share in the trust (e.g. the right
to a dividend or to use a piece of community land) is usually not alienable either – you typically can’t
sell your “membership” in the commons for cash; it stays attached to your status (as a community
member or citizen). That ensures  ongoing collective ownership . Inalienability here is arguably
easier to enforce than with data, because physical and legal controls can prevent the sale of land or
resource rights. One could say the Earth’s gifts are inherently inalienable for humanity – an ethos
that many ecological movements stress.
Perishability: Moderate – some resources are renewable (perishable if unused), others are stock-like.
Natural resources have a mix of characteristics. For example, a forest’s capacity to grow timber each
year is a renewable yield – if not harvested, that growth accumulates (to a point) or could be lost to
natural decay; fisheries quotas not caught one year might mean more fish next year (or lost if fish
die naturally). In these cases, there is some  perishability: sustainable use often means use it or lose it .
A trust can decide to hold back usage to preserve the asset (in which case “lost” harvest might be
seen as investing in future bigger yields or simply as conservation). On the other hand, minerals like
oil left in the ground aren’t perishable year to year – they will wait (though market prices fluctuate).
The key leverage from a trust’s perspective is that it can control the flow  of use rights. For instance,
a land trust leasing farmland might say “this year we allow X acres to be farmed.” If potential lessees
(farmers  or  companies)  don’t  meet  the  trust’s  terms  (e.g.  offering  a  good  rent  or  following
environmental rules), the trust can withhold access. The immediate cost  to the trust is the lost rent for
that year (somewhat analogous to lost wages in a strike), and the asset (land) remains and can be
leased later . So the dynamic is different: trusts are not under as much time pressure as labor was
(land sitting unused for a year doesn’t disappear , whereas labor time does). This weaker perishability
means trusts have less urgency  in bargaining – they can wait out a bad deal without irreparable loss
in many cases (especially for non-renewables). In a way, this can be a strength: a national resource
fund could simply refuse to privatize or exploit a resource until terms are favorable, since the oil or
minerals underground act like a stored reserve. The flip side is that withholding usage doesn’t sting
the counterparty as sharply as a labor strike did – companies wanting to exploit a resource can look• 
• 
8
elsewhere or wait. Overall, perishability is not a major leverage point for commons trusts; instead,
their power is more from ownership and legal control of a finite resource, not from a ticking clock. 
Heterogeneity: High – natural and community assets are unique and varied.  Just as every type of labor
is different, every piece of land and every resource has unique qualities. Ecological trusts often
control heterogeneous assets : one trust might manage a watershed, another a city’s land, another
a mineral deposit. Even within one trust, there can be multiple uses (recreation, forestry, carbon
sequestration, etc.) to balance. This heterogeneity means that expertise and local knowledge matter
– the trustees and community develop tacit knowledge of how to manage the asset sustainably. This
is akin to skilled labor know-how. It also means trusts are not one-size-fits-all; each one can tailor
rules to its context, which can be an advantage in negotiations. For example, if a city land trust owns
various parcels, it can choose which to develop and which to keep green, using knowledge of the
community’s needs. A monolithic outside developer won’t have that nuance. In terms of leverage, if a
trust holds a  unique  resource (say the only port in a region, or a rare earth mineral deposit, or a
rainforest with biodiversity), it has a stronger position – outsiders must come to terms with the trust
to access that uniqueness. This mirrors how skilled workers in a unique craft had more leverage.
Additionally, because these trusts are often decentralized (many communities having their own),
there is diversity in approaches – some may find very successful models that can be replicated, akin
to how different unions experimented and learned.  Tacit cultural values  also play a role (e.g.
indigenous-managed  trusts  often  succeed  by  applying  traditional  ecological  knowledge).  In
summary, heterogeneity of resources means a network of trusts could cover a wide array of vital
needs,  collectively  replacing  the  broad  “portfolio”  of  things  labor  used  to  influence  (industry,
services, etc.) with an equally broad set of commons governance institutions.
Moral Legitimacy: Very high – appeals to fairness across generations and stewardship.  Ecological and
land trusts rest on powerful moral arguments. They claim to serve the common good and future
generations , which gives them a legitimacy beyond narrow economic calculus. The idea that  “the
land belongs to the people”  or that “we are only trustees for our children and their children”  resonates
across cultures. For instance, many constitutions and international declarations affirm that natural
resources should benefit the populace and be protected. When a trust fights against, say, a polluting
company or defends community land from speculators, it often has public opinion on its side, much
like workers striking against a cruel employer could rally sympathy. In the climate arena, youth
movements argue for a  “climate trust”  approach, essentially saying governments have a fiduciary
duty to protect the atmospheric commons for young and unborn people – a deeply moral framing.
Also, by distributing dividends or benefits broadly, these trusts address inequality, which is ethically
appealing: e.g. Alaska’s oil dividend is credited with reducing poverty and has broad support as a fair
share of wealth. The reciprocity  concept also ties in morally: those who profit from using common
resources  (like  oil  companies)  should  reciprocate  by  sharing  value  with  everyone.  This  fairness
principle is easy to grasp and champion. In political discourse, commons trusts are often portrayed
as correcting the injustices of enclosure or privatization. For example, the phrase “privatizing profits
and socializing costs”  (e.g. pollution) is criticized, and trusts are offered as the remedy – socialize the
ownership too, so profits are shared . Overall, ecological/land trusts can claim moral high ground as
guardians of both social equity and environmental responsibility . This high moral legitimacy can
translate into strong political mandates (e.g. a government establishing a national wealth fund due
to popular demand that resource riches be shared, as seen in several countries).•

Reciprocity: High  –  built  into  the  concept  of  a  trust.  By  design,  a  commons  trust  establishes  a
reciprocal relationship between stakeholders and the resource/benefit flow . The trust structure
imposes obligations on the trustees to manage responsibly and on beneficiaries (sometimes) to use
the resource wisely. For example, a community forest trust might allow locals to gather firewood or
food, but require they also participate in replanting or guarding against fires – a give-and-take
arrangement with the land. On the grander scale, trusts create reciprocity between citizens and the
state or companies: if a mining company wants to extract minerals, it must  give back  – perhaps
paying royalties into the trust that will be used for public good or ecological restoration. Similarly,
the  trust  gives  back  to  citizens  in  return  for  their  collective  “ownership”  of  the  resource  (via
dividends, public services funded by the trust, etc.). This mirrors the social contract of labor: both
sides contribute and benefit. There’s also a solidarity component: all beneficiaries are in it together
and agree on rules of use. One might think of it as an updated form of the commons systems of old,
where communities had norms like “each family can graze X cows on the commons, and must help
maintain the fences.” Modern trusts formalize this. Importantly, reciprocity extends across time –
current generations restrict their exploitation so future ones aren’t deprived, expecting that future
folks would have done the same for them. This long-term reciprocity is unique to ecological trusts
(labor’s reciprocity was mostly contemporaneous between workers and bosses, not generational). It
gives these institutions a kind of transcendent duty  that can be very compelling and can stabilize
their policies beyond short-term politics.
In summary,  ecological and land trusts  can serve as powerful equalizers in a post-automation era. By
ensuring that natural wealth and space (which even robots need to operate!) are controlled democratically,
they provide people with income (like dividends or free/cheap access to land) that is not tied to having a
job. They also give communities leverage over corporations – for instance, a community that owns its water
source can negotiate much better terms with a bottling company than if the resource was unowned or
privately held. In effect, these trusts make  “capital out of commons”  and distribute that capital’s returns
universally. They strongly replicate labor’s moral and political power (perhaps even exceeding it in moral
clarity) and can include everyone in their scope. While they don’t replicate the urgency of a strike, they
compensate by holding real assets that cannot easily be ignored or bypassed (you can offshore a factory to
avoid a union, but you cannot offshore a local mineral deposit or a local market of consumers receiving
trust dividends). Many scholars argue that as automation progresses, something like “universal property”
or  commons-based  income  will  be  necessary  to  maintain  social  stability  –  ecological  trusts  and  allied
institutions are prime candidates. Real-world momentum exists: besides Alaska, Norway’s sovereign wealth
fund (from North Sea oil) is an example on a national level, and there are increasing calls to treat data or
spectrum or other quasi-natural assets as public trusts as well.
Attention-Sovereignty Frameworks
What  is  Attention  Sovereignty?  The  modern  economy  increasingly  monetizes  human  attention  –
through advertising, engagement algorithms, and media. Companies like social media platforms and online
advertisers profit by capturing our eyeballs and time (often via addictive or manipulative tactics). Attention
sovereignty  is a framework that asserts individuals (and communities) should have control and ownership
over their own attention and the data generated from it. In other words, just as data unions focus on data,
attention-sovereignty focuses on the act of paying attention  as a scarce resource that we each possess. This
idea leads to proposals where people collectively negotiate how their attention is sold or used, or where
they are compensated for it. One concrete example is the  Brave Browser  and its Basic Attention Token
(BAT) system: users can choose to view privacy-respecting ads and are rewarded with a cryptocurrency (BAT)• 
10
as a share of the ad revenue – effectively paying users for their attention. That’s an early attempt to
establish that attention has value to be paid for, not just taken . Another angle is regulatory or rights-
based: proposing that people have the right to opt out of surveillance advertising, or even that they could
organize to set terms (e.g. a group of consumers agreeing to boycott or block ads unless advertisers meet
certain standards).
Attention-sovereignty frameworks  are less formally institutionalized than data unions or land trusts at
this point, but the concept is gaining traction. The United Nations has even discussed principles for a
“conscious  attention  economy,”  listing  Attention  Sovereignty  as  a  core  principle  (as  we  saw,  ensuring
individuals’ control and the ability to revoke access to their attention data) . Some envision  attention
cooperatives  that could collectively bargain with advertisers: for instance, a coop that represents a million
viewers could say “we will only allow ads that meet these quality criteria and pay at least $X per viewer .” This
would flip the script on the current ad industry. Additionally, initiatives around digital wellbeing and “time
well spent” (championed by tech ethicists like Tristan Harris) align with the idea of treating attention with
respect and user control.
Leverage Comparison – Attention Frameworks vs. Labor:
Universality: High – all conscious people have attention to give.  Attention is, in a sense, even more
universal than labor in that every waking moment we are paying attention to something. In the
digital age, billions of people’s attention is a commodity being fought over by tech giants. Everyone
with  a  device  or  an  internet  connection  is  a  potential  source  of  attention  revenue.  This
universality means any framework that empowers people regarding their attention could mobilize a
massive swath of the population. It doesn’t matter if you are employed or not – as long as you use a
phone, watch TV, or even walk past billboards, your attention is in play. Thus, an “Attention Union” (to
coin a phrase) could in theory include retirees, students, and others outside the labor force, giving
them a say in economic arrangements. This broad applicability is similar to how labor encompassed
all working-class people. A caveat: attention markets primarily target those with purchasing power
(advertisers value the attention of those who can buy their products). But even children’s attention is
monetized (think of ads on kids’ content) – albeit via their parents. So nearly everyone is in the
audience economy. Therefore, attention-sovereignty efforts have a truly universal constituency to
draw from.
Inalienability: Moderate – attention is inherently personal, but currently exploited via opaque means.
One’s attention, like labor , is tied to oneself; you can’t fully alienate it because you are always the one
who must pay attention. However , the outputs of attention (data about what you viewed, clicks,
engagement metrics)  are currently taken and traded without much control. The goal of attention
sovereignty  is  to  assert  that  your  attention  cannot  be  used  or  sold  without  your  ongoing
permission , making it akin to inalienable. In practice, this means mechanisms like the ability to opt
out of tracking, to revoke consent for targeted ads, or to charge a price for your attention. We see
early regulatory moves: e.g. Apple’s iOS changes ask users if they want to allow tracking for ads – the
majority say no, which is a form of reclaiming inalienability (advertisers can’t just take your attention
data without consent). If attention frameworks evolve, we might see attention licenses  that are time-
bound or revocable – for example, you agree to watch 5 minutes of ads per day in exchange for
some benefit, but you can cancel that agreement any time. Because attention is fleeting in time,
maintaining control over it means being able to withdraw from attention-exploiting systems at will.
Right now, addictive design undermines this (people get hooked and effectively lose control of their2
• 
• 
11
attention to algorithms). A sovereignty approach would treat manipulative capture of attention as
a violation , and any use of one’s attention as needing explicit, revocable agreement. Technologies
like ad-blockers, privacy settings, or paying for ad-free services are tools individuals use to keep their
attention  from  being  alienated.  A  collective  approach  could  demand  these  as  rights  or  even
collectively negotiate with content providers (e.g. a group of users saying we will only watch your
streaming service if you limit ads to X minutes per hour). Achieving true inalienability will require
stronger  legal  protections  (perhaps  treating  attention  data  similar  to  personal  data  rights)  and
collective bargaining clout to resist the subtle ways companies try to seize attention. It’s challenging
but conceivable, given rising public awareness of the issue.
Perishability: High – attention is extremely perishable, moment to moment.  Attention might be the
most perishable resource of all. An unwatched ad impression is instantly lost value  – if no one is
looking at that banner or that TV commercial at a given second, the opportunity is gone. This gives
individuals or collectives a potentially  strong leverage : simply by  not paying attention , they deny
value to advertisers and platforms. In effect, every second of attention not captured is a tiny “strike.”
For example, widespread adoption of ad-skipping or ad-blocking technology has spurred companies
to  find  new  ways  to  reach  people,  indicating  that  collectively,  consumers  can  push  back.  If  an
organized movement encouraged people to reclaim their time (say, a coordinated “digital detox
hour” where millions log off social media in protest of certain policies), it directly hits the platforms’
ad revenues for that period. The perishability here is similar to labor: if an eyeball is not on an ad at a
given time, you can’t double up attention later to make it up – advertisers have very time-bound
campaigns and budgets. In fact, the attention economy is measured in  seconds  and  click-through
rates  – it’s highly time-sensitive. This suggests that attention sovereignty could use tactics analogous
to strikes or work slowdowns: e.g. collective boycotts of certain media, or browser extensions that
intentionally obfuscate tracking (denying quality attention data). Already we see something like this
in how users install tracker blockers, which “waste” the data collection attempts of advertisers. One
could imagine more explicit collective actions: an “attention strike” where users agree to not engage
with a certain platform for a day to demand changes. Because attention is so perishable, even a
short action can send a sharp message (advertisers notice a dip in engagement immediately). Thus,
this is a strong point of leverage, perhaps even stronger than labor’s perishability, because modern
businesses like Facebook or Google live and die by continuous engagement metrics – if users en
masse tune out, even briefly, Wall Street notices.
Heterogeneity: Moderate – attention from different audiences varies in value.  Not all attention is equal
from  an  economic  standpoint:  advertisers  covet  certain  demographics  or  contexts  more  (e.g.  a
minute of a wealthy consumer’s attention is worth more to marketers than a minute of a low-income
person’s,  which  is  an  unfortunate  fact).  Also,  attention  in  different  contexts  (focused  attention
watching a video vs. half-attention scrolling a feed) has different qualities. This heterogeneity could
be leveraged by attention-sovereignty frameworks: for instance, professional cohorts or interest
groups could form attention unions  where their specific attention is particularly desirable. Think of an
“Attention Cooperative of CTOs” who agree not to attend any vendor webinars unless those vendors
meet privacy standards – since tech vendors really want CTO eyeballs, this coop has clout. Similarly,
regional or language-specific attention pools could negotiate with advertisers wanting to reach
those audiences. There is also a tacit element – people have subjective, qualitative experiences
that no algorithm fully captures. Human curation of attention (like a community deciding which ads
are acceptable) can produce a more engaged, genuine attention than spammy ads do. That quality
of attention is heterogeneous and potentially a bargaining asset: platforms that respect users might• 
• 
12
get more loyal attention, which is more valuable long-term. In essence, treating attention as a
homogeneous  mass  has  led  to  the  problematic  ad-tech  environment;  an  attention-sovereign
approach  might  differentiate  between  voluntary,  high-quality  attention  and  coerced,  low-quality
attention , and charge premium for the former . That said, individual attention is inherently ephemeral
and substitutable to a degree (advertisers can shift to whoever will look, if one group won’t). So the
heterogeneity isn’t as protective as a unique skill is in labor . It’s more about group differentiation and
context.  Overall,  while  not  a  primary  source  of  power ,  there  is  some  scope  for  leveraging  the
differences  in  attention’s  value  to  ensure  those  contributing  the  most  valuable  attention  (for
example, content creators who draw others’ attention, or influential community members) have a
say in how it’s monetized.
Moral Legitimacy: High and rising – linked to well-being and rights.  The fight for control of attention is
often framed in moral terms: protecting mental health, autonomy, and truth in society. The public is
increasingly aware of the harms of an extractive attention economy – from social media addiction to
the spread of disinformation and the erosion of privacy. Therefore, a movement that demands
“Attention Sovereignty”  can claim to be championing fundamental human needs: the need to not be
constantly manipulated and distracted, the right to one’s cognitive liberty. Indeed, there is an ethical
argument that over-harvesting attention without consent  is a violation akin to exploitation of labor . One
might say, just as child labor and sweatshops became moral issues, now  exploitative attention-
harvesting (especially of children or vulnerable groups) is seen as morally wrong . This confers
legitimacy to those pushing for reform. Governments are starting to respond (e.g. discussing bans
on addictive “dark patterns” in apps, or requiring transparency in how algorithms curate content).
From a political perspective, nearly every parent, teacher , or mental health professional would agree
that we must protect people’s attention and agency – thus, collective frameworks to do so could gain
broad support. The narrative of reclaiming our time  or “taking back control from Big Tech”  has populist
appeal.  Moral  legitimacy  also  stems  from  the  reciprocity  idea:  people  feel  it’s  only  fair  that  if
companies profit from our attention, we should benefit too or at least consent to how it’s done. The
notion of “the attention economy should be fair and conscious”  carries a normative weight. As
evidence of harm mounts (for example, Facebook’s own research on Instagram’s negative effect on
teens’ mental health became a scandal), the moral case strengthens for an overhaul where users are
not just products, but empowered stakeholders . So attention-sovereignty efforts can ride a wave of
ethical concern similar to how labor rights did during the early Industrial Age when harsh conditions
were exposed.
Reciprocity: Emerging – aiming to rebuild a fair exchange.  Today’s attention market is largely one-
sided: users get free content or services, and in exchange their attention (and data) is sold – but this
exchange is opaque and often not truly consensual. An attention-sovereignty framework would seek
to make this an  explicit reciprocal deal :  “I will give you my attention if you give me something of
commensurate value (money, service, knowledge) and respect my boundaries.”  Some early examples:
Brave’s BAT basically pays users for attention – that’s a reciprocal payment. Another is the Australian
law that forced Facebook and Google to pay news publishers for content: indirectly, that recognizes
the  attention  news  media  bring  to  platforms  and  enforces  reciprocity  (the  platforms  must
compensate  for  the  attention  that  news  content  attracts  to  their  sites).  In  a  collective  sense,
reciprocity could mean communities negotiate attention use: e.g. a smart city could say “we allow
digital billboards in our public square only if the advertising revenue goes partly into a community
fund,  and  only  if  ads  meet  community  standards.”  That’s  a  reciprocal  arrangement  instead  of
unilateral corporate ad intrusion. Over time, if such practices spread, companies would know they• 
• 
13
must  give value to get attention  – whether that value is better content, payment, or societal
contribution. This is akin to employers learning they had to give fair wages to get labor . One can
imagine attention coops where members collectively decide which advertisers or content creators to
support (like Patreon or collective subscription models are a mild version – users voluntarily pay for
content they like instead of having their attention sold). This fosters a more mutual relationship:
creators  get  rewarded,  and  consumers  get  content  without  exploitation.  It’s  still  early,  but  the
principle of reciprocity is at the heart of slogans like “If you’re not paying for the product, you are the
product”  – which implies maybe we should  be paying or be paid to balance things. As awareness of
that grows, new norms could indeed require that attention is not taken for granted. Thus, attention-
sovereignty can reintroduce a social contract  between users and services: respect our attention and
we will engage; abuse it and we withdraw it.
In summary,  attention-sovereignty frameworks  aim to empower individuals in one of the most crucial
and contested territories of the digital age – the battle for our mindshare. While still nascent in institutional
form,  the  combination  of  widespread  discontent  with  the  status  quo  and  the  inherent  leverage  of
attention’s  perishability  could  make  this  a  significant  pillar  of  post-automation  empowerment.  If  work
incomes  dwindle,  companies  will  increasingly  monetize  consumption  and  attention,  so  turning  that
dynamic into one where people collectively bargain could ensure we don’t just become passive targets of a
new form of exploitation. Attention unions or cooperatives, backed by ethical and perhaps legal recognition
of attention rights, might become as important in the 21st century as labor unions were in the 20th.
Other Emerging Alternatives: Social Wealth Funds and Platform Co-ops
Beyond the three categories above, there are other notable proposals to equip people with economic power
as  automation  advances.  We  highlight  two:  social  wealth  funds  (universal  capital  ownership)  and
platform cooperatives .
Social Wealth Funds (Universal Basic Capital):  This idea is to collectively own a diversified portfolio of
capital assets (stocks, real estate, intellectual property, etc.) on behalf of the public, and use the returns to
provide an income floor or citizens’ dividend. Essentially, it’s a way for  everyone to become a capitalist
without individually having wealth to invest  – the fund (often state-run or community-run) accumulates
assets over time (through taxes, sovereign investments, etc.) and then shares the proceeds. This concept
has  gained  attention  as  a  remedy  for  inequality  and  the  prospect  of  jobless  growth.  For  example,
economists have proposed that revenue from taxing automation or tech monopolies could feed a social
wealth fund. Norway’s oil fund  and other sovereign wealth funds are precedents, though not all pay direct
dividends. One bold proposal in the U.S. is to create a national social wealth fund that issues every citizen an
equal share, effectively giving each person a stake in the nation’s capital stock. This would mean that as
robots and AI generate more profits, those profits flow back to people in the form of dividends, rather than
only to a few owners. It’s been described as creating a “universal basic income funded by returns on capital” , or
a way to “own the robots”  indirectly. Notably, Alaska’s fund is a small-scale example: it’s essentially a state-
owned wealth fund that pays out to individuals, cushioning the impact of economic shifts (in Alaska’s case,
oil booms and busts).
From a  leverage  perspective, a social wealth fund gives people collective clout as shareholders. If large
enough, the fund can influence corporate governance (acting as a block of public ownership voting for
socially beneficial practices). And the dividends give individuals economic security  that can empower them
14
to refuse bad jobs or pursue education (improving labor’s fallback position even in a high automation
scenario). It replicates labor’s idea of broad-based prosperity: instead of wages, it’s shared capital returns.
To map it to the six features: - Universality: Ideally yes, every citizen gets a share (like universality of labor). -
Inalienability: Shares might be non-tradable to keep ownership equal and permanent (you can’t sell your
stake, similar to inalienable labor rights). - Perishability: Capital income is not perishable day-to-day, but one
could say dividends not claimed in a year might expire (or be smaller if economy dips). Less relevant,
though the fund needs continuous management. - Heterogeneity: The fund holds diverse assets (like an
economy-wide  portfolio),  hedging  like  a  collective  “index  fund”  –  this  diversity  is  strength  but  not
heterogeneous in the personal sense. - Moral legitimacy: Strong in terms of fairness – it addresses the
moral  claim  that  everyone  should  benefit  from  national/global  wealth,  not  just  capital  owners.  It’s  a
“socialist answer” to automation, as one commentary put it. - Reciprocity: It’s more of a redistribution
mechanism, but one could frame it as reciprocity between tech/capital and society – if you use our markets/
resources, you give back via the fund. 
Implementations are being explored: for example, Singapore’s Central Provident Fund and other public
investment schemes, although not universal in the sense of equal shares for all, show governments acting
as collective investors. If automation keeps displacing work, pressure may grow for such funds to provide
income. One risk is political control – unlike grassroots unions, a state-run fund could be mismanaged. But
with democratic governance and transparency, it could become a pillar of the social safety net,  reducing
individuals’ dependence on selling labor  and thus complementing diminished labor power .
Platform Cooperatives:  While labor unions traditionally negotiate with employers, platform cooperatives
are the employer (and platform) owned by workers/users themselves. In the gig and digital economy,
platform co-ops  offer a way for workers to collectively own the apps and marketplaces they rely on, instead
of being at the mercy of tech companies. For example, drivers could create a ride-hailing app cooperative to
compete with Uber , or freelance artists could cooperatively run a marketplace for their work. These co-ops
combine cooperative business models (one member , one vote governance, profit-sharing) with modern
technology platforms. In a post-automation context, many service jobs that remain (like care work, creative
work, artisanal services) might be mediated by platforms – ensuring those platforms are cooperatively
owned can preserve worker/community control and income. 
Platform  co-ops  address  labor’s  leverage  by  design:  they  bypass  the  traditional  capital-vs-labor  conflict
because the users and providers of the service  are the owners. They carry forward labor’s principles of
democratic  governance  and  reciprocity  into  the  digital  marketplace.  For  instance,  Up  &  Go  is  a
cooperative of house cleaners in New York that runs a shared booking platform – it charges lower fees than
corporate apps and returns more money to the cleaners, who also vote on business decisions. Another
example is Resonate , a co-op music streaming service owned by artists and listeners, aiming to pay artists
better than Spotify. While platform co-ops face the challenge of competing with venture-capital-fueled
giants, they have the advantage of trust and loyalty  from participants, and they avoid the extractive fees
that investor-owned platforms demand. 
In terms of the six features: - Universality: Applicable to many sectors, but each co-op is typically specific to
an industry or locality, so not universal in membership (though the idea is universal – anyone could form
one  in  their  domain).  -  Inalienability:  Members’  ownership  stakes  are  often  not  tradable  (preserving
cooperative control), and one’s work is inherently one’s own, respected by the co-op model (no selling your
digital labor outright). - Perishability: Co-op workers can still strike or withhold work if needed, but since
15
they own the platform, conflicts are internal – more about self-management. Less relevant except that they
remove the scenario of an external boss exploiting perishable labor . - Heterogeneity: Co-ops can tailor
services to community needs (a heterogeneous approach vs one-size platforms). Also, they often celebrate
the individuality of providers more than gig platforms do. - Moral legitimacy: High – cooperatives have long
been seen as ethically positive, empowering communities and preventing exploitation. Platform co-ops
inherit that goodwill, presenting themselves as the fair alternative  to gig-economy exploitation. - Reciprocity:
Fundamental – all stakeholders share in decision and profits, aligning interests rather than adversarial. For
example, a co-op ride-share might distribute surplus to driver-members or invest in better services, rather
than siphoning it to outside investors. 
Platform co-ops thus carry forward the spirit of the labor movement into the digital age , focusing on
collective ownership  rather than collective bargaining. They don’t solve the issue of jobs vanishing due to
automation, but they ensure that the jobs or gigs that do exist remain under worker control. They could also
interface  with  other  institutions:  e.g.  a  data  cooperative  could  be  run  as  a  co-op  of  the  individuals
contributing  data  (this  overlaps  with  data  unions  idea).  Indeed,  new  legal  forms,  like  the  Limited
Cooperative Association (LCA)  in certain U.S. states (e.g. Colorado), are enabling such hybrid co-ops that
can include multiple stakeholder classes (workers, users, investors) under a democratic structure. DAOs
(decentralized  autonomous  organizations)  in  the  blockchain  world  often  resemble  co-ops  and  are
experimenting with these models too (more on that next).
In conclusion, a mosaic of successor institutions  – data unions, commons trusts, attention cooperatives,
social wealth funds, platform co-ops, and others – may collectively substitute and even expand upon the
sixfold leverage that labor once provided. Each has strengths and weaknesses with respect to universality,
moral force, etc., but together they point to a future where power is derived not solely from one’s job, but
from one’s  participation in collective assets and digital communities . The final piece of the puzzle is how to
implement and scale these institutions. This is where technology (particularly blockchain and related digital
infrastructures) and innovative legal frameworks become crucial, as discussed next.
The Role of Blockchain and Digital Technology in Enabling New
Collective Power
Transitioning to these new institutions of economic power will require robust technical and institutional
support . Blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies offer a toolkit of unique affordances  that can
help build trustworthy, large-scale cooperative structures. In tandem with supportive legal frameworks (like
modern cooperative laws and DAO-recognition statutes), technology can provide the governance rails and
enforcement mechanisms  for data unions, commons trusts, and other collective arrangements. Here, we
analyze several key affordances –  revocability, consensus enforcement, auditability, and democratic
governance  – and how specific blockchain protocols and designs (such as Ethereum, Filecoin, Polkadot,
Cosmos,  etc.)  exemplify  or  support  these  features.  We  also  touch  on  legal  wrappers  like  Limited
Cooperative Associations (LCAs)  that bridge decentralized organizations with real-world law.
Revocability and Individual Control
One challenge in collective systems (be it a data union or an attention coop) is allowing individuals to
participate without irrevocably giving up their rights. Blockchain-based identity and consent systems  can
enable revocability – the ability for a person to  take back  their data or permissions. For example, using
16
smart contracts, a data union could issue a personal data license token to companies that grants usage
under certain terms and auto-expires after a time unless renewed. If a member withdraws, the smart
contract  can  prevent  any  further  access  to  that  member’s  data.  Projects  in  the  Ethereum  ecosystem
focusing on self-sovereign identity (SSI) and decentralized consent illustrate this: a user could provide a
platform with a cryptographic token that represents their consent to use data, and they can later revoke
(invalidate) that token, cutting off access. This is aligned with the Attention Sovereignty  principle of being able
to *“revoke access for any reason” , and blockchain provides a transparent, programmable way to do it.
Another aspect is personal data stores  or pods (like Tim Berners-Lee’s SOLID project) which can integrate
with blockchain for access control. Imagine a data trust where each member’s data is encrypted, and only a
smart contract holding aggregate keys can decrypt it for authorized uses. If the member leaves, the key can
be shredded (or their portion removed) – something auditable thanks to the ledger . While not trivial to
implement (revocation in practice can be hard if data was copied off-chain), the ledger can at least record
and enforce policies like deletion requests or paid usage periods.
In blockchain-based content platforms (for attention), NFTs (non-fungible tokens) might serve as revocable
licenses to one’s creative work or even to one’s attention. For instance, one could “rent out” a slice of their
screen real-estate via an NFT that an advertiser holds, but the NFT could be programmed to return to the
owner after a week. This level of fine-grained control simply isn’t possible in Web2 systems governed by
opaque corporate databases.
Some protocols natively emphasize user control. Filecoin , for example, is a decentralized storage network
where clients can choose to stop renewing a storage deal, effectively revoking  the continued storage of their
data after the contract ends. This is simpler than revoking data already copied, but it shows how blockchain
networks put control in the hands of users cryptographically. Filecoin is also exploring retrieval markets
where data providers can condition access – potentially allowing future scenarios like a data cooperative
storing its files on Filecoin and only granting decryption keys to those who comply with its terms, with all
actions (storage proofs, access requests) logged.
In summary, blockchain gives us programmable revocability : you can encode the right to withdraw or modify
consent into the system itself. This is crucial for inalienability: it ensures any contribution to a collective is
not a one-way door . Whether through smart contracts on Ethereum  or permission logic in newer chains,
individuals can participate in collective bargaining without surrendering permanent control – the code can
guarantee their right to exit, analogous to how labor laws guarantee one can quit a job (but in this case
enforced by code, not just law).
Consensus Enforcement and Automated Trust
A major advantage of blockchains is that they can enforce agreed-upon rules  without relying on any
single party’s discretion . This consensus enforcement  is vital for ensuring all members of a cooperative or
union trust the system. In a traditional organization, members have to trust leaders or third parties to carry
out decisions (with risk of corruption or error). In a blockchain-based DAO or cooperative, the core rules
(like how funds are distributed, how votes are counted) are executed by smart contracts that all nodes
verify. This dramatically reduces the principal-agent problem : for instance, if a data union smart contract says
“pay 70% of revenue to members proportionate to data contributed,” no CEO can decide otherwise – the
code will do it automatically, and all members can see it.2
17
Protocols like  Ethereum  pioneered this concept with DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations).
Although  early  high-profile  failures  (e.g.  The  DAO  hack  in  2016)  showed  risks,  today  we  have  many
successful  DAO  treasuries  and  governance  processes  running  on  Ethereum  and  layer-2  networks,
managing billions in assets with rules enforced on-chain. For example,  GitcoinDAO  manages funds for
open-source grants via community votes executed by smart contracts – when the community approves a
grant round, the contract disburses funds trustlessly. A similar approach could be used by a social wealth
fund:  imagine  a  national  wealth  fund  where  spending  decisions  are  encoded  as  proposals  and
automatically implemented once approved, removing possibilities of funds being siphoned off, since every
token movement is tracked and requires a blockchain-logged vote.
Another example is Polkadot , a blockchain ecosystem that has on-chain governance to even upgrade its
own protocol. Polkadot’s governance system (recently evolved into “OpenGov”) allows token holders to
propose changes and, if they reach the required approval and support thresholds, the blockchain protocol
automatically updates itself  in the enactment period. This is consensus enforcement of collective decisions
at the deepest level – no central authority needed to implement a new rule; the network’s consensus does
it. Such technology can be directly applied to cooperative institutions: rules can be transparently changed
by  member  vote  and  then  immediately  enforced  by  the  smart  contracts.  This  ensures  the  reciprocity
agreements and other terms the collective relies on cannot be unilaterally broken. It’s like having a built-in,
incorruptible contract enforcement officer .
Filecoin  also showcases consensus enforcement in a different way: it uses cryptographic proofs (like Proof-
of-Replication and Proof-of-Spacetime) to ensure storage providers actually store data as agreed. These
proofs are verified by the network’s consensus, and if a miner fails (consensus sees missing proof), they lose
collateral or rewards. Translating that concept, a data union using a similar mechanism could require any
data user to post a “bond” and cryptographically prove compliance (for instance, prove they deleted data
after usage) or lose the bond. While proving deletion is hard, creative approaches like zero-knowledge
proofs might emerge to enforce aspects of data usage policies. The general point: blockchains can make
cheating  collectively  agreed  rules  expensive  or  impossible .  This  is  exactly  what  you  need  for  large-scale
cooperation without a strong central enforcer .
Cosmos , with its app-chain model, allows communities to launch their own blockchains with custom logic.
For example, a community land trust could have its own Cosmos-based chain where the consensus rules
encode that land parcels can only be transferred according to trust charter (say, require 2/3 community vote
to approve a sale, otherwise transactions won’t go through). By being a sovereign chain, they can enforce
very specific rules at consensus level. Cosmos also supports inter-chain communication (IBC), so these
specialized chains can interact (e.g. a data co-op chain can interoperate with a payments chain to pay
dividends).
In summary, consensus enforcement by code ensures that agreements don’t depend on goodwill alone  – they
are backed by mathematics. This builds confidence among participants and even external partners (who
know the rules are transparent and binding). It lowers the need for costly intermediaries (no need for as
many auditors or escrow agents when the blockchain itself audits and escrows). For successor institutions,
this means a data union DAO  could automatically enforce that any data sale revenue is split 80/20 between
members  and  the  union’s  treasury,  or  an  attention  token  system  could  automatically  distribute  ad
revenue to viewers and content creators per agreed formulas, with no delays or excuses.
18
Auditability and Transparency
Blockchain  ledgers  are  append-only  and  transparent  (at  least  to  participants,  and  in  public  chains  to
everyone). This creates a reliable audit trail of all transactions and decisions. In the context of our new
institutions,  auditability  addresses  the  critical  issue  of  trust:  members  need  to  trust  that  their
representatives or the algorithms are doing what they should, and outside observers (including regulators
or the public) may also require assurance that, say, a commons trust isn’t being mismanaged.
By recording key actions on-chain, we achieve an immutable log . For instance: - A data union can record
on-chain every time data is accessed or sold (perhaps not the data itself, but a hash or a pointer to an
event). Members could inspect this log to see who used their collective data and whether proper payment
was made. If combined with techniques like zero-knowledge proofs, even privacy-sensitive info can be
audited in aggregate (e.g. proving that no unauthorized access happened without revealing the data). - A
social wealth fund’s investments could be tokenized – each asset it owns could be represented as tokens,
and all trades or votes that the fund makes would be on-chain records. Citizens could thus track the portfolio
in real-time . Compare this to traditional pension funds or sovereign funds where one must rely on periodic
reports; a blockchain-based fund could offer continuous transparency, deterring corruption. - Land trusts
could use blockchain registries for land titles or usage rights. Projects like Ethereum-based land registries
have been tested in some countries to reduce fraud. In a commons scenario, every lease of land, every
grant of resource extraction, can be logged, and the rules (like requiring community approval for certain
deals) can be verified by looking at the transaction history (e.g. “this timber contract was accompanied by
transaction X which is the community’s multi-sig approval”). 
Filecoin  provides auditability of storage – every block contains proofs that can be checked, creating a public
record of who stored what data when (in encrypted form). This is useful if a data trust wants to ensure data
is being stored redundantly by different parties (you can audit that files indeed have 3 replicas, etc.). Other
projects, like Carbon credit tracking on blockchains  (e.g. Toucan protocol on Polygon, or Climate Action
Data  Trust  using  a  blockchain-based  metadata  system),  aim  to  make  environmental  asset  usage
transparent. A global climate trust could plug into such systems to audit emissions and credits in an open
way.
Auditability is closely tied with  moral legitimacy : when funds and decisions are transparently handled,
stakeholders are more likely to believe the institution is acting in good faith, which is crucial for collective
buy-in. Furthermore, external auditors (like NGOs or government watchdogs) can easily verify compliance.
For example, if a data union promises it will not sell personal identifiers, an auditor could examine the
smart contract code and logs to ensure only aggregated anonymized data was traded. Or if an attention
cooperative sets a rule that no more than 5% of its ad inventory can be political ads, the logs could be
analyzed to confirm compliance.
That said, transparency has to be balanced with privacy. Blockchain’s public nature means solutions often
involve encrypting data and only putting hashes or proofs on-chain. Emerging tech like  zero-knowledge
proofs (ZKP)  can square this circle: prove to the chain that rules were followed without revealing underlying
private info. For instance, a ZKP could prove “the total dividend payout equals 100% of revenue” without
revealing  individual  identities  of  recipients.  This  field  is  growing,  with  protocols  like  Zcash,  Aztec,  or
StarkNet enabling selective transparency.
19
In  summary,  blockchains  can  serve  as  the  books  and  records  of  our  new  institutions ,  but  unlike
traditional ledgers, these books are distributed and tamper-proof. Every member becomes, in effect, an
auditor with the tools to verify that promises are kept. This fosters trust and can also help scale these
models because potential supporters (like governments or large NGOs) will be more willing to channel
resources to, say, a global commons trust if they know its operations are transparently governed on-chain.
Democratic Governance and Inclusive Decision-Making
Perhaps the most transformative affordance of blockchain for these institutions is the ability to implement
democratic  governance  at  scale .  This  means  moving  beyond  shareholder-weighted  voting  (which
traditional corporations and even some blockchain protocols use) toward systems that can reflect one-
person-one-vote  or  other  inclusive  models  in  a  secure  and  efficient  way.  In  labor  unions  and  co-ops,
democratic  participation  is  core  but  often  limited  by  practical  constraints  (e.g.  geographical  meeting
requirements,  low  turnout  in  ballots,  etc.).  With  digital  tools,  especially  decentralized  ones,  we  can
dramatically broaden participation.
Ethereum  itself doesn’t enforce how DApps do governance – many token-based projects default to coin
voting  (which  is  plutocratic).  However ,  we  are  seeing  experiments  in  quadratic  voting  and  quadratic
funding  (e.g.  Gitcoin’s  democratic  funding  of  grants)  which  weight  votes  differently  to  favor  broader
consensus rather than just big holders. These experiments often use Ethereum smart contracts to collect
votes, compute outcomes, and even to distribute matching funds in quadratic funding (where the number
of people contributing matters more than the amount). This kind of mechanism could be utilized in data
unions, for instance, to have members vote on which advocacy issue to focus on – quadratic voting would
ensure that a choice with broader , albeit maybe less intense, support could win over one pushed by a small
group of power users.
Polkadot  and Cosmos  both have interesting governance features. Polkadot’s OpenGov has multiple tracks
for different proposal types and allows delegation of votes if one wishes. While Polkadot’s voting is still
weighted by token stake (which might be fine for a public infrastructure like a blockchain), a cooperative
could fork similar frameworks but assign voting power per member (identity-based) rather than per token.
The substrate framework (used in Polkadot parachains) is flexible enough to allow custom voting modules.
For example, a data cooperative chain could require that each verified member address has equal voting
weight, possibly verified by a decentralized identity system to prevent Sybil attacks (fake members). We see
the beginnings of this with projects like BrightID and Proof-of-Humanity on Ethereum – providing a way to
certify unique persons without centralized ID, enabling one-person-one-vote DAOs.
Cosmos  chains like Regen Network  are essentially cooperatives of ecological stakeholders – they govern
carbon  credit  methodologies  and  approvals  via  on-chain  votes  (here  token-weighted,  but  the  token  is
somewhat distributed among stakeholders like scientists, project developers, etc.).  Joystream  (a cosmos-
based project) is a user-governed video platform where users vote on platform rules and moderate content
collectively. These are early examples of how on-chain governance can mimic or even enhance democratic
practices.  Votes  can  be  tallied  within  seconds  to  days,  and  results  enacted  automatically.  There’s  also
continuous governance: proposals can be made anytime (as opposed to annual general meetings only).
Importantly, blockchain governance can incorporate accountability  directly. For instance, DAO frameworks
allow the community to recall elected delegates or multi-sig signers  by a vote, which is akin to a union
recalling its leaders but easier to execute and transparent. Funds can be put behind time-locks so that if a
20
treasury transfer is initiated (say, paying developers or an external partner), members have a window to
veto if it violates the agreed budget.
Additionally,  blockchains  enable  global  participation  without  a  heavy  apparatus.  A  data  union  could
include members from many countries all voting on the same platform with low friction (just a wallet app).
This is crucial for global digital cooperatives or climate trusts that inherently span borders. Traditional
organizations would struggle with cross-border voting (different legal systems, etc.), but a well-designed
DAO can be borderless, relying on cryptographic membership proofs rather than national ID.
One must note, technology doesn’t automatically solve governance problems – people can still be apathetic
or form cliques. But it lowers barriers and provides novel tools (like liquid democracy , where you can either
vote directly or delegate your vote to someone you trust for each issue, and change delegation anytime).
Some DAOs are using liquid democracy via blockchain (e.g. Tezos had a form of delegate voting in its on-
chain votes).
To tie in the  legal wrappers : While blockchain handles internal governance, legal recognition of these
groups is important for interacting with traditional economy (signing contracts, owning real-world assets).
That’s where models like the Limited Cooperative Association (LCA)  in the U.S. come in. The LCA is a legal
form  that  accommodates  cooperative  principles  (member  voting,  profit-sharing)  while  allowing  some
investor involvement, created by the Uniform Law Commission. It has been specifically cited as a good fit
for DAO-like entities because it provides flexibility and clarity: a DAO could register as an LCA to get legal
personhood and limited liability for members, while still running its governance and operations via smart
contracts. The Colorado Cooperative Law is at the forefront here – some crypto projects (like the mentioned
Opolis , a digital employment cooperative) use the LCA to wrap their DAO. This hybrid approach marries code
governance with legal enforceability in courts if needed. It’s an active area: the UK has its Co-operatives UK
exploring how DAO principles can update coop law, and some jurisdictions (like Wyoming with its DAO LLC
law) are creating new entity forms specifically for blockchain communities.
In effect, the technology enables trust-minimized, scalable democracy , and the law can provide a bridge
to the off-chain world. Together , they address one of the hardest problems of collective action: how to
organize large groups fairly, efficiently, and in a way that can’t be easily undermined by insiders or outside
forces.
Specific Protocols and Use Cases
Let’s briefly connect the dots with the protocols named:
Ethereum:  Home of countless DAOs and experiments, it provides the most mature smart contract
environment. Projects on Ethereum are creating tokens to represent data rights (e.g. Ocean Protocol
issues  datatokens  for access to datasets, which data unions could use for selling collective data).
Ethereum’s upcoming upgrades (and layer-2 scaling) will lower costs, making small transactions (like
micro-dividends to users for their attention/data) feasible at scale. Its community has also pioneered
NFT-based community membership (could be used to denote co-op membership) and decentralized
finance, which a social wealth fund could leverage to grow the fund programmatically.
Filecoin:  Useful  for  data  unions/trusts  needing  to  store  large  volumes  of  data  or  content
addressably and verifiably. It’s essentially a decentralized AWS. A data union could store its pooled• 
• 
21
data on Filecoin with encryption; Filecoin’s incentive structure (token rewards for storage) could
reduce costs or even earn the union income by providing open datasets to Filecoin Plus program
(which rewards storing useful public data). Also, Filecoin’s concept of Data DAOs  is emerging: DAOs
formed to curate and finance storage of important datasets (like archiving libraries, scientific data).
This aligns with treating data as a commons asset.
Polkadot:  With its multi-chain setup, one could imagine a Polkadot parachain dedicated to, say, a
global  climate  trust.  Polkadot  offers  robust  on-chain  governance  and  the  ability  for  the  chain’s
governance to control treasury funds (Polkadot’s own treasury is substantial and community-voted
spending  happens  regularly).  A  climate  parachain  could  automate  carbon  credit  issuance  and
connect via Polkadot to other chains (for carbon trading markets, etc.). Polkadot’s  shared security
could help smaller cooperative chains avoid needing their own huge validator sets. Its governance
(especially with OpenGov) is an evolving model of decentralized democracy that other sectors can
learn from.
Cosmos:  Provides sovereignty and modularity – perfect for communities that want full control of
their blockchain. Cosmos SDK has been used to build chains for decentralized exchanges, gaming
communities, and more; it could equally build a chain for a  data cooperative  or a  city coin  that
shares revenue. For example, the city of Seoul could launch a Cosmos chain where citizens vote on
budget proposals (some cities experimented with “city tokens” off-chain; on-chain would increase
transparency). Cosmos chains like Desmos  are aiming to be social networks with user-governance.
The flexibility means a cooperative could encode unique bylaws directly. Cosmos’s IBC means these
specialized  chains  can  still  trade  or  interoperate  (so  a  data  union  chain  could  send  tokenized
payments to an identity chain or accept assets from a wealth fund chain, etc.).
Others:  Protocols like  Aragon ,  DAOstack , or  Colony  (Ethereum-based) specifically provide DAO
frameworks out-of-the-box for governance, which many new co-ops could utilize rather than coding
from scratch. And newer identity/blockchain hybrids like Kleros (for decentralized courts)  can add
a layer of adjudication for disputes that smart contracts can’t handle (say a member claims their data
was misused – a decentralized arbitration could resolve it and enforce a smart contract penalty).
Finally, consider cooperative legal tech : There are efforts to standardize legal wrappers (like LCA) and even
create  “legal DAO templates” . For instance, the UK’s Co-operative Law Association might in future allow a
DAO’s  transaction  history  to  serve  as  proof  of  member  decisions  in  court,  which  would  be  a  deep
integration of blockchain into legal process.
Conclusion and Path Forward
Descriptive Rigor vs. Prescriptive Vision:  In analyzing the foundations of labor power and its prospective
successors,  we  see  a  clear  pattern:  the  leverage  once  afforded  by  labor’s  universality,  inalienability,
perishability, heterogeneity, moral claim, and reciprocity must be reconstituted in new forms if economic
power is to be democratized in the 21st century. Historically, labor’s power was not given; it was organized
and won through institutions – unions, parties, laws – that harnessed those structural features. Similarly,
the  new  sources  of  power  (data,  environmental  commons,  attention,  community  capital)  will  require
institutions and technologies  to truly empower people. • 
• 
• 
22
We  have  surveyed  data  unions,  ecological/land  trusts,  attention-sovereignty  frameworks,  social
wealth funds, platform co-ops , and more, finding that each can mirror aspects of labor’s sixfold leverage: -
Data unions and attention coops tap into new universal assets  of the digital age, asserting inalienable rights
over them and bargaining collectively. - Commons trusts ensure that universal needs  like nature and capital
income are secured for all, with moral authority and reciprocal obligations across society. - Platform co-ops
and new legal forms carry forward the democratic governance  ethos, ensuring heterogeneity of needs is met
by customized, member-driven solutions.
The six leverage points remain a useful lens: for any proposed institution, we should ask, does it include
everyone (universal)? Do individuals maintain dignified rights (inalienable)? Can its power be wielded in a
timely way (perishable)? Does it account for differences and expertise (heterogeneity)? Does it hold the
moral high ground (legitimacy)? And does it create mutual benefit (reciprocity)? By these measures, no
single new institution is a silver bullet – but a  pluralist strategy  (much like labor had both unions and
political movements and cooperatives in its arsenal) is likely to cover all bases. For example, a social wealth
fund can provide universal income (addressing reciprocity and universality), while data unions can give
people voice in tech (addressing heterogeneity of digital experiences and moral claims for digital dignity),
and blockchains/DAOs can supply the trustworthy governance backbone.
Policy and Case Studies:  On the policy front, encouraging these innovations will require legal recognition
and  perhaps  public  investment:  -  Governments  could  update  cooperative  laws  to  accommodate  data
cooperatives  and  platform cooperatives  (as some EU discussions and state laws in the US are doing). They
could also mandate data portability and collective bargaining rights over data (for instance, the EU’s Data
Governance Act explicitly supports  data altruism organizations  and coops). - Setting up  public trusts  for
natural resources (like many constitutions mandate state ownership of minerals, which could evolve into
stakeholder trusts) or even for digital resources (imagine a “data dividend” law requiring companies to pay
into a fund when they profit from user data). - Recognizing personal data as potentially a labor product
to give data unionization a stronger legal footing (some scholars suggest labor law reforms to cover certain
crowdsourcing or user-generated content situations as labor). - Case studies like  Barcelona’s data trust
experiments ,  India’s  data  empowerment  and  protection  architecture  (DEPA) ,  and  Estonia’s  e-
residency  data  governance  could  be  referenced  as  pilot  implementations  of  data  sovereignty.  On
ecological trusts, the Yurok Tribe’s carbon credit program  in California (where a tribe acts as steward of
forest carbon and sells credits, sharing revenue among its members and land restoration) is a working
example  of  communal  environmental  leverage.  For  attention,  Brave  and  also  the  rise  of  subscription
models (Netflix, etc.) show consumers willing to pay to avoid ads – a revealed preference that could be
harnessed by coops offering ad-free collective funding  of content.
Blockchain’s Prescriptive Role:  Technologically, we should continue developing public-interest blockchain
infrastructure: identity solutions for one-person-one-vote, privacy-preserving smart contracts for sensitive
data handling, and legal standards for DAOs to be recognized globally. Protocols like Polkadot and Cosmos,
which  themselves  are  governed  by  token-holder  democracy,  are  essentially  proving  that  decentralized
governance can manage valuable infrastructure – lessons which can be translated into non-crypto realms.
The integration of blockchain into government services (e.g. voting, registries) in countries like Estonia can
lend credibility to these tools. The more these technologies are used in public or cooperative contexts  (rather
than purely speculative finance), the more they will be seen as trustworthy by average citizens.
Balance of Descriptive and Prescriptive:  Descriptively, we can say that labor’s power peaked in a certain
era and has declined with neoliberal globalization and now automation – but prescriptively, we find that new
23
power  centers  are  rising :  data  is  the  “new  oil,”  attention  is  the  chokepoint  of  tech  giants,  and  climate
constraints make environmental stewardship non-negotiable. By treating these as the new “commons”
around which people can unite, we have a chance to not only reclaim what was lost in terms of bargaining
power , but to create a fairer and more inclusive economy than the industrial wage system was. Each person
could become, in effect, a stakeholder in multiple commons: a member of a data union, a beneficiary of a
land  trust  or  climate  dividend,  a  co-owner  of  the  platforms  they  use,  and  a  recipient  of  social  fund
dividends. This multiplicity of affiliations  might replace the singular identity of “worker” that defined 20th-
century power politics.
Finally, it’s important to recognize that none of this will happen automatically. Just as workers had to
organize and sometimes strike or protest to establish unions and rights, citizens and consumers will need
to  push for these new institutions . It might mean forming local data coops, pressuring legislators for
wealth funds, or collectively boycotting platforms to demand user governance. Technology provides tools,
but human agency and solidarity must drive the change. We may well see the rise of  “digital union
organizers”  or “commons activists”  analogous to past labor organizers.
In conclusion, while the tools and contexts are new, the underlying goal remains what it was in labor’s great
struggles: to ensure that economic progress and power are broadly shared, that people have agency in the
systems that govern their lives, and that dignity and fairness are upheld even as technology transforms how
value is created. With thoughtful integration of academic insight, community experimentation, and cutting-
edge technology like blockchain, the six levers of power that once resided in labor can be reimagined and
reasserted in the coming post-automation era – forging a new social contract for the digital age.
