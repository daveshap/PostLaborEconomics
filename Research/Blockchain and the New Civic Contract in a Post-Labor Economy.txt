Blockchain and the New Civic Contract in a Post-
Labor Economy
Introduction
The advance of artificial intelligence and robotics is rapidly approaching a point where human labor may
become economically obsolete . In such a scenario, the traditional system of labor rights – which for over a
century has been a cornerstone of civic power for the working majority – faces an existential challenge. If
machines and algorithms produce all goods and services, how will society balance power and distribute
wealth when people are no longer needed as workers?  This report explores that question through a
comprehensive lens, examining historical theories of power , the looming disruption of a post-labor society,
and  whether  blockchain  and  related  cryptographic  technologies  could  form  the  basis  of  a  new
“laborless” social contract .
We begin by reviewing the history and systems-theoretical underpinnings of labor rights as a pillar of
civic equilibrium , highlighting how collective bargaining and labor power have traditionally kept wealth
concentration and elite dominance in check. We then analyze the destabilizing effects of losing labor as a
bargaining tool  – how the erosion of labor’s leverage could lead to extreme inequality and “elite capture” of
institutions. 
Against this backdrop, the report investigates emerging blockchain-based mechanisms for public agency
that might compensate for the loss of labor power . These include  radical transparency ,  decentralized
participatory  governance  (via  DAOs  and  on-chain  voting),  data  sovereignty  through  self-sovereign
identity, and unstoppable code-based enforcement of rules  via smart contracts. We present case studies
of these concepts in practice – from Ethereum’s decentralized infrastructure and Gitcoin’s quadratic funding
of public goods, to Worldcoin’s proof-of-personhood initiative and Sovrin’s self-sovereign identity network –
illustrating how each addresses aspects of civic life once buttressed by labor . 
Crucially, we evaluate the limitations, risks, and technical barriers  that come with relying on blockchain
systems in lieu of labor rights. Issues like governance token inequality, security vulnerabilities, regulatory
uncertainty, privacy trade-offs, and the digital divide could all undermine a blockchain-based civic paradigm
if left unaddressed. 
Finally, the report offers  normative proposals and frameworks for a blockchain-based civic contract .
We discuss heuristics like quadratic voting, universal basic income (UBI)  distributions via smart contracts,
decentralized  “ownership”  of  productive  AI  via  tokens,  and  policy  ideas  for  integrating  blockchain
governance  into  public  institutions.  Throughout,  the  tone  remains  academic  and  policy-oriented,
acknowledging that technology alone is no panacea  – but if designed with care, it can be a powerful tool
to restore social equilibrium and democratic agency in a world beyond labor .

Power, Labor, and the Historical Role of Labor Rights
Labor rights have long been a core pillar of power balance in modern societies.  From a historical
perspective,  the  ability  of  workers  to  organize  and  bargain  collectively  –  through  unions,  strikes,  and
political movements – became a primary means by which the broad majority could exercise power over
economic and civic life. In the late 19th and 20th centuries, labor movements fought for rights like the
eight-hour workday, safe working conditions, fair wages, and social safety nets. These struggles were not
just about workplace conditions, but fundamentally about  shaping a more equitable distribution of
power and wealth in society . As political economist Adam Dean and colleagues note, the decline of labor
unions since the 1970s in the U.S. was “a major cause” of stagnating wages and rising inequality – evidence
that when labor’s power erodes, economic disparities widen. Conversely, where labor was strong, societies
saw  lower inequality, higher wages, and more robust democracies . In short, labor rights historically
served as a check-and-balance against the concentration of wealth and authority .
From a systems theory  perspective, one can view the economy and polity as an interconnected system of
forces and feedback loops. Labor’s bargaining power functioned as a negative feedback mechanism  that kept
the system stable. If corporate profits grew too large at the expense of wages, strong labor unions would
push back – negotiating higher pay or benefits – thus redistributing resources and preventing runaway
inequality.  This  feedback  loop  helped  maintain  what  we  might  call  civic  equilibrium ,  preventing  the
societal “engine” from overheating due to extreme concentration of power . In political scientist Karl Polanyi’s
terms, the labor movement was part of society’s “double movement” to re-embed the market in social
constraints, countering the excesses of unfettered capitalism. Game theory  also illuminates labor’s role: In
the classic employer-employee “game,” an individual worker is at a disadvantage (easy to replace), but by
forming coalitions (unions) and threatening collective action (strikes), workers changed the payoffs. They
introduced credible commitments to withdraw labor , which forced employers to share more gains or face
costly  shutdowns.  In  effect,  collective  bargaining  solved  a  coordination  problem  among  workers
(preventing the race-to-the-bottom of individuals competing for jobs) and created a more balanced power
dynamic – a kind of negotiated equilibrium in the game of production.
Labor rights thus became enshrined not only in laws (like minimum wage, the right to organize, and labor
standards) but also in the  governance design of many democracies and corporations . For instance,
some countries implemented co-determination laws requiring worker representation on company boards,
integrating  labor’s  voice  into  governance.  Unions  also  became  major  political  actors,  mobilizing  voter
turnout and advocating policies for the working class. This had broad civic impacts: union density correlates
with higher voter participation and pro-democratic policies. It is telling that labor leaders often frame their
role as defending democracy itself . A Harvard Law School project on labor and democracy observes that
labor organizations have been critical in legitimizing and defending democratic governance. In sum, labor
rights have functioned as a cornerstone of the social contract , ensuring that the majority who depend
on selling their labor had a say in how society is run, both economically and politically.
However , these historical achievements were predicated on the assumption that human labor was essential
for production – giving workers  leverage . That leverage underpinned what one might term the “labor
bargain”: workers contribute to economic output, and in return claim a fair share of the gains and a voice in
decisions. The next section explores what happens when that assumption no longer holds – when human
labor is no longer needed or valued in the production process.

The End of Labor Leverage: AI, Automation and Elite Capture
Accelerating advances in automation raise the prospect that we are entering a post-labor society  in which
human workers can be largely replaced by machines and algorithms. In such a scenario, labor’s traditional
leverage  evaporates:  if  capital  owners  (the  “elite”)  no  longer  need  human  labor  to  create  wealth,  the
bargaining power of workers approaches zero. The implications for civic equilibrium are dire. As historian
Yuval Noah Harari warns, we may see the emergence of a “ useless class ” – billions of people pushed out of
employment by AI, essentially “useless” from the perspective of the economy. Harari ranks this rise of the
useless  class  as  one  of  the  21st  century’s  greatest  threats.  It’s  not  simply  an  economic  problem  of
unemployment, but a political problem of disenfranchisement : historically, even elites had to pay heed to
the masses because they depended on their labor or at least their consumer demand. But in a future where
AI and robots generate abundance, elites could perceive the non-working masses as largely irrelevant  –
or worse, a nuisance.
Indeed,  thinkers  are  actively  speculating  about  futures  where  labor’s  disappearance  leads  to  radically
different social outcomes. Sociologist Peter Frase’s “Four Futures”  scenario exercise is instructive. In a best-
case  scenario  of  “Communism”  (post-scarcity  and equality),  advanced  automation  makes  human  labor
obsolete and abundance is shared broadly, resulting in a classless society of equals. However , Frase notes
this outcome would require not just technology but a  “radical shift in human values and governance
structures”  to ensure egalitarian distribution. A more dystopian scenario is “Rentism”: here technology
abolishes the need for labor but wealth remains concentrated  in the hands of those who own the robots,
AI, and intellectual property rights. In Frase’s Rentism, “the privileged few who control intellectual property
secure  perpetual  income  without  significant  contributions  to  productive  labor ,  exacerbating  societal
divisions”. This is a portrait of extreme elite capture : a small minority monopolizes the productive assets
(intelligent machines, patents, data) and, since they don’t need workers, can extract wealth without sharing
or  accountability.  It  fundamentally  “alters  our  understanding  of  work  and  value,”  potentially  stifling
innovation and mobility due to monopoly control of knowledge. Crucially, it  breaks the post-war social
contract  where productivity gains were shared (however imperfectly) with labor – instead, all gains flow to
the owners of capital.
In such a world, the traditional channels through which the majority exert influence – striking for higher
wages,  or  leveraging  labor  scarcity  –  simply  vanish.  Civic  equilibrium  could  quickly  degrade  into
oligarchy or worse . Some analysts even contemplate a scenario Frase terms “Exterminism,” where scarcity
and inequality persist together: a rich elite, freed from reliance on labor , might fortify themselves and
oppress  or  even  eliminate  surplus  populations  to  secure  resources.  While  extreme,  this  scenario
underscores the risk of violent de-coupling of elites from the masses . When asked what holds elites back
from simply ignoring or abusing the majority, historically the answer was: they needed the masses (as
workers, soldiers, consumers). Remove that need, and the  incentive for elite restraint diminishes . We
already see early warning signs – as labor union influence wanes, wealth inequality has skyrocketed and
political power tilts toward the wealthy. A recent Economic Policy Institute report points out that the decline
of unions since the late 20th century directly contributed not only to wage stagnation but also to a more
vulnerable democracy  in the U.S.. Without organized labor countering corporate political influence, policies
favoring the wealthy multiply, and voter suppression efforts face weaker opposition.
Thus, the loss of labor as a bargaining tool threatens a self-reinforcing cycle of elite capture . The rich
few, owning the AI and robot-driven means of production, accumulate even more wealth, which they can
use to influence politics and entrench their position – further excluding the many from wealth or voice.
3
Traditional  redistributive  tools  (progressive  taxation,  welfare  programs)  rely  on  political  power  that
historically  depended  on  labor-backed  mass  movements.  If  those  movements  lose  their  leverage,  can
progressive policies be sustained? This feedback loop of power begetting more power for the elite , and
conversely  disempowerment  begetting  more  disempowerment  for  the  masses,  is  the  fundamental
challenge of a post-labor world.
Yet,  even  as  this  dark  horizon  comes  into  view,  new  forms  of  technology  offer  a  potential
counterweight . The very advances that render labor obsolete – global networks, automation, cryptography
–  also  enable  new  modes  of  organization.  The  key  question  is  whether  blockchain  and  similar
technologies can substitute for labor’s role in the social contract . In other words, can we engineer
alternative mechanisms of public agency, economic solidarity, and accountability  that don’t depend on one’s
value as a worker? The next sections delve into this possibility, starting with the specific capabilities of
blockchains and cryptographic systems that might empower individuals and communities in novel ways.
New Mechanisms for Public Agency: What Blockchain Technology
Enables
Blockchain technology, alongside related cryptographic tools (such as distributed ledgers, smart contracts,
decentralized  identifiers,  and  zero-knowledge  proofs),  offers  a  toolkit  for  reimagining  civic
empowerment and governance  in a post-labor context. These tools fundamentally change how trust,
value, and organization can be managed at scale –  potentially  allowing society to replace some functions
that labor-based institutions used to serve. We focus on four key capabilities of blockchain systems that
could underpin a new civic architecture:
Radical Transparency  – Open, tamper-proof ledgers that make economic and political processes
visible and auditable to all.
Participatory Decentralized Governance  – Decision-making systems (like DAOs) that enable broad,
direct stakeholder participation without centralized gatekeepers.
Data Sovereignty and Decentralized Identity  – Frameworks (like self-sovereign identity) that
return control of personal data and identity to individuals rather than corporate or state authorities.
Unstoppable Protocol Enforcement  – Smart contracts and decentralized networks that 
automatically enforce rules  and agreements, reducing reliance on centralized authorities for
upholding rights.
Each of these mechanisms addresses dimensions of civic life traditionally buttressed by labor power (such
as accountability of elites, representation of the majority’s interests, control over one’s economic identity,
and enforcement of fair play). Below, we examine each capability in turn, noting how it works and why it
matters for a society where human labor can no longer be the leverage it once was.
Radical Transparency and Accountability
Blockchain’s  most  immediate  contribution  is  radical  transparency:  the  ability  to  have  a  public,
immutable ledger  of transactions, decisions, or other records that anyone can inspect. Unlike conventional
institutional record-keeping (which might be siloed, opaque, or alterable behind closed doors), a blockchain
by design openly exposes the flow of information and value . Perianne Boring, of the Chamber of Digital
Commerce, explains: “We are talking about radical transparency. Anyone can look into the blockchain and look
into every transaction that ever happened… and you can use it for any type of provable fact.” . In practice, this•

means that important civic data could be made permanently auditable  by the public  – budgets, election
results, supply chain records, legislative changes, and more. For instance, a city government could record its
procurement contracts or spending on a blockchain; citizens and oversight bodies would then have real-
time access to tamper-proof records of how public funds are used.
This level of transparency can compensate for the absence of labor unions and mass political pressure in
holding powerful actors accountable. In the past, unions or whistleblowers within a workforce might call
out corporate malfeasance or government corruption. In a future with fewer workers, we will rely more on
data visibility  to spot and check abuses. Blockchain ledgers provide a “perfect audit trail” by design .
Every expenditure, every vote, every transfer of assets can be traced. Corrupt intermediaries and hidden
backroom deals become harder to hide  when “all transactions are visible to every participating node in
real-time”. For example, one proposal has been to record land titles and financial records on blockchain
to prevent officials from altering records for personal gain. Similarly, blockchain-based voting systems can
enable public verification of vote counts, mitigating fraud (as discussed further below).
It’s worth noting that transparency is a double-edged sword – absolute openness can conflict with privacy (a
point we’ll revisit in limitations). However , the advent of techniques like zero-knowledge proofs can allow
verification without full disclosure  (e.g. proving a transaction or credential is valid without revealing all
details). Some jurisdictions and organizations are already pushing for blockchain-enabled transparency in
governance. For example, the city of  London had candidates suggesting blockchain ledgers for city
finances and land records  to prevent data manipulation. Even environmental and social governance (ESG)
efforts see potential: De Beers uses a blockchain ledger to track diamonds  and ensure none are conflict-
sourced, illustrating how transparency can enforce ethical standards in supply chains. 
In a post-labor society, radical transparency can serve as a new form of “social audit” . Instead of relying
on labor unions or journalists embedded in workplaces to surface wrongdoing, a transparent ledger makes
oversight collaborative and continuous. Citizens, civic tech developers, NGOs, or AI algorithms can monitor
blockchain-recorded data for anomalies or patterns of misuse. If government benefits or UBI payments are
on-chain, for instance, any attempt by officials to divert funds would be evident in the ledger . This helps
deter “elite misbehavior” by increasing the likelihood of detection  – much as labor unions increased the
costs of exploiting workers. In summary,  blockchain transparency shines a light where labor power
used to cast a shadow , creating a new layer of accountability in the civic system.
Decentralized Participatory Governance (DAOs and On-Chain Voting)
Another  promising  mechanism  is  the  rise  of  decentralized  governance  through  blockchain-based
organizations , often referred to as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations  or DAOs . A DAO is essentially a
collectively-owned,  blockchain-governed  entity  with  decision  rules  encoded  in  smart  contracts.
Participants  (who  can  be  globally  distributed)  hold  tokens  or  credentials  that  allow  them  to  vote  on
proposals, allocate resources, and otherwise steer the organization’s actions – all  without centralized
leadership . DAOs enable a form of participatory governance  that is borderless and peer-to-peer . Vitalik
Buterin  describes  a  DAO  as  “a  collectively-owned  organization  working  towards  a  shared  mission”  where
coordination happens via transparent rules on the blockchain rather than through a traditional hierarchy.
In the context of replacing labor rights,  DAOs offer a way to give individuals voice and agency in
decisions that affect them, independent of their status as employees . Consider how, in the industrial
era, labor unions gave workers a seat at the table in corporate decision-making. In a future where fewer
5
people are employed, one might instead have stakeholder DAOs  for different facets of society – e.g., a DAO
for gig workers  on a platform, or a DAO for residents of a city to manage local resources . Each member
can directly vote on proposals (such as how to spend community funds or set rules) using secure digital
voting. This is participatory democracy hard-coded into software . Notably, blockchain-based voting can
be more  secure and trustworthy than many current voting systems. By leveraging cryptography, votes can
be recorded immutably and even tallied in real-time, while preserving anonymity . Pilot projects have
already demonstrated this potential: West Virginia, USA, trialed a blockchain voting system for overseas
military voters , and it was successful in providing both security and convenience. In Europe, several
political parties and local elections have experimented with crypto-voting to increase verifiability.
A major advantage of blockchain governance is inclusivity at scale . People from anywhere in the world can
coordinate  and  make  collective  decisions  if  they  share  a  common  interest,  without  needing  a  central
authority to organize them. For example, when a group of 17,000+ individuals came together online in 2016
to form “The DAO” venture fund, they pooled $150 million worth of ether  in a completely decentralized
crowd-sale . While The DAO famously had flaws (discussed later), it proved the concept that large-scale,
self-organizing  governance  is  possible  on  Ethereum .  Today,  there  are  DAOs  governing  everything  from
decentralized finance protocols (e.g. MakerDAO managing a stablecoin)  to  collective media (e.g. a
DAO owning NFTs of rare documents) . Gitcoin, discussed further below, is itself a community-run DAO
distributing grants . In a post-labor future, one could imagine many public functions handled by DAOs:
municipal services, public media, even regulatory oversight  could be partly governed by token-holding
communities rather than bureaucrats. This could mitigate elite capture by ensuring  decision power is
distributed among the stakeholders  of a given issue or resource, rather than top-down. 
However , it’s crucial to design decentralized governance carefully. Simple token-voting (1 token = 1 vote)
can replicate plutocracy  if tokens are concentrated. Indeed, one of the fundamental challenges in DAO
governance is managing power imbalances from unequal token distribution . In many early DAOs,
wealthy early backers or founders held a majority of tokens, giving them outsized influence – a dynamic no
better (perhaps worse) than old shareholder capitalism. To truly replace labor’s egalitarian influence, new
governance models are being tried. For instance,  quadratic voting  or  quadratic funding  mechanisms
weight votes such that the voting power grows sub-linearly with tokens , elevating the voice of those with
fewer tokens. This “ one person, one (or at least more equal) vote ” approach helps level the playing field
between  whales  and  average  participants.  Another  model  is  reputation-based  voting :  platforms  like
Colony  assign  voting  weight  based  on  contributions  to  the  community,  not  capital  invested.  These
innovations draw on political science and game theory to create more democratic governance structures
within DAOs , aligning with the principle that everyone affected should have a say , not just those with money.
We will discuss these models further in the proposals section, but it’s important to note that the technology
allows experimentation with governance at a speed and scale impossible in traditional systems .
In summary, decentralized participatory governance via blockchain can give the public a  direct voice in
decisions  that might otherwise be made solely by technocratic elites or AI owners. By designing these
systems to be inclusive, secure, and resistant to capture , society can ensure that even when people are
not “workers” in the traditional sense, they are still citizens with agency  in steering economic and social
outcomes. This is a potential antidote to the disenfranchisement of the post-labor era – one that shifts the
locus  of  power  from  employment  (where  people  used  to  gain  influence  through  unions)  to  digital
participation  (where people gain influence through networks).1

Data Sovereignty and Self-Sovereign Identity
In the age of AI and big data, another arena of power is personal data and identity . Today, tech giants
monetize our data and identities, often without transparent consent or reward to individuals. In a future
where  labor  income  might  vanish,  personal  data  could  become  one  of  the  most  valuable  assets
individuals have  – whether it’s data about your preferences, your health, your genetic code, or your
creative content. Ensuring that individuals  retain sovereignty over their data and digital identities  is
thus crucial for preventing a new form of exploitation that could replace labor exploitation. Blockchain and
cryptographic technologies offer solutions here via self-sovereign identity (SSI)  and decentralized identity
systems.
A  self-sovereign identity  system uses cryptography and distributed ledgers to allow people to  own and
control their identity credentials , rather than relying on centralized authorities (governments, corporations) to
manage identity. In practical terms, this means you would have a digital wallet (secured by keys only you
hold) containing verifiable credentials – such as proof of citizenship, diplomas, work history, or simply a
unique identifier . You could choose to share specific credentials with a service or organization when needed,
and these credentials can be verified via a blockchain without you surrendering the underlying data .
The Sovrin Network is a prominent example of such an SSI metasystem. Sovrin is a public ledger purpose-
built for identity, where only public decentralized identifiers (DIDs)  are recorded on-chain, while personal data
stays off-chain under the individual’s control. As Sovrin’s documentation explains, “SSI means the individual
manages the elements that make up their identity and controls access to those credentials – digitally. The power to
control  personal  data  resides  with  the  individual,  not  a  third  party” .  In  effect,  each  person  becomes  the
sovereign of their own identity , as “no one can take their identity away”  under this model.
Why is data sovereignty  so important in a world without labor? One reason is economic: individuals may
need to leverage their data for income or benefits . If AIs and companies are using your data (say, your
social media behavior to train AI, or your medical data for drug research), an SSI framework could allow you
to permission and even sell usage of your data on your terms , potentially providing an income stream.
We already see early attempts at this, such as  data marketplaces on blockchain  that reward users for
contributing data. More broadly, retaining control means individuals can form “data unions”  to collectively
bargain the value of their data, analogous to how labor unions bargained the value of work. For example, a
group of gig economy drivers might pool driving data and negotiate its sale to an AI mapping company,
distributing  proceeds  among  themselves  –  all  facilitated  by  smart  contracts  that  ensure  payment  and
protect privacy. This flips the current script where corporations simply harvest user data for free.
Another reason is civic inclusion . In a society where rights and benefits (like UBI, voting rights, or access to
services) might be administered digitally, having a secure, universally accepted ID  is essential. We cannot
rely on traditional employment or national IDs as the basis for identity if people are displaced or globally
mobile.  Blockchain-based  identity  can  be  portable  across  borders  and  independent  of  any  single
government’s  records,  which  is  powerful  for  refugees  or  stateless  persons.  The  Worldcoin  project,  for
instance, is building a “proof of personhood”  system: using iris biometrics and zero-knowledge proofs, it
gives each person a unique World ID so they can prove they are a real, unique human in online interactions
. The ID is backed by the blockchain but does not reveal your personal information – it’s just a guarantee
of  uniqueness  and  human  status .  Worldcoin’s  vision  is  that  such  an  ID  could  enable  fair  global  UBI
distribution and help distinguish humans from AI bots in digital forums. This speaks directly to the post-
labor challenge: if billions will rely on some form of social dividend,  we need a tamper-proof way to
ensure each person gets their share exactly once , and that requires robust digital identity. Blockchains2
7
can achieve this in a decentralized way, avoiding a scenario where a single government or corporation
controls the identity system (which could lead to new forms of tyranny or exclusion).
Data  sovereignty  also  has  a  political  empowerment  angle.  Consider  that  much  of  modern  political
discourse and advertising is driven by personal data profiling (think of targeted ads, Cambridge Analytica,
etc.). In a future where people have self-sovereign identity, they could opt out of certain uses of their data
or choose to share data with civic organizations rather than ad networks. They could even verify voting
eligibility or petition signatures via zk-proofs of credentials (proving “I am a citizen of X country and over 18”
without revealing name or ID number , for example). This would enable broader participation  (e.g. global
digital  voting  on  issues)  while  protecting  privacy  and  preventing  fake  identities  from  undermining
processes. ZK (zero-knowledge) proofs are key here: they allow someone to prove a statement about data
is true without showing the data itself . For instance, one could vote on a blockchain voting platform and
then produce a ZK-proof that their vote was counted without revealing who they voted for – thus achieving
the transparency of count and integrity of one-person-one-vote, and the secrecy of the ballot. Experts note
that “ZKPs enable secure and anonymous voting, ensuring appropriate on-chain governance structures” . This is
exactly the kind of cryptographic innovation that aligns with data sovereignty.
In  short,  blockchain-based  identity  frameworks  give  individuals  direct  control  over  their  digital
selves . This diminishes the power asymmetry where elites (tech companies or governments) hold all the
data and thus all the insight and influence. By decentralizing identity and personal information, and by
creating tools for privacy-preserving verification, society can protect people’s rights and value in the digital
realm – much as labor rights protected people in the industrial realm. An individual might no longer have
leverage as a worker , but as a sovereign data-owner and verified citizen, they gain new leverage : they
can demand value for their data, maintain privacy, and reliably assert their rights to social distributions or
participation in governance.
Unstoppable Code: Smart Contracts and Protocol Enforcement
Perhaps the most novel (and controversial) capability of blockchain systems is the idea of “unstoppable”
code-based enforcement of rules  – encapsulated in the phrase “ code is law .” A smart contract  is a self-
executing  program  on  the  blockchain  that  automatically  carries  out  certain  actions  when  predefined
conditions are met, without needing further intervention or permission. Once deployed on a decentralized
network like Ethereum, a smart contract cannot be arbitrarily altered or halted by any single party ; it
will  continue  to  run  as  coded,  as  long  as  the  blockchain  itself  is  operational.  This  creates  a  form  of
“algorithmic enforcement”  that is tamper-resistant and credibly neutral . In a societal context, it means
we can encode rights, obligations, and procedures into smart contracts such that  no authority can easily
override them for their own benefit . This property could fill the void left by the weakening of legal and
institutional enforcement that labor rights used to bolster .
Consider how many labor rights and social protections depend on enforcement by institutions : labor laws
require labor inspectors, courts, and sometimes union vigilance to enforce. If political winds shift (due to
elite lobbying) or if institutions are corrupt, enforcement can lapse. By contrast, if a rule is embodied in a
public smart contract, it is  automatically enforced  by the network consensus. For example, imagine a
government implements a  universal basic income policy via a smart contract : a pool of funds is set
aside, and the contract is coded to pay every verified citizen X amount per month. Once launched, not even
the government could divert those funds elsewhere without everyone noticing , because the rules on-chain would
execute  payouts  as  scheduled.  It’s  like  a  law  that  executes  itself  –  an  unstoppable  UBI  distribution .
8
Indeed,  one  of  blockchain’s  earliest  promise  was  “unstoppable  money”  –  the  idea  that  cryptocurrency
transactions cannot be censored or halted by banks or governments. This property has been demonstrated;
for instance, when certain payment processors blocked donations to WikiLeaks in 2010, Bitcoin provided a
censorship-resistant channel for supporters to send funds. In a civic contract context, this  resistance to
censorship and intervention  could guarantee that  entitlements or public resources can’t be hijacked by
powerful interests .
Another domain is  protocol-based regulation . We could encode rules like “any factory (IoT-monitored)
emitting above X pollution must pay fine Y to a public wallet automatically.” If connected to trusted data
oracles,  such  a  smart  contract  would  automatically  charge  companies  for  emissions,  without  needing
environmental regulatory agencies to sue or prosecute – the compliance is enforced by code . There are
proposals for “smart regulation” in financial markets using similar logic: e.g., if a bank’s leverage exceeds a
threshold, a smart contract could automatically freeze certain risky activities.  Blockchain’s immutability
ensures that these rules cannot be quietly bypassed ; any change requires the transparent consent of the
network or stakeholders (much harder than backroom lobbying). 
The concept of “unstoppable protocol enforcement”  is essentially deploying “freedom as code” at scale .
It removes or reduces reliance on trust in authorities, replacing it with trust in cryptographic protocol. One
Facebook  engineer  was  quoted  saying  of  decentralized  tech:  “It’s  a  command  center  —  intelligent,  fair,
unstoppable.”  – highlighting that if done right, these protocols execute fairly and relentlessly. A concrete
example today is MakerDAO’s stablecoin system : it enforces financial rules (collateral ratios, liquidations)
via  smart  contracts,  with  no  favors  or  exceptions,  something  even  regulators  acknowledge  as  a  new
paradigm of rule enforcement by code rather than human discretion.
Of course, we must acknowledge the flipside:  “unstoppable” code can also rigidly execute bad decisions or
contain bugs . The famous 2016  DAO hack  exemplifies this danger . The DAO’s code had a flaw that an
attacker exploited to siphon ~3.6 million ETH (worth about $70 million then) from the fund . The
contract did exactly what the code allowed – unfortunately, that included an unintended loophole. The
Ethereum  community  had  to  hard-fork  the  blockchain  to  reverse  the  damage ,  a  controversial
intervention that underscored that code is not always  absolute law when the community deems an override
necessary. This taught the lesson that rigorous audits and safeguards are needed : today, best practices
include  formal  verification  of  smart  contracts,  multi-signature  “escape  hatches”  to  pause  contracts  in
emergencies, and other circuit breakers. In the context of a blockchain-based civic system, one must design
a balance between  automatic enforcement  and  flexibility to correct or update rules democratically . We will
return to this in proposals (for example, using time-delayed upgrades  so the public can veto a malicious
change).
When  well-designed,  however ,  smart  contracts  can  guarantee  consistency  and  fairness  in  a  way
traditional institutions often fail to . They do not get bribed, they do not discriminate beyond what the
code  specifies,  and  they  operate  24/7.  A  poignant  small  example  is  how  Gitcoin’s  grant  matching
algorithm  (a form of smart contract logic) will allocate matching funds strictly according to quadratic
funding formulas, rewarding broad community support – no behind-the-scenes influence can skew it . Similarly,
blockchain-based escrow or arbitration services  can ensure that agreements are executed fairly: e.g., gig
workers  might  use  a  smart  contract  that  automatically  pays  them  once  work  (verified  via  oracles)  is
delivered, preventing platforms from arbitrarily withholding pay.34

In a society where people can’t threaten to strike or quit en masse to enforce fairness, having their rights
embedded in code provides a new kind of security . It’s like a digital Magna Carta: rights and rules
enshrined  in  algorithms  that  cannot  be  unilaterally  revoked.  However ,  this  is  not  a  panacea;  careful
governance of the code itself is needed to avoid a tyranny of software. Mechanisms like multi-stakeholder
governance for protocol upgrades  (involving citizens in code changes) will be key. If done correctly,
though,  unstoppable  protocols  could  underwrite  core  aspects  of  the  new  social  contract  –  from
guaranteeing an income floor , to preventing manipulation of public assets, to enforcing collective decisions
exactly as agreed. This technological pillar complements the others (transparency, participation, identity) to
create a robust scaffold for civic life after labor .
Having outlined these four capabilities – transparency, decentralized governance, data self-sovereignty, and
autonomous enforcement – we now turn to concrete case studies and implementations  that demonstrate
these principles in the real world. These examples will show both the potential and the current limitations of
blockchain-based  systems  in  fulfilling  civic  functions  that  once  relied  on  labor  power  or  traditional
institutions.
Case Studies: From Theory to Practice in Blockchain Civics
To  ground  the  discussion,  we  examine  several  real-world  systems  and  projects  that  illustrate  how
blockchain and cryptographic technologies are being used (or proposed) to fulfill civic, economic, and
governance roles. These case studies provide insight into what is possible today, what challenges have
arisen, and how these systems might scale up to form parts of a new civic contract. We will explore:
Ethereum and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs):  The Ethereum blockchain as a
general-purpose platform enabling decentralized governance and “unstoppable” applications,
including notable DAO experiments.
Gitcoin and Quadratic Funding:  A platform demonstrating decentralized, community-driven
funding of public goods, embodying participatory governance and algorithmic resource allocation.
Worldcoin and Proof-of-Personhood:  An initiative combining biometrics, blockchain, and UBI
aspirations – highlighting innovations and controversies around global identity and income
distribution.
Sovrin and Self-Sovereign Identity:  A decentralized identity network showcasing how individuals
can control their credentials and data in practice, with implications for privacy and agency.
Other Emerging Examples:  Brief mentions of additional instances, such as local government pilots
or other DAO-governed communities, to illustrate the growing ecosystem of blockchain civic tools.
Each of these cases connects back to the mechanisms discussed and offers lessons for the viability of
blockchain as a replacement or supplement for labor-based structures.
Ethereum: A Global Platform for Decentralized Governance and Unstoppable Code
Ethereum  is the second-largest public blockchain network (after Bitcoin) and the leading platform for smart
contracts  and  decentralized  applications.  Launched  in  2015,  Ethereum  was  explicitly  designed  to  be  a
“world computer”  – a distributed virtual machine that anyone can use to run code that is  transparent,
immutable, and censorship-resistant . In the context of our discussion, Ethereum is important as the
infrastructure that has enabled most of the decentralized governance and civic experiments to date . Many of the
technologies and examples in this report (DAOs, tokens, decentralized identity, quadratic funding) either•

run on Ethereum or were pioneered there. Ethereum thus serves as a  proof of concept that critical
services  can  operate  without  centralized  institutions :  financial  transactions,  contracts,  even
organizational governance can all be handled by Ethereum-based protocols.
One salient example is the aforementioned The DAO , which was launched on Ethereum in 2016. The DAO
was effectively a decentralized venture capital fund : individuals invested ether (ETH) and received DAO
tokens, which entitled them to vote on proposals for projects to fund and to share in returns. In less than a
month, The DAO raised ~ $150 million in ETH from over 11,000 participants  around the world . This
was unprecedented – it demonstrated that a massive number of strangers could coordinate financially
without a traditional corporate structure . Although The DAO fell victim to a hack, as described earlier , it
was a watershed moment that spawned the ongoing “DAO movement.” Today, Ethereum hosts thousands
of DAOs  of varying sizes – some with treasuries in the billions of dollars (like certain protocol DAOs in
decentralized finance), others small and local. The  governance token model , where people hold tokens
that  allow  voting  on  governance  proposals,  is  now  common.  For  instance,  MakerDAO  (on  Ethereum)
manages the DAI stablecoin (a cryptocurrency pegged to the dollar) through a global community of token
holders who vote on risk parameters, fee rates, and upgrades. This is essentially a  central bank run by
citizens  (token  holders)  rather  than  government  bankers ,  all  made  possible  by  Ethereum’s
infrastructure.
Ethereum  itself  has  also  undergone  governance  challenges  that  illustrate  the  interaction  of  code  and
community. After The DAO hack, Ethereum’s community (via informal off-chain governance) decided to
implement a hard fork  to reverse the theft, effectively restoring the stolen funds. This was controversial – it
went against the notion of strict immutability – and led to a minority splitting off to continue the old chain
(Ethereum Classic). The episode is instructive: it shows that even in decentralized systems, human governance
remains in the loop , but also that blockchain communities can organize and make tough decisions in a
relatively  transparent,  decentralized  fashion.  Since  then,  Ethereum’s  core  development  (like  the  recent
switch to Proof of Stake in 2022) has been guided by open proposals (EIPs) and broad discussion, if not
direct  on-chain  voting.  Newer  blockchain  projects  like  Tezos  and  Polkadot  have  built-in  on-chain
governance, where coin holders can vote on protocol upgrades – giving a taste of how perhaps a  future
digital democracy might amend its “constitution” via token votes .
From a civic standpoint, Ethereum’s biggest contribution is showing that critical economic functions can be
decentralized . People can save, lend, send money (via DeFi) , fund projects (via ICOs or DAOs) , organize
collective action (via DAO tooling) ,  establish identity or reputation (via DIDs and attestations on
Ethereum)  – all without traditional banks, companies or governments at the center . This disintermediation
is  powerful.  It  means  that  if  we  want  to  implement  a  new  social  contract  (say  UBI  or  participatory
budgeting), we  do not necessarily need to route it through a central state or giant corporation; we could
implement it on a public blockchain like Ethereum , ensuring global accessibility and neutrality.
Of  course,  Ethereum’s  open  ecosystem  has  also  seen  pitfalls :  scams,  speculative  bubbles,  hacks,  and
governance failures have occurred. These serve as lessons: for instance, the  2017 boom in ICOs (initial
coin  offerings)  raised  billions  in  an  unregulated  way,  some  of  which  ended  in  fraud  or  failure.  This
highlighted the need for better governance and checks even in decentralized finance . It is analogous to
early capital markets in the 19th century – eventually, norms and regulations (or self-regulations by code)
needed to catch up to prevent abuse. Ethereum’s ongoing development (with initiatives for more secure
contract languages, auditing standards, and identity standards) is addressing some of these issues. The
energy consumption  issue, once a huge criticism, was largely solved by Ethereum’s switch from proof-of-5
11
work (like Bitcoin) to  proof-of-stake consensus , reducing energy use by ~99%. This illustrates that the
technology can evolve to become more sustainable and politically acceptable.
In  summary,  Ethereum  provides  the  backbone  for  implementing  many  blockchain-based  civic
solutions .  It  has  proven  the  viability  of  decentralized  networks  at  scale  (settling  billions  of  dollars  in
transactions daily) and the concept of autonomous organizations and agreements that operate without
centralized control . Its existence and resilience give confidence that if we encode parts of our new civic
contract in blockchain applications, the underlying platform can carry them out. As we look to specific
solutions  like  Gitcoin,  Worldcoin,  and  Sovrin,  it’s  worth  remembering  that  Ethereum  (and  similar
networks)  are  the  public  infrastructure  making  them  possible ,  much  as  roads  and  utilities  made
industrial society’s institutions possible.
Gitcoin: Quadratic Funding and the Decentralized Funding of Public Goods
One of the compelling case studies in how blockchain can replicate civic functions is Gitcoin , a platform that
uses decentralized methods to fund public goods and open-source projects . Gitcoin emerged from the
Ethereum  community  in  2017  with  a  mission  to  support  the  development  of  open-source  software  –
something traditionally underfunded (since it’s a public good) but vital to the digital economy.  Gitcoin’s
innovation  is  to  use  a  quadratic  funding  mechanism,  executed  via  smart  contracts,  to  allocate
matching funds based on broad community support . This is essentially a new funding model for the
commons , one that aims to be more democratic and efficient than either centralized grant committees or
pure market funding.
Here’s how it works: Gitcoin runs periodic grants rounds  where many projects (not only software now, but
also climate initiatives, educational programs, etc.) invite contributions. Alongside individual donations from
the  crowd,  there  is  a  matching  pool  of  funds  provided  by  sponsors  (often  large  crypto  donors  or
organizations like the Ethereum Foundation). The allocation of the matching pool to projects is determined
by  the  quadratic  funding  formula.  In  quadratic  funding  (QF),  the  key  principle  is  that  matching  is
proportional to the  square of the sum of square roots of contributions  – which simply means  the
number of distinct contributors matters much more than the total amount contributed . A project that
raised $100 from 50 people (each giving $2 on average) will get a much larger match than a project that
raised $100 from 1 person. This reflects a democratic ideal: a project that has many people’s support, even with
small dollars, is deemed more socially valuable than one rich person’s pet project . In practice, Gitcoin’s smart
contracts tally all contributions and then compute the optimal matching distribution. This computation is
transparent and verifiable on-chain (anyone can inspect the contributions and the resulting match). The
result is that  Gitcoin has been able to fund a wide array of public goods in a way that responds to
community preferences rather than top-down decisions .
The impact has been significant. Since 2019, Gitcoin has provided over $56 million in funding to public
goods projects  across open source, Ethereum infrastructure, community, climate tech, and more. Over
6,000 projects have been funded  in its first few years. This makes Gitcoin a substantial financier of global
public  goods  –  effectively  a  decentralized,  voluntary  counterpart  to  government  R&D  grants  or
philanthropic foundations. Some projects that started with Gitcoin grants (like decentralized developer
tools, or COVID relief efforts in some regions) might not have found funding otherwise. Kevin Owocki,
Gitcoin’s founder , framed the mission as  “funding what matters to your community”  – empowering
communities to collectively support the resources they rely on, which traditional markets undervalue. This is
a clear parallel to labor unions historically pooling resources for mutual aid or political causes, except
12
Gitcoin’s “union” is open to anyone globally and decisions are made by a distributed crowd’s donations
rather than union officials.
Gitcoin also exemplifies  participatory governance  in its operations. It evolved into a  DAO (GitcoinDAO)
which now manages the platform. GitcoinDAO has token holders and delegates who propose and vote on
changes (for example, decisions like moving to a new blockchain (they launched their own sidechain called
Public  Goods  Network)  or  modifying  matching  rules  are  done  through  community  governance).
Interestingly, GitcoinDAO is learning that pure decentralization can be inefficient; recently it decided to
simplify and become more “streamlined” (some described it as “going kinda corporate”) by granting more
decision power to core teams for agility. This highlights a  pragmatic approach : even within a DAO, some
centralization or leadership can help, as long as it’s accountable to the community. The lessons Gitcoin is
learning mirror those of traditional civic organizations  – balancing broad participation with effective
execution – but in a far shorter timespan and with global stakeholders.
From  a  systems  perspective,  Gitcoin  demonstrates  a  working  model  of  decentralized  wealth
redistribution and civic investment . It channels funds from those with resources (crypto donors) to those
creating shared value (developers, activists) in an automated, bias-minimized way. It’s as if one took the
idea of  taxation and public spending  and made it voluntary and algorithmic: individuals “contribute” to
projects they like (like earmarking taxes) and the algorithm amplifies the collective signals. This doesn’t
entirely replace the need for actual taxation or state spending (since Gitcoin relies on voluntary donations),
but it suggests a future where communities around the world self-organize to fund their public goods
via blockchain , reducing reliance on nation-state budgets which may be strained in a post-work economy.
In fact, some economists have mused that if automation increases private wealth but erodes the tax base
(due to joblessness), voluntary, global funding mechanisms might be crucial to finance public goods . Gitcoin’s
success to date provides a template for that.
The  quadratic funding mechanism  itself, championed by economists like Glen Weyl, is a  heuristic to
restore equilibrium in resource allocation . It ensures broad interests are represented rather than just
concentrated capital – echoing how labor unions aimed to give the broad workforce representation against
concentrated capital owners. By encoding that principle in a formula, Gitcoin shows one way to  embed
fairness into the code . Other DAO projects are taking note; for instance, cityDAO experiments and some
philanthropies are looking at quadratic voting for community decisions.
In conclusion, Gitcoin showcases blockchain’s capacity to fulfill a civic function historically tackled by
governments or civil society : funding the commons. It has created an open, global version of a grants
council that is arguably more attuned to the people’s will (as expressed in micro-donations) and more
transparent in execution  (every grant and result is public). The limitations are that it currently depends on
a somewhat niche crypto community and donors – scaling it to mainstream public goods (like roads or
fundamental research) would require much larger pools of capital. Yet, as automation advances, perhaps
the very companies benefiting could channel funds into such decentralized public goods funding (indeed,
Optimism, an Ethereum scaling network, directs a portion of its transaction fees to public goods
funding via a similar model ). Gitcoin is an early but powerful demonstration that  the loss of labor-
organized public good provision (like union-run community programs or worker lobbying for public
spending) could be offset by new, blockchain-organized public good provision .

Worldcoin: Proof-of-Personhood and Universal Basic Income Experiments
Worldcoin  is one of the most talked-about – and contentious – projects at the intersection of blockchain
and the future of society. Co-founded by Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI), Worldcoin’s aim is to create a global
digital  identity  and  cryptocurrency  that  could  support  universal  basic  income  (UBI) .  The  project
encapsulates several themes: proof-of-personhood  (ensuring each human can be uniquely identified in the
system),  decentralized  identity  via  biometrics  (using  iris  scans  as  a  unique  ID,  coupled  with  zero-
knowledge cryptography), and the idea of bootstrapping a UBI by giving everyone a crypto token . Given
our discussion, Worldcoin can be seen as an ambitious attempt to directly address the “labor obsolete”
scenario :  if  AI  (like  Altman’s  own  OpenAI  products)  creates  tremendous  wealth  while  displacing  jobs,
Worldcoin is positioning itself as an infrastructure to redistribute wealth to every human on earth, outside
the traditional labor market.
The core of Worldcoin is the World ID , a “digital passport” that proves you are a unique human . The
system  uses  a  custom  device  called  the  Orb,  a  shiny  spherical  iris  scanner .  People  who  want  to  join
Worldcoin  have  their  iris  scanned  by  an  Orb  (Worldcoin  has  had  sign-up  stations  in  various  cities
worldwide). The device converts the iris scan into a unique numerical code (an “iris hash”) and checks it
against the database to ensure that person hasn’t signed up before. Importantly, Worldcoin says the actual
iris images are not stored; rather , the hash is and it’s  impossible to reverse-engineer the iris from the hash .
Once  verified,  the  person  is  issued  a  World  ID  –  essentially  a  decentralized  identifier  (DID)  –  and  a
cryptographic proof of uniqueness  (using zero-knowledge proofs so that later they can prove they have a
World ID without revealing which one or any biometric info). In simpler terms, Worldcoin creates a global
list of real people, each represented by an anonymous ID . This tackles a huge problem in decentralized
governance: Sybil attacks  (one person pretending to be many). With proof-of-personhood, one human gets
one vote or one share of the UBI, preventing exploitation by bots or duplicates.
Upon signing up, users in many countries have been receiving a free allocation of the  Worldcoin token
(WLD)  – for example, 25 WLD tokens (around $50–60 value at launch). The idea is that these tokens could
increase in value as adoption grows, and one day might be used as a currency for UBI distributions or a
currency within a global economy of humans . Altman has suggested that if AI and automation produce
immense wealth, a currency like Worldcoin could help distribute it to people universally as a basic
income . Indeed, Altman has long been interested in UBI (he funded trials in Oakland) and sees Worldcoin
as a tool to implement UBI globally. The project is still in early stages – as of mid-2023, about 2 million
people had signed up during beta, and the official launch spurred more interest (along with pushback from
regulators).
Worldcoin demonstrates some technical possibilities  relevant to replacing labor rights: it shows that it is
possible  to  create  a  single  global  registry  of  humans  without  a  central  government ,  using  a
combination of biometrics and cryptography. This is groundbreaking because one prerequisite for many
social  policies  (like  UBI  or  democratic  participation)  is  to  prevent  fraud  (one  person  claiming  multiple
benefits or votes). Historically, nation-states issue identities (passports, SSNs) and manage benefits within
their borders. But a post-labor world might demand  global  solutions (as AI’s impact is global and people
might migrate to where resources are). Worldcoin’s approach is one attempt at  globally inclusive identity ,
where for example an unemployed person in Nigeria and one in Japan both can prove they are distinct
humans and thereby both receive the same crypto stipend if a UBI program were implemented. It lowers
the barrier to inclusion  in the economic system to simply having eyes and being willing to scan them,
rather than needing paperwork or bank accounts.
14
However , the  controversies and risks around Worldcoin are significant , highlighting issues that any
blockchain  social  contract  design  must  carefully  navigate.  First  is  privacy  and  surveillance  concerns.
Scanning people’s irises worldwide rings dystopian alarms for many. Edward Snowden criticized it bluntly:
“Don’t catalogue eyeballs”  and “the human body is not a ticket-punch” , expressing concern that even if hashed,
the biometric data could be misused. Privacy advocates worry about how the biometric data is stored and
whether individuals could be de-anonymized. Worldcoin claims to delete raw images and only keep hashes,
but trust is a factor; some fear a future where an authoritarian actor could use World IDs to track people if
not truly secure. This is a lesson that  technological solutions must be paired with social trust and
robust governance . In absence of labor power , we don’t want to create a new tool of control.
Second, consent and exploitation  issues have arisen. Investigations (e.g. by MIT Technology Review) found
troubling practices in early Worldcoin sign-ups: in some developing countries, people were not given full
information (terms only in English, not local language) and were lured by small rewards like ~$20,
without clarity on data usage . There were reports in countries like Sudan and Indonesia of aggressive
sign-up drives where participants didn’t understand Worldcoin’s purpose, effectively treating vulnerable
populations as guinea pigs for a global tech experiment. This echoes past labor issues (e.g. exploiting cheap
labor in poor countries) now transposed to  exploiting personal data or biometrics  of those in need. It
underlines that without ethical oversight, even “world-saving” tech projects can perpetuate inequalities  – here,
informational and power asymmetry between Worldcoin operators and participants.
Additionally, a black market for World IDs  emerged: people in some places were selling their biometric
credentials for quick cash  to speculators who hoped to collect the free tokens . This both undermines
the system’s integrity and indicates how economic hardship can push individuals to monetize anything –
now even one’s identity – if labor income is lacking. In Kenya, authorities suspended Worldcoin in 2023
citing concerns over data privacy and security, as tens of thousands of Kenyans rushed to get the token
money,  raising  alarms  about  informed  consent .  This  scenario  suggests  that  any  attempt  to
implement  a  large-scale  blockchain-based  social  benefit  must  involve  local  stakeholders  and  clear
regulatory frameworks  to protect participants.
On the positive side, Worldcoin has sparked broader conversation and other initiatives in the  proof-of-
personhood space . Another project,  Proof of Humanity  (mentioned in the Time article), used a web-of-
trust and video verification approach to register humans and actually distributed a UBI token called UBI
(about $50–100 monthly at peak) to each verified person. That project faced its own issues (the token value
crashed in the bear market), but it showcased a different, community-driven model. It’s possible that the
best solution will combine ideas: e.g., multiple proof-of-person systems (biometric, social attestations, etc.)
cross-verified for robustness.
In essence, Worldcoin is a bold attempt to create the plumbing for a post-labor economy (global ID +
global currency) , but it highlights that technological solutions can’t be divorced from ethics and governance . If
labor rights once ensured dignity and consent in the workplace, any new system must ensure dignity and
consent in the digital sphere. The outcry from privacy experts and the swift action of some regulators on
Worldcoin indicate that society will demand strong protections in any blockchain-based civic system  –
a valuable lesson for our normative proposals later .
Despite the controversies, the core idea of ensuring every individual has a verifiable digital identity and
a share in tech-generated wealth remains powerful . Worldcoin’s ongoing evolution (it has a foundation
and is engaging with regulators) will be worth watching. It may or may not succeed as the dominant6

platform, but it has already moved the needle on concepts like  self-sovereign biometrics, global UBI
distribution, and the need for open discourse on how to implement them . For our purposes, Worldcoin
illustrates both the  potential (global inclusion, AI dividends) and pitfalls (privacy, coercion)  of using
blockchain tech to replace labor’s role in guaranteeing individuals a share of prosperity.
Sovrin: Self-Sovereign Identity in Action
While Worldcoin represents one approach to global identity (biometric-heavy and controversial),  Sovrin
provides a more understated but fundamentally important case study of  self-sovereign identity (SSI)
implemented  via  blockchain  technology.  The  Sovrin  Network  is  a  decentralized,  public-permissioned
ledger purpose-built to support identity management on a global scale. Unlike Worldcoin, Sovrin doesn’t
aim to create a new currency or directly address UBI; instead, it focuses purely on empowering individuals
(and organizations) with control over their digital identities and credentials . This directly ties into the
data sovereignty  mechanism discussed earlier , and Sovrin is arguably one of the most mature examples of
that principle in practice.
On Sovrin, every user (or “Identity Owner”) can have one or multiple  Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)  –
unique strings that serve as addresses on the network. These DIDs are registered on the Sovrin ledger ,
which acts as a global public utility for resolving DIDs to public keys , enabling trustable interactions. The
personal data (actual credentials like “Alice’s driver’s license” or “Bob’s university degree”) are not stored on-
chain; instead, they are held by the user in digital wallets and only shared peer-to-peer when the user
chooses. Sovrin’s ledger merely anchors the public  elements needed (like the issuers’ public keys, credential
schemas, revocation registries, etc.). This design achieves  privacy by architecture : you don’t put private
data on the blockchain, you put just enough info to verify authenticity of credentials. For example, the DMV
could issue Alice a digital driver’s license credential signed with their private key. Alice stores it. When she
needs to prove to a bar that she’s over 21, she can present a  zero-knowledge proof derived from her
license credential  that reveals only “I am older than 21” without revealing her birthdate or license number
(Sovrin supports such ZK-proof-capabilities). The verifier (the bar) checks the Sovrin ledger to see that the
DID of the issuer (DMV) is legit and that the credential signature is valid and not revoked. This all happens
without any central database query – it’s decentralized trust.
The governance of Sovrin is also notable. It is run by the Sovrin Foundation, a non-profit , and the ledger
nodes are operated by  Stewards  – organizations (companies, universities, NGOs) around the world that
apply and are approved to run the infrastructure. Over 50 stewards across six continents were involved,
including  IBM,  Deutsche  Telekom,  universities,  etc..  They  abide  by  a  common  Sovrin  Governance
Framework  that sets rules on how the network is used and how privacy is protected. No single entity
controls  the  network  –  which  is  crucial  for  maintaining  trust  that  this  identity  system  isn’t  another
centralized silo. This addresses a piece of the puzzle in a post-labor world: we need global digital utilities
(like  identity  systems)  that  aren’t  owned  by  any  government  or  tech  giant  but  are  community-
governed. Sovrin’s model shows how that can work for identity.
In practical use, Sovrin (and the underlying tech like Hyperledger Indy and Aries) has been piloted in various
contexts:  for  example,  the  government  of  British  Columbia  and  others  formed  the  Verifiable
Organizations Network  issuing business credentials on Sovrin; some humanitarian organizations have
tried Sovrin-based IDs for refugees; and companies use it for single sign-on and credential verification. One
oft-cited success is that Estonia’s e-residency and eID system , while not Sovrin, similarly gives citizens a
digital identity to interact with services, boasting high satisfaction. (A blog claims Estonia’s blockchain-
16
supported eID increased satisfaction with gov services from 32% to 99% – though that number seems very
high, it underscores the perceived impact of empowering citizens digitally).
For the purposes of replacing labor rights, Sovrin’s approach to identity means individuals could carry
their “social reputation” and credentials independently of employers or governments . Think about
labor rights – part of labor power was the ability to show one’s qualifications, organize with others, and
have a status in society beyond a single job . In the gig/AI economy, Sovrin-like identity can allow, for
instance, gig workers to hold a verifiable record of all the gigs they’ve done and ratings they earned, which
they control and can present to any platform – preventing lock-in to one company’s reputation system. It
gives portability of merit and history . Also, in interacting with algorithmic systems or claiming benefits, a
Sovrin ID could let you prove eligibility without third parties data-mining you. For example, to get a future
crypto-UBI, you might prove “I am a unique person and a resident of X country” via credentials in your
wallet, without exposing more (avoiding surveillance or discrimination). This preserves  personal agency
and privacy  – values core to human dignity that were also central to labor movements (which often fought
against intrusive employer practices and for personal privacy off the job).
An important civic aspect of SSI like Sovrin is  reducing dependency on centralized platforms . Today,
losing your job can mean losing your corporate email, your LinkedIn visibility, etc. With self-sovereign
identity, your professional and social identity is yours to keep; you just detach from an employer context. In
a  future  where  jobs  are  rare,  people  might  form  communities  or  co-ops  that  recognize  each  other’s
contributions via verifiable credentials (e.g., community service hours, skills learned). This could form the
basis of  non-labor social credit  – not in the Big Brother sense, but in a positive, empowering sense of
recording one’s contributions to society  even if unpaid, and being recognized for them. For instance, someone
might earn credentials for volunteering, for creating digital art, for mentoring others, etc., and these could
feed into how governance tokens or UBI distributions are allocated (to reward pro-social activity, something
some DAO experiments consider with “proof-of-impact” tokens).
In summary, Sovrin is a quieter revolution compared to Worldcoin, but arguably a more foundational one
for building a fair post-labor society . It provides the means for  anyone to identify and authenticate
themselves in a decentralized way , which is as fundamental to participating in society as a worker’s right
to their own personhood and to organize was in the labor era. By eliminating the need to rely on corporate
or state intermediaries for identity, SSI ensures that  people’s access to economic and civic rights isn’t
mediated by employment or arbitrary authorities . However , challenges remain: getting wide adoption
(network effect issues), ensuring interoperability (multiple SSI networks need common standards), and
dealing with cases where people lose their private keys (Sovrin has mechanisms like social recovery but it’s
still a UX challenge). These are being actively worked on by an open community.
Together , the above case studies (Ethereum/DAOs, Gitcoin, Worldcoin, Sovrin) paint a picture of a possible
new civic landscape: one where  global platforms for collaboration, funding, identity, and exchange
exist that are not controlled by traditional power holders . They are  tools that, if used well, could
redistribute power to individuals and communities , even when those individuals no longer have power
via labor . But as we’ve hinted, these systems are not without flaws or risks. In the next section, we explicitly
tackle the limitations, risks, and barriers  of relying on blockchain systems to replace or augment labor
rights, both in theory and as evidenced by real experiences like those we just discussed.
17
Limitations and Risks of Blockchain Systems as a Replacement for
Labor Rights
While  blockchain  and  cryptographic  technologies  offer  unprecedented  possibilities  for  empowering
individuals and communities, they are not a cure-all , and deploying them as the backbone of a new social
contract comes with significant challenges. It is critical to  soberly assess the limitations and risks  –
technical, social, and political – of these systems, especially if they are to carry out functions previously
upheld by labor power and legal protections. Here we break down the major concerns:
Power Concentration and Inequality in Decentralized Systems
Security Vulnerabilities and Technical Failures
Scalability and Efficiency Constraints
Privacy Concerns vs. Transparency
Legal and Regulatory Uncertainty
Adoption, Accessibility, and the Digital Divide
New Forms of Exploitation and Abuse
By  examining  each,  we  can  understand  where  blockchain  governance  might  fail  or  even  exacerbate
problems, and thus what safeguards or complementary measures are needed.
Power Concentration and Inequality in Decentralized Systems
One might assume that “decentralized” automatically means fair and egalitarian, but decentralization can
still hide power imbalances . A chief risk is the emergence of plutocracy within blockchain governance
– effectively replacing one elite (capital owners) with another (token holders, who, often, are capital owners
too). As noted earlier , in many DAOs voting power is tied to token holdings , and wealth distribution in
crypto is highly skewed. This leads to scenarios where a small number of large token holders can exert
disproportionate influence over decisions . For example, if a social welfare DAO was governed by a token,
whales could sway how resources are allocated, possibly against the interests of the majority. This mirrors
the very elite capture we seek to avoid , just in digital form. Studies and real incidents have shown this: in
one  case,  a  single  large  voter  in  the  Steem  blockchain  essentially  centralized  control  (leading  to  a
contentious fork). Even Ethereum’s decentralized finance has been criticized  because governance tokens
are often concentrated with venture investors or founders.
There are mitigations: we discussed quadratic voting/funding  and reputation-based governance  as ways
to curb plutocracy. These are promising, but not yet widespread. Additionally, Sybil resistance  is needed to
enforce  one-person-one-vote  schemes  (hence  the  importance  of  proof-of-personhood  like  World  ID  or
Proof of Humanity). Without robust Sybil control, any system trying to give equal voice can be gamed by
fake identities. So, solving identity is a prerequisite to solving governance equality . Even then, we face
the social challenge of engagement : just as in democracies a small organized group can dominate if the
majority is apathetic, in DAOs often only a small fraction of token holders vote. Low participation can lead to
decision-making by the few who are active , skewing outcomes. This is reminiscent of low voter turnout
issues in public elections (exacerbated when unions or civic orgs that mobilize voters weaken). So, while
blockchain  lowers  barriers  to  participation  (you  can  vote  from  your  phone,  etc.),  it  doesn’t  guarantee
participation .  There  may  need  to  be  incentives  or  cultural  shifts  to  encourage  broad  engagement  in
governance – otherwise power will centralize by default to those with the time, knowledge, and resources.•

Information asymmetry  is another subtle factor . Even with transparency, understanding complex protocol
proposals or funding decisions requires expertise. This could lead to a  technocracy of coders  or those
fluent in blockchain jargon. One could argue this is analogous to how, in labor relations, specialized lawyers
or  economists  could  dominate  negotiations,  but  at  least  unions  employed  their  own  experts.  In
decentralized communities, if average people cannot easily grok the issues, they might defer to “core devs”
or crypto influencers – again creating a hierarchy. We see hints of this in some crypto projects where a
charismatic founder or core team still effectively guides the direction (the community often rubber-stamps).
This challenges the ideal of autonomous grassroots governance .
In sum,  there is a risk that decentralized systems replicate or even intensify inequality  if design
choices aren’t carefully made to distribute power . The early crypto wealth distribution, often called the
“Bitcoin or Ethereum whales,” is a reality: e.g., at one point, ~2% of addresses owned 95% of Bitcoin. If those
same distributions apply to tokens that govern our notional future UBI system or public resource DAO, the
outcome could be as unequal as the Gilded Age. So, explicit mechanisms to counterbalance wealth  – akin to
how labor unions counterbalanced capital – must be part of system design. We have those mechanisms
(quadratic voting, soulbound non-transferable tokens for merit, etc.), but implementing them widely is an
ongoing challenge.
Security Vulnerabilities and Technical Failures
Entrusting key civic functions to blockchain systems means they must be extremely secure and reliable  –
otherwise people’s rights could vanish with a hack or bug. Unfortunately, the track record shows that smart
contract vulnerabilities and other technical failures are not uncommon . We’ve recounted the  DAO
hack of 2016  where a single bug led to millions of dollars being stolen. Since then, numerous decentralized
finance (DeFi) hacks have occurred (over $3 billion stolen in 2022 alone by exploiting flaws in code or
protocol logic). If these systems were only about money, it’s bad enough – but imagine if a flaw allowed
someone to  falsify identity credentials or siphon a UBI fund . The consequences would be severe for
society’s trust in the system.
Security is improving  – professional audits, formal verification, and hacker bounties are now standard for
serious projects. But the technology is still young, and the complexity increases as we incorporate advanced
cryptography (like zero-knowledge circuits) which could have subtle bugs. Even Ethereum’s core code has
had vulnerabilities (like the inflation bug in 2018 that was discretely patched). The specter of a 51% attack
on a blockchain (where an attacker gains majority mining or validation power to rewrite history) is another
risk. Major networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum are likely safe from this due to scale, but smaller blockchains
or side-chains could be attacked, undermining the immutability that is promised. For instance, some minor
cryptocurrencies have seen 51% attacks that reversed transactions.
Key management  is a huge practical security issue for users. In a blockchain world,  “your keys, your
coins; no keys, no coins.”  If individuals are to hold their own identity keys, vote tokens, etc., then losing
one’s private key (or having it stolen via phishing or malware) could mean losing one’s digital identity or
funds permanently . Traditional systems have account recovery through customer support; decentralized
ones often do not (though social recovery and multi-sig techniques are emerging, they add complexity). The
average person might find the responsibility of securing keys daunting – raising the prospect that they will
delegate  it  to  custodial  services,  reintroducing  central  points  of  failure.  This  interplay  of  usability  and
security is crucial: a system unusable by non-experts will fail to gain adoption or will ironically centralize as
people flock to easier solutions (like keeping funds on a big exchange, or using a single identity provider).
19
Smart contract immutability  is a double-edged sword: bugs are hard to fix on the fly. Ethereum’s forced
fork after The DAO was an exception; generally, “code is law” means if something goes wrong, there’s no
quick remedy . This rigidity is risky in governance – what if a smart contract implementing a benefit formula
has an error? We’d need a robust upgrade mechanism which itself must be secure (e.g., a time delay and
multi-party confirmation to patch). We likely need  circuit breakers  in critical contracts – similar to how
traditional systems have failsafes.
Another angle:  dependency on oracle inputs and external data . Many blockchain-based civic apps will
rely on real-world data (e.g. IoT sensors for environmental enforcement, or population data for UBI). These
oracles  can be points of failure – they could be corrupted or go offline, causing smart contracts to behave
incorrectly (like triggering false penalties or missing payouts). Solutions like decentralized oracle networks
(Chainlink, etc.) help, but they add complexity and cost.
Finally, consider  catastrophic scenarios : if the internet goes down in an area, or if a solar flare or EMP
knocks  out  infrastructure,  do  people  lose  access  to  their  “rights”  encoded  on  blockchain?  Traditional
systems often have offline backups; distributed ledgers are more resilient in some ways (multiple copies),
but also require connectivity. Planning for resilience (perhaps local nodes, mesh networks, physical token
proofs) would be needed to ensure continuity of the civic functions in disasters.
In summary, technical risk is non-trivial . Just as early industrial workers faced safety risks until regulations
improved standards, early adopters of crypto have faced security risks. For blockchain to underwrite social
rights, it must reach a level of robustness akin to banking or government systems (and ideally better). This
will likely require continued maturation of the technology, rigorous testing, and maybe hybrid approaches
where  critical  safety  nets  exist  (for  example,  a  constitutional  DAO  might  have  an  emergency  vote
mechanism to freeze a contract if a major bug is found, akin to a recall of a defective product).
Scalability and Efficiency Constraints
Blockchain networks historically face challenges in scalability (transactions per second, storage capacity)
and efficiency (speed, cost of use) . If we are to migrate large-scale civic processes (like a national voting
system or global UBI micropayments for billions) onto blockchains, these networks must handle  high
throughput . Classic Bitcoin can do ~7 transactions per second, Ethereum currently maybe ~15-30 on Layer
1 (with much more on Layer 2 rollups). By comparison, Visa handles thousands per second routinely.
Significant progress is being made – e.g. Ethereum’s rollups and sharding roadmap, or alternative high-
throughput chains – but  the jury is still out on whether decentralized networks can scale to global
population levels while maintaining true decentralization . There is often a trade-off between scalability
and decentralization : more centralized solutions (like permissioned chains or those with few validators) can
be faster , but reintroduce trust in a few actors.
If systems don’t scale, the danger is twofold: either they become  slow/expensive , or they  centralize to
scale . Neither is acceptable for critical public infrastructure. For instance, Ethereum gas fees have spiked to
painful levels in the past (e.g. $50+ to do a token transaction during 2021 peaks). Imagine those costs
applied to everyday micro-transactions or voting – it would exclude those who can’t pay, effectively creating
a class barrier . High fees or slow performance could recreate inequality  (only the affluent efficiently use
the system) or simply drive people away to centralized solutions (like using a big tech company’s faster
sidechain, giving that company power). In recent years, Layer 2 scaling solutions (Optimistic and ZK rollups)
have  dramatically  lowered  costs  for  users  while  inheriting  main-chain  security.  This  is  promising:  e.g.,
20
simple transactions on some Layer 2s cost fractions of a cent now. Still, complex operations (like ZK proof
verification or privacy-preserving actions) can be computationally heavy, and cost remains a factor .
Storage and bandwidth : If we envision putting a lot of records (like public finance data, or millions of
credential attestations) on-chain, that could bloat the blockchain, making it hard for individuals to run
nodes (which hurts decentralization). Pruning techniques and distributed storage networks (IPFS, Arweave,
etc.)  can  offload  bulk  data,  but  we  then  rely  on  their  integrity.  It’s  manageable  but  requires  careful
architecture.
Another aspect is  energy efficiency . Proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin have been critiqued for high
energy  use  (comparable  to  a  country’s  electricity  consumption).  Ethereum’s  shift  to  proof-of-stake
dramatically cut its footprint, and many newer chains use PoS or other low-energy consensus. So, while
energy concern is being addressed, any plan to make blockchain the backbone of society must ensure it’s
done in an environmentally sustainable way – otherwise it’s trading one crisis (inequality) for another
(climate  impact).  Thankfully,  it  appears  most  major  platforms  are  moving  away  from  energy-intensive
consensus,  and  some  (like  Algorand,  Tezos)  tout  carbon  neutrality.  Still,  the  computing  overhead  of
cryptography and global consensus is not trivial, meaning a blockchain-based system might always be
somewhat less efficient than a centralized database . That’s the cost of decentralization. We have to
judge if the benefits (trust, resilience) justify that cost for each application.
Latency  is also a consideration: a Bitcoin transaction might finalize in an hour , Ethereum in a few minutes
(depending on confirmations). In governance or daily interactions, some delays are fine (e.g., you don’t
need instant finality for a monthly UBI payment), but others might need to be faster . New blockchains and
rollups are achieving sub-second block times and faster finality, so this is improving. But complex cross-
chain interactions (like using identity from one chain on another , or moving funds) can introduce latency or
points of failure.
The concept of  “layered architecture”  likely is key: base layers for global consensus (slower but ultra-
secure), and second layers for speed (with periodic settlement on base layer). This requires careful design
so that the user experience is smooth and the security assumptions are acceptable. We likely will hide
complexity under user-friendly apps that abstract whether something happened on a sidechain vs mainnet
etc.
Finally, governance scalability  is an interesting issue: on-chain voting with millions of participants has not
been done frequently. We must ensure that the user interfaces, education, and processing of potentially
millions of votes are ready. If not, on-chain governance could become unmanageable or suffer from low
participation.
In summary,  scalability is a solvable but still pressing issue . The risk if not solved is that blockchain
systems either  fail under load, price out the poor, or resort to centralizing shortcuts  – any of which
would undermine the goal of an equitable post-labor system. As a mitigating note, technology tends to
improve, and the intense research in blockchain scalability (sharding, rollups, new consensus like DAGs) is
encouraging. But any strategy to implement blockchain-based civic systems must include contingency plans
and likely a hybrid approach (using off-chain where appropriate, keeping critical parts on-chain)  until
we’re confident in full on-chain scaling.
21
Privacy Concerns vs. Transparency
Earlier , we praised radical transparency as a tool for accountability. However ,  privacy is a fundamental
right and necessity  for many aspects of civic life. There is an inherent tension: blockchain ledgers are
typically transparent (at least pseudonymously), so how do we ensure individuals’ privacy and prevent
surveillance  or  discrimination?  This  is  especially  pertinent  if  people’s  main  interactions  (economic
transactions, voting, receiving benefits) are on a public ledger . In a worst-case scenario, an overly transparent
system could enable new forms of social control , if, for example, all spending or political donations are
traceable and linked to identities.
Labor rights included aspects of privacy – e.g., the right to secrecy of the union ballot, or protections
against employer snooping into one’s personal life. In a blockchain civic system, we must replicate those
protections. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)  and privacy-preserving cryptography  are the primary tools to
achieve privacy on public ledgers. These allow verification of statements (like “this person is eligible” or “this
vote is valid”) without revealing underlying private data. Projects like Zcash  showed you can have encrypted
transactions that still validate against a ledger via ZKPs. In governance, research prototypes allow secret
ballots on Ethereum  using mixnets or ZKPs, though they are complex and not widely deployed yet.
Another approach is  selective transparency : for example, making aggregate data public but individual
data private. Or having hierarchical access – e.g., a watchdog organization can audit detailed data under
certain conditions, but the general public only sees summaries. This, however , reintroduces some trust in
gatekeepers, so it must be balanced.
The  Worldcoin debate  underscores privacy fears: even if the intentions are good, people worry about a
giant biometric database (even if hashed). Similarly, a global UBI ledger that listed all individuals could be a
juicy  target  for  misuse  (imagine  a  regime  getting  hold  of  it  to  target  dissidents,  etc.).  Therefore,
decentralization must extend to data minimization : store only what is necessary, encrypt wherever
possible, and give individuals agency over their info. Sovrin’s model of  pairwise pseudonymous DIDs  (a
unique DID for each relationship, so it’s hard to correlate activities across contexts) is one way to protect
privacy by design.
Regulatory compliance  is another facet: privacy laws like GDPR demand the right to be forgotten, data
consent, etc. Blockchains by nature don’t forget  (immutability). This is a conflict. Solutions like not putting
personal data on-chain, or using one-way cryptographic commitments that can be “revoked” by losing a key,
are considered. But legal challenges remain; European regulators have pondered whether public blockchain
nodes are effectively data controllers under GDPR. A balanced approach might involve combination of on-
chain and off-chain storage where needed, plus user-controlled encryption keys.
There’s also a risk of de-anonymization  in ostensibly pseudonymous systems. If someone’s addresses or
behavior can be linked (through analytics or hacks or voluntary disclosure), their entire history might
become visible. For example, if a privacy mechanism is weak and someone links your vote to your identity,
your voting record could be exposed – a serious breach of democratic secrecy that labor ballots were
careful  to  guard.  Therefore,  robust  privacy  tech  is  not  optional;  it’s  essential  to  prevent  a  blockchain
Panopticon .
Social acceptance  will depend on privacy guarantees. If people fear that using a blockchain civic system
means sacrificing their privacy, they will resist or seek alternatives (maybe even violent ones if they feel
22
oppressed by surveillance). One could argue many people already give data to private companies with little
care (social media etc.), but when it comes to core rights and money, attitudes can change – plus, handing
data to Facebook is different from it being irrevocably public on a ledger .
In  summary,  any  blockchain-based  civic  contract  must  build  in  strong  privacy  protections  to  be
legitimate and to mirror the freedoms that labor rights and human rights have fought for . This can be done
with technology (ZKPs, differential privacy, etc.) and policy (open governance of what data is collected, with
privacy impact assessments). Getting privacy right will likely involve cutting-edge cryptography and perhaps
a gradual increase in what is made transparent as techniques improve (e.g., maybe start with higher
privacy, then selectively open up data categories that are safe to share and beneficial for accountability).
Legal and Regulatory Uncertainty
The  intersection  of  blockchain  systems  with  existing  legal  and  political  frameworks  is  a  complex  and
evolving area.  Labor rights historically were enshrined in law  – if a company violated them, courts or
regulators could intervene. In a decentralized system, what is the legal status of DAOs, smart contracts,
and digital rights?  Currently, much of the world lacks clear legal recognition for things like DAOs or smart
contracts (though some jurisdictions are pioneering, e.g., Vermont’s blockchain-based LLCs, Wyoming’s DAO
LLC law). 
Uncertainty about liability and enforcement is a major risk.  For instance, if a decentralized UBI smart
contract fails to pay someone due to a bug, can they sue anyone? Who is responsible – the developers
(maybe anonymous), the validators, the DAO token holders? Today’s legal system isn’t well-equipped to
assign liability in such a diffuse context. This could leave individuals without recourse if something goes
wrong. Labor law evolved to allow workers to sue or claim compensation for employer misconduct; in a
blockchain future, if an algorithm mistreats you, can you take an algorithm to court? Possibly regulators will
force there to be some entity that can be held accountable (this is a current debate: making DAOs establish
a legal personality so they can be sued or enter contracts).
Regulatory compliance  is another facet: financial regulations, identity (KYC/AML) rules, data protection
laws – all these apply. Many blockchain initiatives operate in a gray area or deliberately in a decentralized
manner to avoid certain regulations (for better or worse). But when scaling to societal functions, they will
come under scrutiny. For example, if a blockchain voting system is used in a state election, it must comply
with election laws, accessibility requirements, etc. If a decentralized identity is used for legal identity, how
does it reconcile with state-issued documents? Some cooperation with governments might be needed,
which introduces political risk (e.g., governments might demand backdoors or try to co-opt the system for
surveillance).
Governments might also resist  ceding power to decentralized systems. Labor unions often faced hostility
from governments in early days; similarly, one can envision governments viewing a parallel blockchain
social system as undermining their authority. Already, we see varying attitudes: some countries embrace
blockchain for governance (like using it for land registries or voting pilots), others ban crypto (e.g., China
cracked down on crypto, though interestingly still uses some blockchain tech domestically for tracking). If a
government feels threatened – say, people choose a community DAO’s decision over a law – there could be
conflict. For example, what if a global UBI via crypto reduces people’s dependence on a government’s
patronage? That government might ban it to maintain control.
23
Jurisdictional issues : Blockchain networks are borderless, but laws are not. A person might have a “right”
on-chain that is not recognized off-chain in their country, or vice versa. This gap could cause issues. If
someone’s on-chain identity says they are a verified person to receive UBI, but their government says that’s
illegal, they might face penalties for participating. Conversely, if on-chain governance votes to, say, provide
funding to an activity illegal in some country, does that put participants at legal risk? These uncertainties
can deter participation or fracture the system by geography.
Integration with existing institutions : In reality, we may not fully “replace” labor rights enforcement
overnight but rather integrate blockchain solutions into a hybrid model with current institutions. During a
transition, clarity is needed on how smart contracts and DAOs interface with courts, law enforcement, etc.
For instance, if a court orders the seizure of someone’s assets for a crime, and those assets are locked in a
smart contract, how is that executed? Without an interface, authorities might attempt to force miners/
validators to comply (as seen in cases where governments pressured Bitcoin miners or Ethereum validators
to censor certain transactions under sanctions law). This sets up a tension between the uncensorability of
blockchain vs the requirements of law . Resolving this might entail legislation that gives smart contracts
some recognized status – perhaps akin to legal contracts – and also establishing that certain decentralized
governance decisions are binding in law.
Encouragingly, some jurisdictions are working on DAO legal personhood  (e.g., the Marshall Islands passed
a  law  recognizing  DAOs  as  legal  entities).  The  UK  Law  Commission  has  studied  how  English  law  can
accommodate smart contracts and DAOs. These are incremental steps towards a legal framework where,
say, a DAO can own property, hire contractors, and be sued if it violates obligations. That might sound
counter  to  pure  decentralization,  but  it  can  provide  accountability.  The  challenge  is  doing  so  without
undermining the core benefits – if you centralize a DAO just to make it legible to law, you lose much.
In summary, legal ambiguity is a big risk factor  for any large-scale blockchain civic project. It could result
in litigation, enforcement actions (we’ve seen the SEC crack down on certain token projects as unregistered
securities, for example), or user hesitance. Overcoming this will require engagement between technologists
and policymakers to craft new frameworks. The new social contract might not be purely code-based; it will
likely be a combination of code and law. Normatively, one could imagine new laws that  enshrine certain
blockchain-based rights  (e.g., a law might guarantee the right to a digital identity that you control, or
recognize a smart contract-based vote in a cooperative as legally valid). But getting there will take time, and
in the interim, uncertainty itself is a risk  – it may slow adoption or leave early adopters exposed.
Adoption, Accessibility, and the Digital Divide
Even if we build the perfect blockchain systems for a post-labor society,  will people use them?  Will  all
people  be  able  to  use  them?  There  is  a  genuine  risk  that  these  innovations  could  end  up  accessible
primarily to the tech-savvy or the well-resourced, thereby exacerbating inequality instead of reducing it .
Consider that currently, participating in DeFi or DAOs requires at least a modern smartphone or computer ,
reliable  internet,  some  education  on  managing  keys,  and  often  knowledge  of  English  (since  much
documentation/interface is English-centric). Many of the world’s poor – who are supposed to benefit the
most in a world without jobs – lack one or more of these prerequisites .
Digital literacy  is a major barrier . Using blockchain wallets, understanding seed phrases, avoiding scams,
etc., is non-trivial for newcomers. Millions have fallen for phishing scams in crypto or lost funds by user
error . If critical civic rights or income depend on using these tools, those with lower education or tech
24
exposure  might  struggle  or  become  victims  of  fraud.  This  is  analogous  to  how  uneducated  workers
historically were more easily exploited until labor orgs provided education. We might need robust public
education programs in digital finance and security, or design systems so intuitive that even those with
minimal literacy can use them (imagine biometrics to recover keys – though that has its own issues). User
experience (UX)  of blockchain apps must dramatically improve to reach a broad population. The average
person shouldn’t have to know what a “hash” or “gas fee” is to exercise their rights.
Infrastructure access  is another issue. Billions still have limited internet access or none at all. If civic
systems go online and on-chain, those offline are left out – akin to not having a factory job in the industrial
era left one destitute. Expanding internet access (via community networks, satellites like Starlink, etc.) might
be considered part of the new social contract (some argue internet access is a human right now). But if that
doesn’t  happen  quickly,  we  must  ensure  alternative  access  points.  Maybe  community  centers,  local
intermediaries or bridge organizations  (like NGOs helping people access digital services) will play a role.
However , involving intermediaries reintroduces trust and potential gatekeepers.
The elderly and persons with disabilities  might face difficulties with new tech. Labor movements often
fought for inclusivity in the workplace; similarly, we must ensure inclusive design – e.g., voice interfaces for
the blind, multilingual support, accommodating cognitive impairments with simpler flows. The risk is that
early implementations cater to crypto enthusiasts and overlook others.
Cultural barriers : People may not trust a faceless system. Many rely on personal relationships – a local
banker , a government caseworker – and might be uncomfortable dealing with a “black box” algorithm for
their needs. Trust-building measures, like community demonstrations, user-friendly narratives (not just “it’s
decentralized trust us” but showing in concrete terms how it benefits them) will be essential. Otherwise,
adoption might skew to younger , urban populations, leaving others in legacy systems and potentially worse
off if resources shift to the new system.
Transition period complexities : During any changeover , there will be a mix of old and new systems. People
might have to juggle both, causing confusion. If not handled carefully, this could lead to some falling
through cracks (imagine someone failing to claim their blockchain UBI because they missed some step,
similar to how some don’t claim benefits they’re entitled to due to bureaucracy today).
Another risk is  public perception and backlash . Blockchain is often associated in media with scams,
volatility, or libertarian agendas. Rolling out blockchain-based governance might face skepticism (“Is this
just a new Bitcoin scam?”) or ideological resistance (“We don’t want governance by algorithm”). Effective
communication and gradual introduction of these tools in a way that highlights their tangible benefits will
be necessary. Otherwise, political pushback could scrap good initiatives (for instance, a city’s plan for
blockchain budgeting might get derailed by controversy if not explained well).
Finally, the  global divide : adoption may advance faster in some regions than others. If some countries
forge ahead with, say, DAO-based governance and others lag, this could create international imbalances.
Perhaps in progressive wealthy societies, labor may be obsolete and blockchain systems in place, while in
poorer or more traditional economies, labor might still be in use but with weakened rights and no new
system to fill the gap – essentially the worst of both worlds locally. This scenario could drive even more
migration or brain drain to places where the new social contract is implemented, widening inequality
between countries. Ideally, these technologies should be used to uplift the globally marginalized, not just
25
the already advanced. That will require international cooperation and knowledge transfer , akin to how labor
standards were promoted across borders via organizations like the ILO (International Labour Organization).
In summary,  the risk of leaving people behind is real . It would be a cruel irony if the tools meant to
empower the masses in a post-labor world ended up empowering primarily a tech-savvy elite. Avoiding this
outcome means investing in education, ensuring intuitive design, bridging digital divides, and phasing
changes in a humane way. Essentially, “no person left behind” should be a guiding principle, as it was for
labor  advocates  fighting  child  labor ,  sweatshops,  etc.  If  we  treat  access  to  the  blockchain-based  civic
infrastructure  as  we  did  access  to  basic  education  in  the  20th  century  (a  necessity  for  all),  and  plan
accordingly, we can mitigate this risk.
New Forms of Exploitation and Abuse
Every technology can be misused, and blockchain is no exception. We must be vigilant for novel forms of
exploitation  that could arise in a blockchain-governed society, so that preventing them can be part of the
design (just as labor law evolved to curb new exploitative practices during industrialization).
One concern is “economic coercion by protocol” . For example, imagine a scenario where an entity (could
be an AI corporation, or a wealthy individual) accumulates a large share of a governance token and then
bribes or extorts the community  to sway decisions (“I’ll dump the token and crash your system unless you
pay me or pass this proposal”). This is a sort of hostile takeover akin to company raids, but at a societal
scale. Mechanisms like  quadratic voting  help by making buying influence more expensive, but aren’t
foolproof  if  someone  is  resourceful  enough.  We  might  need  anti-bribery  techniques  (there’s  blockchain
research on vote-privacy to prevent vote-buying, etc.). 
Another risk is digital fraud and scams  targeting individuals. If everyone has a blockchain wallet for their
UBI or identity, scammers will target them (phishing for keys, fake support lines, etc.). We already see
endless crypto scams – these could proliferate as more regular folks enter the space, potentially wiping out
livelihoods. Without an employer or government fallback, a person scammed out of their crypto savings is
in trouble. Traditional finance has fraud protections (banks can reverse transactions in some cases, etc.),
whereas blockchain typically doesn’t. So new protections are needed, perhaps community-run insurance
funds or reputational systems to mark malicious addresses. 
Data harvesting and profiling  could become a new exploitation method. Even with pseudonyms, big data
analytics might find patterns linking transactions to individuals, enabling companies or political actors to
profile people extensively. For instance, if vote tokens or preferences leak, one could build dossiers to
manipulate  communities,  akin  to  Cambridge  Analytica  but  with  richer  data.  Labor  unions  historically
protected workers from some employer surveillance; in the future, who protects citizens from blockchain
analytics? This ties back to privacy and the importance of ZKPs.
We should also consider  algorithmic bias or errors causing harm . If more of life is governed by smart
contracts  or  DAOs,  a  flaw  in  their  logic  (or  a  bias  in  an  AI  oracle  feeding  them)  could  systematically
disadvantage some group. For instance, if an AI decides on resource distribution and has bias in training
data, it might allocate less to certain demographics. With labor unions and democracy, those groups could
protest; in a fully coded system, the bias might go unaddressed unless consciously monitored. Ensuring
algorithmic accountability  and the ability for humans to correct unfair outcomes is crucial (even if code is
26
“law”, there must be a legal or governance override when code is unjust – a lesson from The DAO, where
humans intervened).
Exploitation of loopholes : savvy actors might find unintended ways to game blockchain systems, similar to
regulatory arbitrage in finance. For example, someone might create thousands of Sybil identities that slip
past proof-of-personhood if the system isn’t airtight, and claim many UBI shares – depriving the real people
of resources. Or malicious validators could collude to censor certain users (imagine a future where a
consortium of validators doesn’t like the political leanings of a community and blacklists their transactions).
These are exploits of governance and infrastructure that need contingency plans (like diverse validator sets,
social slashing where the community forks away from bad actors, etc., but those are drastic and messy
remedies).
Criminal misuse : Just as criminals use crypto for money laundering, they could use decentralized identity
to mask activities or DAOs to coordinate illicit enterprises out of reach of law (there have been cases like a
dark  net  marketplace  considering  itself  a  DAO).  If  law  enforcement  finds  itself  hamstrung  by  strong
encryption and decentralized networks, there could be a backlash or an arms race undermining the stability
of the system. Society will have to adapt legal processes (e.g., forensic blockchain analysis is growing, but
criminals adapt too, using mixers etc.). The new social contract has to include ways to address crime and
disputes – areas where historically the state (and indirectly labor through union-backed political movements
for rule of law) played a role.
Loss of human oversight and empathy : One could see as a form of exploitation if people become at the
mercy of rigid algorithmic rules with no flexibility. Labor negotiations allowed for human factors (hardship
cases, special exceptions). In a purely code-run welfare distribution, someone who loses a key or makes an
error might get no recourse – that could feel exploitative or at least inhumane. We may need built-in “circuit
breakers”  not  just  for  hacks  but  for  mercy:  e.g.,  community  moderators  who  can,  by  multi-signature
consensus, restore someone’s access or grant an exception in edge cases (though that introduces a bit of
centralization – always a trade-off).
Finally,  unequal influence through technology : There’s a risk that those who build and maintain these
blockchain systems (developers, large node operators) become a new elite if they are not accountable. In
labor  terms,  this  is  like  the  managerial  or  technical  class  having  power  over  workers.  If  open-source
communities remain meritocratic but also somewhat dominated by Western developers, the system could
inadvertently  encode  their  values  and  overlook  others’.  Ensuring  diverse  participation  in  protocol
development is important to avoid exploitation via cultural bias or neglect of certain communities’ needs.
In summary,  vigilance for new exploitation vectors is essential . Many of these boil down to  power
imbalances re-emerging in different guises  – whether through wealth, technical savvy, or algorithmic
control. The design of a blockchain-based civic contract should incorporate checks akin to how labor rights
laws had checks on corporate power . This could include: anti-monopoly rules for token holdings, continuous
auditing of algorithms for fairness, emergency human governance layers for redress, community insurance
and  support  schemes  for  those  who  suffer  losses,  etc.  Just  as  the  early  industrial  age  had  to  invent
regulatory and social innovations to tackle child labor , sweatshops, company towns (where workers were
paid in company script usable only at company stores – interestingly analogous to potentially being locked
into one platform’s token ecosystem), the blockchain age will need new rules to tackle the issues above.

Having mapped the major limitations and risks, it’s clear that technology alone is not enough  – the social and
governance  layer  around  it  is  equally  vital.  In  the  next  section,  we  will  shift  to  a  constructive  mode:
proposing frameworks, norms, and policy ideas for  designing a blockchain-based civic contract  that
maximizes the benefits we discussed while mitigating these pitfalls. 
Proposals and Frameworks for a Blockchain-Based Civic Contract
Designing a new civic contract for a world beyond labor is a profound challenge – one that demands not
only technical innovation but also institutional creativity and ethical grounding. In this section, we outline
normative proposals and frameworks  that could guide the development of a  blockchain-based social
contract . These recommendations synthesize insights from the case studies, attempt to address the risks
discussed,  and  draw  inspiration  from  political  economy  and  systems  theory.  The  goal  is  to  imagine
structures that restore equilibrium and fairness in a society where traditional labor leverage is gone, using
blockchain and cryptography as foundational tools.
We organize the proposals into key areas:
Democratic Governance Models for Decentralized Systems  – ensuring broad, equitable
participation and preventing elite capture in blockchain governance (e.g., quadratic voting,
soulbound reputation tokens).
Economic Security and Public Goods in a Post-Work Economy  – mechanisms like blockchain-
based UBI, AI dividends, and decentralized public goods funding to replace the income and social
safety functions of labor .
Data Dignity and Digital Rights  – policies to guarantee individuals control over their data, identity,
and privacy, akin to labor rights for the digital self.
Accountability and Rule of Law in Algorithmic Governance  – frameworks for auditing and
intervening in smart contract systems to align with human values and legal norms, including
integrating with traditional institutions.
Bridging the Transition  – strategies for implementation, education, and inclusion to ensure a
smooth transition to these new systems without leaving anyone behind.
Throughout, we will use bullet points and structured heuristics where applicable to make the ideas clear . We
will also cite analogous ideas from thinkers and related movements. For example, Glen Weyl and colleagues’
concept  of  a  “Decentralized  Society  (DeSoc)”  and  soulbound  tokens  (SBTs)  offers  a  rich  vision  of
embedding  trust  and  cooperation  in  Web3,  which  we  incorporate.  Likewise,  concepts  of  open
cooperativism  and “radical markets”  inform our proposals for shared ownership and governance.
1. Embrace Pluralistic Governance: Quadratic Voting, DAOs with Soulbound Tokens,
and Participatory Polity
To prevent the concentration of power and ensure that  post-labor governance is truly by and for the
people ,  we  propose  a  multi-faceted  democratic  governance  framework  for  blockchain-based
institutions:
Adopt Quadratic Voting/Funding as a Standard:  Decision-making in decentralized systems (be it
allocating funds, or voting on policies) should use quadratic mechanisms  to amplify the voice of the
many  over  the  money  of  the  few.  In  quadratic  voting,  each  additional  vote  for  a  choice  costs• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
28
exponentially  more  tokens,  so  stakeholders  with  limited  tokens  can  collectively  outweigh  a  wealthy
minority . This should be baked into DAO platforms and considered for any collective choice – from
budgeting  public  resources  (as  Gitcoin  does)  to  electing  representatives  in  a  decentralized
community.  Quadratic  funding  should  likewise  be  the  norm  for  public  goods  financing,  as  it
“ensures  everyone  has  a  voice,  no  matter  the  size  of  their  donation”.  These  mechanisms
operationalize the principle of political equality that labor unions fought for in the workplace, now
applied to the digital commons.
Leverage Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) for Merit and Trust:  Introduce non-transferable “soulbound”
tokens  to  represent  individual  credentials,  commitments,  and  reputations  in  DAO  governance.
Because SBTs cannot be sold, they serve as proof of past contributions and trustworthiness  rather
than wealth. For example, an environmental DAO could issue SBTs to volunteers who have done
community work; those SBTs might grant extra voice on proposals about environmental issues (since
those individuals have proven commitment). This idea resonates with giving “one person, one vote”
in worker co-ops, but more granular – one contribution, one unit of earned influence . In the envisioned
Decentralized Society (DeSoc) , Souls (individuals) carry a basket of such SBTs that encode their
affiliations and achievements, enabling richer ,  pluralistic  governance that rewards cooperation and
long-term involvement. By using SBTs, we reduce the risk of plutocracy and Sybil attacks: you can’t
buy reputation or easily fake a history of community service. Heuristic:  Whenever designing a DAO
or tokenized decision system, ask “Can we replace or augment a transferable token with a soulbound
credential that better captures what we value?”
Participatory Budgeting and Policy DAOs:  Create DAOs at various levels (local, sectoral, global)
where  citizens  can  directly  vote  on  budgets  and  policies .  This  draws  from  the  concept  of
participatory  budgeting  (successfully  tried  in  cities  like  Porto  Alegre)  but  executed  via  smart
contracts for transparency. For instance, a city could have a  CityDAO  where residents (verified by
decentralized ID) vote on how to allocate a public fund – perhaps using quadratic voting to rank
projects. In a world without labor unions negotiating municipal spending or welfare, this gives
citizens a new lever to influence resource distribution. Because the voting and funding would be on-
chain, results are enforced automatically  (money goes where the vote decided) and visible to all ,
reducing  corruption.  Policy  proposal  DAOs  could  similarly  crowdsource  and  vote  on  proposals
which the elected government is compelled (or at least morally pressured) to consider . Over time, as
these prove their reliability, government functions might even be delegated to them by law (for
example, a law could stipulate that a certain percentage of budget  must  follow the outcome of a
citizen DAO’s decision).
Multi-Stakeholder Governance Councils:  Not everything can or should be decided by direct mass
vote. Borrowing from  co-determination models  (like worker representation on company boards),
establish  governance  councils  for  major  blockchain  networks  or  public  DAOs  that  include
representatives of various stakeholder groups : developers, users, perhaps randomly selected
citizens (a “citizen jury”), and even AI (if representing algorithmic stakeholders). These councils can
serve as a check and deliberative body, providing expert input and oversight on code upgrades or
emergency  situations.  Crucially,  they  should  be  accountable  –  e.g.,  council  members  could  be
periodically confirmed or rotated via community vote/SBT merit, and their discussions should be
recorded publicly (except where privacy requires otherwise). This introduces a  systems-theoretic
feedback loop : the council can be seen as a moderator subsystem ensuring the overall system• 
• 
• 
29
doesn’t veer into unstable or unjust states (analogous to how labor arbitration councils resolved
disputes, but here proactively guiding protocol evolution). 
Constitutional DAO and Algorithmic Ombudsman:  At the highest level, consider establishing a
“Constitutional  DAO”  which  encodes  fundamental  principles  (e.g.,  privacy  rights,  non-
discrimination, right to appeal) that all other smart contracts and DAOs in the ecosystem must
adhere  to,  somewhat  like  a  digital  constitution.  This  DAO’s  membership  could  include  broadly
trusted figures or entities and perhaps every citizen via an SBT of citizenship. It would have the
power to review and veto (or mandate changes to) smart contracts or policies that violate core
principles (e.g., a DAO proposal that attempts to exclude a minority group would be struck down for
violating the equality clause). Additionally, an Algorithmic Ombudsman  function can be created –
an  AI  or  human-AI  committee  that  continuously  audits  algorithms  for  bias  or  errors  and  field
complaints from users who feel wronged by automated decisions, working with the Constitutional
DAO to remedy issues. This ensures that  unstoppable code does not become unaccountable
code . Essentially, this is a governance layer above code , something technologists like Vitalik Buterin
have suggested in advocating for “explicit social governance” to override code in extreme cases.
While it may seem to reintroduce human control, it’s humans collectively via transparent processes,
not opaque bureaucrats. 
These governance proposals align with the idea that  pluralism and broad participation create more
resilient and fair systems . In effect, we’re recombining the  civic structures that balanced industrial
capital  (unions, democratic legislatures, works councils) into new forms suited for decentralized networks.
By doing so, we aim to replicate the bargaining power and voice that labor provided, but in a digitally-
mediated, post-work context.
2. Economic Security for All: Blockchain-Based Universal Basic Income and Public
Ownership of Productive Capital
One of the core promises to fulfill in a world without labor is that everyone’s basic needs and well-being
are ensured , even when wages are no longer the norm. This was historically addressed through labor
wages,  union-won  benefits,  and  welfare  states  funded  by  labor  taxes.  We  propose  a  combination  of
blockchain-driven economic mechanisms to guarantee economic security and to socialize the gains
of AI/robotics :
Implement a Universal Basic Income (UBI) via Smart Contracts:  Establish a UBI DAO  that
regularly disburses a base income to every verified person (using the proof-of-personhood identity
system). Funds could come from various sources – for example, a portion of taxes or fees collected
from AI companies (see below on AI dividends), voluntary contributions, or even newly minted
crypto if managed carefully to avoid inflation. The payout mechanism  would be a smart contract
where, say, every month it checks the list of eligible World IDs (or Sovrin DIDs marked as citizen) and
sends each a fixed amount of digital currency. This is done automatically, without bureaucratic
delay or discrimination , and with full transparency  of the aggregate outflow (ensuring public
oversight that the program isn’t being gutted). Some projects like Circles UBI and Proof of
Humanity’s UBI token have piloted this, but a larger scale implementation might use a stablecoin for
predictable value. Key design elements:• 
• 
30
Use tiered UBI  if necessary: e.g., a global minimum and optional supplemental UBI from local
communities or nations (where local DAOs can top-up the global amount based on cost of living or
policy choices).
Build in opt-in community service linking : not to make UBI conditional (it should remain
unconditional to avoid replicating labor coercion), but to encourage contributions, UBI recipients
could be nudged to volunteer or take courses, earning additional SBT credentials that might qualify
them for bonuses or just to build social capital. This ties into Glen Weyl’s notion that UBI alone is not
enough without a productive model around it ; we plug UBI into a larger ecosystem of commons-based
production and cooperative work (discussed further below). 
Ensure  funding sustainability : The UBI DAO should have a clear revenue model (likely through
taxing capital or commons revenue) to continuously fund payments. A normative proposal  is that a
portion of all gains from automation should flow into the UBI DAO . This can be achieved by smart
contract “taxes” on transactions of certain tokens or through agreed profit-sharing (for example, if
an AI is deployed commercially, its smart contract could automatically remit X% of revenue to the
UBI pool).
Create an “AI Dividend” – Common Ownership of Automated Capital : In line with thinkers like
Yanis  Varoufakis  or  tech  leaders  (Altman)  who  suggested  taxing  AI,  we  propose  a  more  direct
approach:  tokenize  the  ownership  of  AI/robotics  enterprises  and  distribute  those  tokens
widely to the public , so that capital income is shared. Concretely:
For each major AI/robotic project (say a company deploying autonomous vehicles or an advanced AI
service), require that a significant share of its equity or revenue is represented by a token that is
held by a public trust  or distributed as “Citizen Tokens”  to all. These tokens entitle holders to
dividends (profits) or usage rights of the service.
Use smart contracts to automate the collection and distribution  of these dividends. For instance,
if an AI DAO generates profits from selling services, its code could split the profit: reinvest some, and
send the rest to a “Public Wealth Fund”  contract. This public fund then periodically distributes to
individuals (possibly feeding into the UBI system). Alternatively, it could fund public goods like
education, healthcare – replicating what taxes used to fund, but via protocol.
Essentially, this treats productive AI and infrastructure as part of the commons  from which all
should benefit, an idea akin to “technological socialism” or “open cooperativism”. The blockchain
ensures transparency: anyone can see that, say, the World AI Fund smart contract  received X from
company Y this quarter and paid out Z per person or Z to local project grants, etc.
Heuristic/Framework:  Implement  a  “Commons  Contribution  Protocol”  where  any  automated
system above a certain productivity threshold must be plugged into a smart contract that enforces
contribution to the commons (similar in spirit to carbon credits but for automation). This can be
voluntary or mandated by new policies. One can imagine a policy DAO coalition  lobbying for such
integration, making it a social norm or legal requirement.
Decentralized Public Goods Provision through DAOs:  Expand on Gitcoin’s model to broader public
goods:  not  just  open  software,  but  research,  environmental  restoration,  infrastructure.  Launch
specialized  Public Goods DAOs  (or Quadratic Funding rounds) for areas like healthcare research,
local community improvement, journalism, etc. These DAOs use  crowd sentiment and matching
funds  to  allocate  resources.  Funding  can  come  from  the  AI  Dividend  above,  philanthropy,  or
government  budgets  rechanneled  through  these  mechanisms.  This  democratizes  how  public• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
31
resources are used, effectively replacing what was often negotiated in political processes heavily
influenced by labor groups, with a more direct participatory process. 
Example: A Health DAO  receives a pot each year (from a global health token, funded by a Tobin tax
on pharma profits or something); citizens vote on which health issues or research to prioritize
(perhaps with quadratic voting to ensure broad consensus). Funds are then granted accordingly via
smart contract. This introduces participatory planning  into domains traditionally top-down, guided by
collective intelligence.
Encourage  Platform  Cooperatives  and  Data  Unions :  Use  blockchain  to  facilitate  cooperative
ownership models  for digital platforms and data. For instance, drivers of a ride-sharing service
could form a DAO coop, each with tokens earned by driving, collectively owning the platform. Smart
contracts would distribute revenue among drivers based on clear rules, and drivers vote on policies
(like  price  setting  or  introducing  services).  This  is  essentially  using  blockchain  to  scale  the
cooperative movement, which historically gave workers stake and voice (Mondragon etc.), into the
era of gig work and digital platforms. The regulatory proposal  here is to treat algorithmic platforms
as utilities that workers can collectively run, or at least ensure any platform using gig labor issues
“labor tokens”  to its workers, representing profit shares.
Similarly, Data Unions : groups of individuals pool their personal data and negotiate its sale to AI
firms via smart contracts (ensuring anonymity and fair compensation). Projects like Ocean Protocol
and Streamr have piloted aspects of this. The idea is to treat individuals’ data contributions as a form
of labor/capital that must be paid. Glen Weyl calls this “data as labor” , aligned with giving
individuals property rights over their data. A normative framework could require AI companies to
obtain data through such consensual unions rather than free scraping, enforced by law or by the
data providers only releasing through these protocols.
The  overarching  theme  of  these  proposals  is  to  institutionalize  economic  solidarity  and  shared
prosperity through code . In effect, we are trying to simulate what strong unions and social democracies
achieved – wage floors, profit-sharing, public goods – through automated, global and participatory means.
This addresses the system-theory insight that without labor’s counterweight, wealth concentrates; so we
build feedback loops  (UBI, AI dividends) that automatically redistribute wealth and maintain equilibrium. 
It’s also aligned with Polanyi’s idea of re-embedding the market in society  – here, we embed markets in
smart contract rules that reflect social goals (like universal welfare) instead of pure profit. Importantly, these
mechanisms should be enshrined in a binding way  (like the UBI contract runs autonomously, not at the
whim of political cycles), giving individuals predictable security. 
A  cautionary  point:  “UBI  alone  is  not  enough”  –  it  should  be  part  of  a  holistic  model  including
opportunities  for  meaningful  participation  in  production  and  community .  Hence,  we  emphasize
cooperatives and public goods work, so people can still find purpose and contribute even if traditional jobs
are scarce. Blockchain can support that by lowering coordination costs (co-ops across borders, micro-
contributions recognized via tokens, etc.). •

3. Self-Sovereign Identity and Data Dignity: A Bill of Digital Rights
Just as labor rights came with a notion of respecting the worker’s humanity (no exploitation, right to privacy,
freedom of association), a blockchain-based society needs a Bill of Digital Rights  to protect individuals in
the digital realm. Key proposals include:
Universal Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI):  Make self-sovereign identity a public good and a human
right . Concretely, every person from birth (or whenever they come online) should be provisioned –
perhaps by a public authority in collaboration with open-source projects – a sovereign digital
identity wallet  that they (or their guardians) control. This wallet holds their credentials (citizenship,
education, etc.) as verifiable credentials (VCs)  signed by issuers, and only the individual can
consent to sharing them. Governments and institutions would need to legally recognize these
credentials (e.g., recognize a digital diploma or license presented via SSI as legally valid). 
Policy idea:  Pass “ Right to Identity and Data Ownership ” laws that ensure individuals own their
personal data and credentials, similar to property rights. For instance, California’s Consumer Privacy
Act hints at this, but we can go further: any organization collecting personal data must issue it back to
the individual in a machine-readable, portable format (perhaps as a verifiable credential) for their SSI
wallet . This flips data control.
Implementation  framework:  Use  existing  standards  (DID,  VC)  and  networks  like  Sovrin  or
Ethereum-based identity to roll out national SSI programs. Some countries (Estonia, etc.) are close –
they give e-ID with cryptographic keys to citizens. The proposal is to anchor these in decentralized
networks rather than government databases where possible, to ensure censorship-resistance and
global interoperability.
Zero-Knowledge Proof Infrastructure for Privacy:  Invest in and deploy  zero-knowledge proof
systems  at scale for everyday interactions. This means:
Voting systems where you prove you’re eligible and have voted, without revealing who you voted for .
Age/attribute proofs (prove over 18 without giving birthdate, etc.), important for preserving privacy
in on-chain KYC or accessing age-limited services without creating databases of personal info.
Financial transactions where amounts or identities can be shielded unless certain conditions (like a
legal warrant) are met – e.g., using Zcash-like shielded transactions for government aid
disbursements to protect recipients’ financial privacy.
Essentially, make privacy tech the default in public systems: “Privacy by design”  should be
mandated. Any new social dApp (decentralized app) that handles personal data should integrate
ZKPs or privacy layers, and get perhaps certification (like privacy “UL listed”).
Normative goal:  Achieve radical transparency for systems and institutions, but radical privacy
for individuals  – a principle often voiced by transparency advocates. For example, a public budget
DAO’s overall flows are transparent, but individuals’ personal balances or choices remain private
unless they choose to disclose.
Decentralized Data Governance and Consent:  Give individuals fine-grained consent tools  through
their identity wallet for how their data is used. This can be done with smart contracts:
Example: A person’s SSI wallet could have a “data vault”  where third parties can request access to
certain data, but the individual’s agent sets conditions (maybe even micropayment required, or only• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
33
for a limited time, etc.). Solid (Tim Berners-Lee’s project) and others envision such personal data
pods. Blockchain could facilitate logging all access in an immutable way, so misuse can be traced
(like an audit log – “which entities accessed my data and for what purpose”).
Establish Data Unions  (as mentioned) where people pool and collectively negotiate data sharing –
this not only provides compensation but also an additional layer of consent (the union’s smart
contract might only share aggregate data or only with ethical AI projects, etc., as determined by
members).
Legal  reinforcement:  Expand  privacy  laws  to  give  teeth  to  personal  data  rights  –  e.g.,  heavy
penalties for companies that take data without a credentialed proof of user consent. Possibly create
an international Data Rights Organization  similar to the ILO for labor , but focused on digital rights, to
set standards that tech cos and governments should follow.
Right to Algorithmic Explanation and Appeal:  People should have the right to understand and
challenge automated decisions  that affect them (echoing the “right to explanation” in GDPR). In a
blockchain context:
If a smart contract denies someone a benefit or flags them as suspicious, they need a method to
inquire “why?” and an avenue to appeal (perhaps to that Algorithmic Ombudsman or Constitutional
DAO mentioned). 
Heuristic:  Design smart contracts with an “appeal function”  – e.g., funds are not permanently lost or
an action not permanently taken until a short window passes where the user can submit an appeal
(could be a transaction with evidence to a designated DAO arbitrator). Only after that window, the
action finalizes. This introduces a bit of delay (and someone must handle appeals), but it builds trust
that the system isn’t absolute and unfeeling.
For less critical things, at least provide transparency of algorithmic rules (if it doesn’t compromise
security). If an AI is used, perhaps use open source AI or auditable AI  so that biases can be spotted.
A person might not get a personalized explanation from a neural net easily, but they should get an
audit trail  – e.g., “these were the input factors and weights that led to the decision in your case.”
Guarantee  of  Digital  Access  and  Education:  Recognize  that  having  digital  identity  and  rights
means nothing if one cannot access the digital realm. So a blockchain-era social contract should
include:
Universal internet access  – consider internet connectivity a public utility. Possibly fund it partly via
aforementioned Public Goods DAOs (there are projects like RightMesh or low-orbit satellites for this).
Public digital education  – community centers or online curricula to teach individuals how to use
their identity wallets, protect themselves from scams, and engage in DAOs. This is analogous to how
unions often educated workers, or how public schools prepared citizens – now digital literacy is civic
literacy. 
Inclusive design mandates  – as part of digital rights, require that critical services (like a UBI app or
voting app) adhere to accessibility guidelines (for disabled, elderly). This might mean providing
alternative interfaces: voice command, translations, etc., likely a role for government or
philanthropic funding to ensure no one’s identity/rights are inaccessible due to design neglect.
By codifying these rights and mechanisms, we aim for a digital world that treats personal autonomy and
dignity as sacrosanct , much as the labor movement insisted a worker is not just a cog but a human with• 
• 
•

• 
• 
• 
34
rights.  A  citizen  in  the  blockchain  society  should  feel  in  control  of  their  digital  self  (identity,  data,
reputation) , not controlled by either states or corporations. This fosters trust in the new systems – people
will adopt digital governance if they feel their rights are protected, just as workers embraced labor laws
once they saw protections. 
This “Bill of Digital Rights” could be literally encoded as a set of guiding principles that DAOs pledge to
uphold (possibly enforced by the Constitutional DAO across the ecosystem). It aligns with Don Tapscott’s call
for a new social contract where trust and privacy are fundamental. And in systems terms, it ensures the
feedback loops of trust and legitimacy : if people see their data isn’t misused and their identity isn’t
hijacked, they’ll continue to legitimize and participate in the system, making it stable and resilient.
4. Hybrid Governance: Integrating Code and Institutions for Accountability
While much of this report envisions decentralized protocols doing what institutions used to, a pragmatic
approach acknowledges that existing institutions (governments, courts, NGOs) will still play a role  and
that blending the strengths of code and human judgment yields the best outcomes. We propose  hybrid
governance frameworks  to ensure accountability, legal compliance, and flexibility:
Legal Recognition and Chartering of DAOs:  Encourage a system where important DAOs (ones
managing large public funds or critical services) operate under a  “charter”  that is filed in a legal
jurisdiction, essentially getting the rights of a legal entity (as in Wyoming’s DAO LLC law). The charter
would set out the DAO’s purpose, governance mechanisms, and include a pledge to uphold the Bill
of  Digital  Rights  and  other  constitutional  principles.  This  provides  a  bridge  between  on-chain
operations and off-chain law – e.g., a DAO could be sued if it breaches its charter or causes harm,
and it can also access legal systems if needed (like owning real-world property or signing contracts
through an elected legal representative). This is similar to how labor unions themselves incorporated
and  had  legal  standings  to  negotiate  and  sue.  The  key  is  to  do  this  without  undermining
decentralization: the charter should largely point to the code/DAO rules as the source of truth, but
adds a wrapper for interfacing with legacy systems.
Regulatory Nodes and Oracles:  Bring regulators into the loop by having them run  “observer
nodes”  on public blockchains (many regulators already do this for monitoring). Additionally, create
regulated oracle services  that supply data like exchange rates, identity validity, or blacklists of
known  sanctioned  entities  to  smart  contracts.  This  way,  compliance  (e.g.,  with  anti-money
laundering laws or sanctioned entity bans) can be automated, reducing friction between the crypto
world and regulators. For instance, a UBI contract for a certain country could use a government-
provided oracle that confirms the person is a citizen (without revealing who, by ZKP) so that it doesn’t
pay non-citizens if it’s not supposed to, etc. 
One  controversial  but  potentially  necessary  area:  digital  courts  or  arbitration  for  on-chain
disputes . There are projects like Kleros which act as a decentralized jury for smart contract disputes.
Promoting such mechanisms means not every on-chain issue needs to go to a state court – we can
resolve  many  with  community  jurors  (whose  decisions  are  then  enforced  by  smart  contracts).
However , connecting these to state courts for final appeals or enforcement of off-chain actions (like
compelling someone to do something physical) is also needed. So perhaps a network of arbitration
DAOs  recognized by international treaty could be an innovation – a modern version of international
arbitration but transparent and crowd-sourced.• 
• 
• 
35
Algorithmic  Transparency  and  Certification:  For  algorithms  that  impact  many  (like  an  AI
controlling UBI distribution or moderating content on a decentralized network), set up independent
oversight bodies  – akin to how food and drugs get FDA approval, we might have Algorithm Auditing
DAOs  that certify an algorithm meets certain fairness and safety criteria. This could involve security
audits  (to  avoid  The  DAO  bugs),  bias  audits  (ensuring  an  AI’s  outcomes  don’t  systematically
disadvantage  a  group),  and  performance  audits  (does  it  do  what  it  claims  effectively?).  These
oversight DAOs could include experts and citizen representatives, blending expertise with legitimacy.
Their findings would be published on-chain (e.g., an NFT badge to the algorithm’s contract indicating
compliance).  Policymakers  could  mandate  that  critical  algorithms  have  such  certification.  This
echoes  how  labor  laws  mandated  things  like  safety  inspections;  here  it’s  algorithmic  safety
inspections.
Crisis Management Protocols:  One thing human-run systems handle (not always well, but there’s
structure) is crises – wars, economic collapses, pandemics. In a blockchain-run world, we should
prepare protocols for emergencies:
For instance, incorporate a “pause switch”  in major contracts that can be invoked if something
catastrophic is happening (like a severe hack or a bug causing huge losses). But guard it: require,
say, a multi-signature of a diverse group (the constitutional DAO members, maybe plus an
automated trigger if funds drain too fast). Make the use of such a switch transparent and temporary,
with a clear plan for resolution. This is analogous to how stock markets have circuit breakers to
pause trading in a crash.
Develop disaster recovery DAOs  – essentially mutual aid networks encoded in smart contracts to
mobilize funds and help in an emergency. These could be funded by a small tax in good times (like
insurance). For example, a Climate Disaster DAO that automatically releases aid to regions hit by
disaster (verified by oracles) could complement or even replace slow government aid processes. It’s a
new-age  Red  Cross  but  with  funds  and  volunteers  managed  by  smart  contracts  and  local
autonomous chapters. This continues the labor movement tradition of mutual aid societies but at
scale and speed.
Education  and  Deliberation  Phases:  Borrowing  from  democratic  innovations  (like  citizens’
assemblies), incorporate  deliberative phases  in major decisions. For example, if the global UBI
amount or AI dividend rate is to be adjusted, don’t just throw it to an immediate vote; have a
discussion  period  where  experts  present  arguments,  simulations  are  run  (perhaps  using  AI
modeling  outcomes),  and  citizen  panels  (randomly  selected  token  holders)  debate  and  issue  a
recommendation.  Then  token  holders  vote.  This  two-step  process  (deliberation  then  decision)
mitigates rash or uninformed choices that pure direct voting can produce. It’s the age-old balancing
of direct democracy with considered judgment, now facilitated by online tools and maybe DAOs
specifically set up to deliberate (like Pol.is surveys or etc. integrated into DAO governance).
Collaboration with Governments on Transitional Policies:  While building blockchain solutions,
work with forward-thinking governments to implement transitional hybrid policies . For instance, a
government might run a pilot where a portion of welfare benefits are delivered via a crypto-UBI to a
digital  wallet,  to  test  the  system  under  their  umbrella  (like  the  city  of  Seoul’s  blockchain  ID
initiatives).  Or  governments  could  adopt  Quadratic  Voting  for  participatory  budgeting  at
municipal levels (as some have started doing with paper , but blockchain can make it easier and more•

trustworthy). These not only provide testing ground but also get buy-in from public officials and
smooth the regulatory path.
The underlying rationale is that human institutions and decentralized code should complement rather
than supplant each other . Code can provide consistency, transparency, and efficiency; institutions provide
judgment, legitimacy, and adaptability. A systems-theoretical view sees this as creating a resilient socio-
technical system with multiple feedback channels: on-chain mechanisms handle routine equilibrium, but
off-chain institutions monitor the meta-level and intervene if the system’s goals (like fairness or stability) are
drifting.
Historically, labor rights emerged from both grassroots pressure and enlightened institutional response;
similarly,  a  fair  blockchain  order  will  require  both  bottom-up  community  action  and  top-down  legal
frameworks. The proposals above aim to embed the new social contract in both code and law , so that each
reinforces  the  other .  This  echoes  Tapscott’s  notion  of  needing  a  new  social  contract  among  business,
government, and civil society in the blockchain era – here business might be largely AI-driven, but still, all
sectors must collaborate.
5. Building the New Equilibrium: Education, Inclusion, and Evolution
Finally, beyond structural design, a successful transition to a blockchain-based civic society needs soft
infrastructure: education, inclusive practices, and iterative refinement . Key proposals:
Digital  Literacy  as  a  Fundamental  Civic  Skill:  Launch  a  massive  global  initiative  to  provide
education on digital finance, blockchain use, and civic technology . This could be like a modern
WPA  project  employing  people  (since  jobs  might  be  scarce)  as  trainers  or  content  creators  for
educational  materials.  Imagine  something  like  “One  Person,  One  Node”  campaign  –  teaching
people not only how to use a wallet but even how to run a node or participate in network validation
if they want. Demystify the tech; use popular education techniques akin to how labor organizers
taught workers about economics and law. This is important for equity: without education, early
adopters (often already privileged) dominate, so making knowledge accessible equalizes the playing
field for influence in the new system.
Inclusivity and Co-creation:  Ensure that  diverse communities are involved in designing and
governing these systems from the outset . That means proactively reaching out to marginalized
groups (the poor , minorities, those in developing nations) and including them in pilot programs and
DAO  governance.  Use  multilingual  interfaces  and  outreach  (something  often  lacking  in  crypto
projects which are English-centric). One could set up Global Assembly DAOs  – think of it as a digital
United Nations – where representatives (perhaps elected via communities or randomly selected
citizens) from all over deliberate on cross-border issues of the new economy (like climate, global UBI
parameters, etc.). This gives a sense of shared ownership of the new social contract across humanity,
not just tech hubs. It also helps prevent the system from encoding biases of a few (the “West Coast”
tech ideology, etc.) by bringing in, say, indigenous perspectives on data sovereignty or Global South
concerns about currency volatility.
Gradual Implementation and Dual Systems:  Recognize that old and new will co-exist for some
time (the “hybrid economy”). That suggests strategies like:• 
• 
• 
37
Pilot programs : as mentioned, trial UBI or DAO governance in small settings (a city, or one sector)
and refine before scaling.
Opt-in adoption : allow people to continue with traditional systems or opt into the new system as
they become comfortable. For instance, one could choose whether to receive their benefits via direct
deposit (old way) or via crypto wallet (new way). Over time, as the new proves superior , more will
switch voluntarily.
Safety nets : ironically, we need safety nets for our safety net. If the blockchain system fails for
someone (lost keys, bug, etc.), have an  analogue fallback  – maybe a community organization or
government office that can verify identity and restore access (with appropriate checks). This prevents
tragedies and builds trust that moving to the new system doesn’t mean risking everything. Over
time, the goal is to reduce fallback usage as systems become fail-proof, but it’s crucial in early
phases.
Continual Evolution and Learning:  The social contract built now should not be static. We should
embed learning and update mechanisms . This might involve periodic constitutional conventions
via the Constitutional DAO, where every few years citizens can propose amendments to how the
system works, based on experience (similar to how laws evolve, but here could be faster and more
fluid). Also leverage AI and data to monitor how well outcomes match goals: e.g., track inequality
metrics, civic participation rates, etc. If despite UBI and such, inequality is rising, recalibrate with new
policies (maybe the AI dividend needs to be bigger , or governance more inclusive, etc.). The aim is to
create a  cybernetic governance  in the Stafford Beer sense – constantly self-correcting. In complex
systems terms, maintain feedback loops at multiple levels – daily transactions level, policy level,
meta-constitutional  level  –  to  keep  the  system  in  a  stable,  just  equilibrium  despite  changing
conditions (like new tech, population changes, climate events, etc.).
Cultural Shift and Narrative:  Encourage a cultural narrative that this new system is not a dystopian
Skynet control grid, but rather the next logical extension of humanity’s fight for freedom and dignity.
Emphasize  continuity  with  historical  struggles:  e.g.,  “As  workers  in  the  20th  century  won  the
weekend and pensions, digital citizens in the 21st century are winning data self-ownership and
unconditional income.” This framing can rally support. Work with artists, educators, influencers to
popularize concepts of decentralization and cooperation (like using fiction, games, etc., to let people
“live” the experience virtually and get comfortable). Some movements like  RadicalxChange  have
already started pushing these ideas in academic and activist circles, but a broader public campaign
akin to environmentalism or civil rights in awareness would help. Possibly institute  Blockchain
Civics  courses in schools to train the next generation.
Through these and earlier proposals, we foresee a society where: - Everyone has financial security  (basic
needs met via UBI/dividends) and a voice  (via DAOs, quadratic voting). - Power is not concentrated in a few
hands (because of egalitarian governance and distributed ownership of productive assets). - Transparency
keeps institutions honest, while privacy preserves personal freedom. - The system is resilient to shocks and
can adapt through collective intelligence and feedback.
It’s effectively a new equilibrium : no one lever (like labor strikes) dominates, but a network of incentives
and rules keeps things balanced. Elites cannot easily capture everything because mechanisms like quadratic
funding, SBT-based governance, and commons taxation constantly redistribute both power and wealth. The•

civic order would align more with merit, contribution, and need, and less with arbitrary privilege or brute
force of capital.
In closing: This is a grand vision, undoubtedly challenging. But as history shows, when one paradigm (labor-
based industrial society) reaches its limits, societies undergo great transformations  (to quote Polanyi) and
construct new institutions to safeguard human well-being. Blockchain and cryptographic tech, combined
with enlightened governance design, give us the toolkit to do so in our era. It falls on us – policymakers,
technologists, citizens alike – to seize this opportunity  and ensure that the coming post-labor world is not a
dystopia of inequality and alienation, but a liberated society where  technology serves the public good,
and civic life thrives even without traditional work .
Conclusion
Humanity stands at a crossroads as profound as the Industrial Revolution. Just as the rise of factories
prompted the invention of labor rights to rebalance power , the rise of AI and automation forces us to
reinvent our civic foundations. This report has explored how blockchain and cryptographic technologies
– far from being mere financial novelties – can form the backbone of a new social contract in a world
where human labor is no longer the key engine of economy . Through a macro-systems analysis, we
examined  the  destabilization  caused  by  the  loss  of  labor’s  bargaining  power  and  outlined  how
decentralized,  code-based  institutions  might  restore  equilibrium  by  distributing  power ,  wealth,  and
information in novel ways.
History and theory remind us  that power is never static; it flows into whatever structures we build. In the
industrial age, labor rights and democratic institutions were the structures that kept capitalist power in
check. In the 21st century, we must build new structures – digital, decentralized, yet guided by human-
centric design – to ensure that the immense wealth and capability generated by AI and robotics are
shared broadly rather than captured by a tiny elite . Blockchain, with its transparency, incorruptible
execution, and peer-to-peer ethos, offers tools to encode fairness and accountability at the protocol level.
But technology alone is not a panacea; indeed, we identified significant risks – from plutocratic token
distributions to privacy perils and regulatory hurdles. The journey to a just post-labor society will require
careful  blending  of  technological  innovation  with  social  innovation :  new  laws,  new  norms,  and
continuous civic engagement to steer these systems.
The case studies of Ethereum, Gitcoin, Worldcoin, and Sovrin illustrate both the potential and the pitfalls.
We saw glimpses of a future where: global public goods are funded by the people for the people ; each person
can prove their uniqueness and claim an equal stake in the digital economy ; and individuals control their identity
and data, immune to corporate or state domination . At the same time, we confronted sobering lessons – that
without deliberate design, inequalities can reassert themselves in the new medium  (be it token whales
or biometric misuse). Our evaluation of limitations underscored that the values which labor movements
fought for – equality, security, dignity – must be intentionally re-engineered into the algorithms and
governance of blockchain systems , or else we risk replicating the old injustices in new forms.
We put forward a comprehensive set of proposals: from  quadratic voting and soulbound reputation
tokens  that democratize governance; to  blockchain-based UBI and AI dividends  that ensure everyone
benefits from automation; to self-sovereign identities and zero-knowledge proofs  that protect personal
freedom in an age of radical transparency. We suggested how existing institutions – governments, legal
systems, educational bodies – can pivot and collaborate in this transformation, providing oversight and
39
support  to  purely  code-driven  processes.  Importantly,  we  stressed  inclusion  and  education :  a  social
contract is only legitimate if it is understood and shaped by those whom it governs. The new systems must
be accessible to all, not only to technologists, echoing the ethos that “nothing about us without us” – the
rallying cry of democratic and labor movements through history.
What emerges is a vision of a society where public agency is not tied to one’s employment status but is
a birthright of each person . In this envisioned world: - A global basic income  provides material security,
administered  transparently  by  code  and  insulated  from  political  whims.  -  Decentralized  autonomous
organizations  give communities direct say in managing resources and solving collective problems, fulfilling
the promise of participatory democracy on a scale never before feasible. - Data and AI are harnessed as
commons , with their benefits broadly distributed and their governance open and accountable. - People are
free to pursue education, creativity, care work, or leisure without fear of destitution – the old dream of
“automation  liberating  us”  is  realized  not  through  corporate  benevolence,  but  through  enforceable,
egalitarian protocols instituted by society itself.
Of course, this report is but a starting point. Many questions remain: How do we transition from here to
there without social upheaval? How to coordinate globally, given different cultures and governments? And
how to guard against new concentrations of power that we cannot yet foresee? These will require ongoing
research, experimentation, and dialogue. The solutions will likely be iterative – we will learn by doing, as we
did when first implementing labor laws and social security a century ago.
One  thing  is  certain:  standing  still  is  not  an  option .  If  we  do  nothing,  allowing  AI  and  blockchain
technologies to develop within the old paradigm, we risk a future of extreme inequality – a “rentism” or
“exterminism” scenario where the many are disenfranchised. But if we act with foresight and principle, we
can usher in an era that future historians might call the Age of Digital Commons  or Civic Web3  – a time
when society reinvented its core arrangements to ensure human agency and solidarity survived the end of
labor as we knew it.
In closing, the challenge of replacing labor rights is daunting, but as we have argued, blockchain and
cryptographic tech give us powerful new leverage. Where once workers brandished the strike and the
ballot, tomorrow’s citizens will wield the smart contract and the DAO  – tools of collective action encoded in
our very infrastructure. The task before us is to design these tools and the surrounding institutions such
that  they  uphold  the  timeless  values  of  justice,  freedom,  and  community.  It  is  a  rare  opportunity  to
reimagine what a social contract can be , with the lessons of history in one hand and the technologies of
the future in the other . As we navigate this transition, let us be guided by the foundational insight that has
always driven progress: the legitimacy of any economic system rests on whether it serves the people . By using
blockchain to hard-wire the interests of the many into the operations of our economy and governance, we
have a chance to create a society that is  more transparent, more inclusive, and more resilient  than
anything that came before – truly a new equilibrium for the post-labor age.
