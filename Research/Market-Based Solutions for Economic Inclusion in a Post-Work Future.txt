Market-Based Solutions for Economic Inclusion in a Post-Work Future As automation and AI threaten to eliminate a majority of jobs within the next decade, societies are seeking new economic social contracts that rely less on wage labor and more on broad property ownership and dividend income . Rather than government welfare or universal basic income (UBI), these approaches use market mechanisms to “securitize and distribute” wealth from productive assets (AI, data centers, robotics, land, infrastructure, platforms, etc.) to the public. Below is a global menu of participatory, private-property-based solutions – organized by geography and by type of solution – that enable inclusive prosperity through ownership and dividends rather than wages. United States: Toward a “Property-Owning Democracy” In the U.S., a historically market-driven economy, emerging models focus on widening capital ownership through funds, trusts, cooperatives, and employee equity. These efforts aim to create a “ property-owning democracy ” where returns to capital are shared broadly, counteracting the decline of labor income . Citizen Capital Funds and Wealth Dividends State Investment Funds (Public Wealth Funds): The prime example is the Alaska Permanent Fund , funded by oil revenues and invested globally. Since the 1980s it has paid every Alaskan an annual dividend (roughly \$1,000–\$3,000) from fund earnings . This model has proven popular and made Alaska the least unequal U.S. state by sharing resource wealth broadly . Inspired by Alaska’s success, policy thinkers have proposed a national Social Wealth Fund issuing every American a share and paying a universal basic dividend from investment returns . Under one plan, the U.S. government would build a diversified fund of stocks, real estate, and other assets; citizens couldn’t sell their allotted shares but would earn annual income from the fund’s profits . Such citizen wealth funds turn capital gains into a source of popular income, tackling extreme wealth concentration by expanding asset ownership . For instance, Matt Bruenig’s proposal would gradually socialize a portion of national wealth and pay dividends to all, similar to how James Meade envisioned a community owning 50% of national assets and distributing the returns as a social dividend . Data Dividends: With tech companies amassing wealth from user data, California’s governor floated the idea of a “ Data Dividend ” requiring Big Tech firms to compensate residents for use of their personal data . This concept, still in exploration, treats data as a capital asset and would align incentives by giving individuals a property stake in the data economy rather than relying on taxes. While not yet realized, it reflects growing interest in monetizing digital assets for citizens. Municipal Equity Trusts and Community Funds Urban Wealth Funds: At the local level, cities and counties are exploring urban wealth funds – publicly owned holding companies that manage municipal assets (real estate, utilities, transit12 • 3 3 4 4 4 25 • 6 • 1 systems) to generate revenue for residents or community investment . For example, Hong Kong’s Mass Transit Railway (MTR) is majority city-owned and pays substantial dividends to the city, which are reinvested in public transport and service improvements . This model leverages city- owned land and infrastructure by operating it like a business trust, yielding returns that can fund local services or community dividends without raising taxes . In Copenhagen, a city wealth corporation (CPH City & Port) similarly develops public land and uses the profits to finance infrastructure, aligning municipal and citizen interests in asset growth . Community Investment Trusts: Private-community partnerships are also emerging. In Portland (Oregon), the Community Investment Trust (CIT) allows low-income residents to buy shares ( \ $10–\$100/month) in a neighborhood commercial property, collectively owning and benefiting from local development . Investors earn annual dividends from tenant rents and build equity as the property value rises . By 2019, over 160 families in East Portland received average annual dividends of 9.3% and saw their share price appreciate from \$10 to \$15.86 . Not only has this boosted residents’ net worth, it also increased civic engagement and “buy-in” in the neighborhood’s growth . The CIT model – a loss-protected, community-run REIT – is now being replicated in dozens of U.S. cities to help people “buy back the block” and share in urban prosperity . Public-Private Development Shares: Some localities have experimented with giving residents direct stakes in development projects. For instance, communities negotiating with developers or mines may take an equity stake in projects instead of (or in addition to) tax payments. While more common abroad, a few U.S. examples exist (e.g. Native American tribes often hold shares in casinos or resource companies and pay per-capita dividends to members from the profits). Such community equity ownership ensures that when private ventures thrive on local resources, the residents financially benefit as shareholders, not just as employees or passive bystanders. Dividend-Yielding Cooperatives and Mutual Enterprises Financial Cooperatives: The U.S. hosts a robust network of credit unions and mutual financial institutions owned by their depositors. These member-owners receive better rates and periodic dividend payouts as a share of profits, aligning banking with community wealth-building. For example, over 130 million Americans belong to credit unions, which return earnings to members via reduced loan rates or bonus dividends each year . Similarly, mutual insurance companies (owned by policyholders) may pay out annual patronage dividends. These models turn customers into stakeholders who share in enterprise surplus. Consumer Cooperatives: Iconic consumer co-ops like REI (Recreational Equipment Inc.) operate on a membership-dividend model – members pay a small fee and each year receive ~10% back on purchases as a “patronage dividend” if the co-op is profitable. Food cooperatives, retail co-ops, and utilities co-ops (e.g. rural electric cooperatives) across the U.S. follow a similar ethos, distributing net earnings to their member-owners. While these payouts are modest supplements, they exemplify inclusive capitalism at work in everyday sectors (retail, groceries, energy), anchored in private ownership by the community served. Producer and Worker Cooperatives: Many American farmers and small businesses join producer co-ops (for marketing, supply purchasing, etc.) that return profits to members. Additionally, there is a growing movement of worker cooperatives where employees collectively own the business and share its profits. Although still niche in the U.S., successful examples (e.g. cooperative bakeries, cleaning services, and manufacturing firms) demonstrate that even in a high-tech economy, labor can be organized as owners . Profits that would accrue to shareholders instead go to the workers as dividends or bonuses, providing income beyond wages and building worker wealth over time.78 9 8 9 • 1011 1213 13 1314 1015 • • • • 2 Employee Ownership and Equity-Linked Work Structures Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs): The U.S. has over 6,000 ESOP companies in which workers own significant stakes in their employer . These plans cover around 14 million American employees who collectively hold over \$1.4 trillion in assets . Via ESOPs, companies contribute stock to a trust for employees (often as a retirement plan), effectively making employees into shareholders . Mature ESOPs like Publix Supermarkets (100% employee-owned) or WinCo Foods have turned thousands of retail workers into millionaires upon retirement through stock growth. Employee-owners receive annual share allocations and cash dividends in some cases, aligning their incentive with the company’s success. Research shows ESOP companies often outperform and workers enjoy better job retention and wealth accumulation. This broad-based ownership is market- driven and incentive-aligned – when automation boosts productivity, the gains flow partially to employees via equity, not exclusively to external investors. Profit-Sharing and Equity Compensation: Even outside formal ESOPs, many firms grant stock options, restricted shares, or profit-sharing bonuses to employees. In Silicon Valley, for example, it’s routine for engineers to receive stock options – this created a new class of worker-capitalists who benefit from tech company valuations. Some startups experiment with employee profit-sharing agreements where a portion of future profits or equity is contractually shared with early employees. Such equity-linked employment ensures that as AI and technology amplify a company’s profits with fewer workers, those workers still receive a dividend-like income stream. On a policy level, there have been proposals to expand employee equity: for instance, the UK Labour Party’s 2019 Inclusive Ownership Fund idea was noted in U.S. discussions, where large companies would be required to contribute a small percentage of shares annually into a fund for their employees, yielding yearly dividend payouts . Public-Private Shareholding Models Public Asset Corporations: The U.S. has few nationalized companies, but one can imagine public- private hybrids that share ownership between government, private investors, and citizens. One existing model is the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) – a federally owned power corporation – which doesn’t pay dividends to individuals but reinvests in low-cost power and development (indirect broad benefit). A more radical approach would let citizens directly hold shares of public enterprises or infrastructure projects , earning dividends. Though not yet common in the U.S., this concept is akin to public-private partnerships where local citizens can buy bonds or shares in toll roads, solar farms, or broadband networks that serve them. The Austin Energy Community Solar program, for example, enables citizens to invest in solar panels on the city grid and receive credits (a form of dividend) on their bills . This blurs the line between customer and owner , fostering participatory economics. “Inclusive Capitalism” Funds: On a broader scale, prominent American financiers and economists have called for mechanisms to spread capital ownership . Ideas include a “universal basic capital” endowment for every citizen , or requiring companies that heavily leveraged public R&D (like AI firms) to issue equity to a national citizen fund as payback . These shares would collectively make the public a minority owner in high-growth tech enterprises, and dividends or gains could fund social dividends or reinvestment in education. While these models need enabling policy, they reflect a shift toward viewing capital ownership as a right of citizenship , complementing or replacing labor income in the automated future . (Table 1 below highlights U.S. examples of inclusive ownership structures and their impact.)• 16 16 • 17 • 1819 • 20 21 2223 3 Model (U.S.) Description Example & Impact State Wealth FundPublic investment fund paying citizen dividendsAlaska Permanent Fund – invests oil revenue; pays \ $1K–\$3K per resident yearly, making Alaska most equal state .

Data Dividend ProposalUsers paid for data collected by companiesCalifornia Data Dividend – exploring requiring Big Tech to share a portion of data-driven profits with state residents . Europe: Broadening Ownership in Mature Economies Across Europe, where social welfare states coexist with market economies, the trend is toward collective capital formation and policies that spread corporate ownership. The EU has strong cooperative traditions and is experimenting with new inclusive ownership funds. Citizen and Social Wealth Funds Sovereign Wealth and Public Trusts: Several European countries manage sovereign wealth funds (e.g. Norway’s oil fund, Ireland’s sovereign fund), but these typically reinvest in public services rather than pay out dividends to individuals. However , the principle of capturing common wealth is established. In the UK, think tanks and politicians have advocated a Citizens’ Wealth Fund to collectively own assets and distribute returns. A proposed UK fund could be built from progressive wealth taxes, transfers of public assets, and even mandated share issuances from corporations . One visionary idea: require large UK companies to issue new shares (e.g. 0.5% of their value annually) into a public fund until the fund owns, say, 10% of the national corporate equity . This gradual socialization (inspired by Sweden’s 1980s wage-earner funds) would create a sizable portfolio paying out a universal citizen dividend from dividends and capital gains . Although not yet realized, it influenced Labour’s Inclusive Ownership Fund plan, which aimed to transfer 1% of big firms’ stock per year to worker funds (up to 10%) – yielding dividends for employees (capped, with surplus to social programs) . In France, a similar concept of a “ fonds citoyen ” has been discussed to invest wealth on behalf of all citizens. These social wealth funds align with Nobel laureate James Meade’s vision of democratizing capital to counter automation’s skewed gains . National Share Distributions: Some European transitions have featured one-time mass distributions of capital. In the 1990s, post-communist countries like Czechia undertook voucher privatizations , giving every citizen vouchers to acquire shares in former state companies (creating investment funds and a shareholder class overnight). While execution had flaws (many sold shares cheaply), it was a bold attempt to instantly broaden ownership. Similarly, Germany in reunification3 13 6 • 24 25 25 25 17 26 2 • 4 offered East German citizens shares in state enterprises or investment funds. These historical cases show the feasibility of turning public assets into citizen-owned equity . Today, a peaceful analog might be to distribute a portion of shares whenever a state-owned enterprise is privatized or a tech IPO occurs – ensuring the public gets a direct stake in new wealth. Municipal and Regional Equity Initiatives Community and Municipal Ownership: Europe has a rich tradition of municipal enterprises (e.g. city-owned utilities, transit, housing companies). Increasingly, these are run on commercial lines, and some cities have explored sharing profits with residents. For example, Vienna’s city housing company reinvests rental profits into affordable housing expansion, effectively socializing the returns to benefit tenants (though not paid out as cash). In Norway , many municipalities own local power companies and pay yearly “power grants” or dividends to local households or reduced utility bills. Urban wealth funds similar to those in the U.S. are promoted by urban finance experts in Europe as well – pooling city real estate and infrastructure into professionally managed funds to generate revenue for the community . Copenhagen did this by consolidating its port and land assets, using the capital appreciation to fund a metro line (citizens gained a new service without new taxes – an indirect dividend in kind). There is potential for European cities to go further and pay urban dividends : for instance, if a city fund earns a surplus, a portion could be paid per resident or reinvested in local per capita benefits. Community Shares and Energy Co-ops: At a grassroots level, the UK and other countries have community share schemes, where residents collectively invest in local businesses or renewables. Thousands of Britons have bought community shares in projects like village pubs, wind farms, or local food markets, earning modest annual returns and keeping profits local. In Denmark and Germany , community wind and solar cooperatives are common – local citizens finance a wind turbine and then receive dividend income from selling the power . These arrangements propertize infrastructure in small scale: instead of a utility or government owning a wind farm, a cooperative of townsfolk does, blending private ownership with public participation. Cooperatives and Mutual Enterprises Worker Cooperatives: Europe is home to some of the world’s largest and most successful worker- owned enterprises. The Mondragon Corporation in Spain’s Basque Country is a federation of over 90 worker cooperatives (industrial, retail, financial) employing 80,000 people. Workers are co- owners who share profits equitably and vote on major decisions. Mondragon members receive annual profit distributions (dividends) based on the coop’s performance, part in cash and part retained as internal capital . This model has shown resilience and inclusive growth; even as technology changes work, Mondragon’s employee-owners have a stake in the robots and factories displacing labor . Italy’s Emilia-Romagna region likewise boasts a dense network of co-ops (including many social co-ops delivering care services) that reinvest profits in jobs and community needs, while still returning dividends to their member-owners. Cooperative banks in Europe (e.g. Rabobank in NL, Crédit Agricole in FR) and mutual insurers are major players that reward their member-customers. The cooperative sector thus provides a collective ownership framework with real profit-sharing for tens of millions of Europeans, from farmers and artisans to retail shoppers. Employee Ownership and Codetermination: Beyond pure co-ops, many European corporations incorporate employee ownership or profit-sharing. France has legally mandated profit-sharing (participation) for medium/large firms since 1967 – employees receive a share of profits (often placed in company investment funds for a period) which builds their asset stake. France also offers• 78 • • 27 • 5 tax advantages for employee share purchase plans , resulting in about 3.5 million employee shareholders in listed companies. In Germany , the codetermination system gives workers board representation, and some companies (like Siemens, Bosch) have longstanding employee profit- sharing or foundation ownership structures. Bosch, for example, is majority-owned by a charitable foundation and employees, ensuring profits benefit society and staff rather than just external shareholders. Employee stock ownership in the UK, France, and Scandinavia is encouraged by policy (via share-save schemes, matches, etc.), aiming to align workers with capital . The EU even declared promotion of employee financial participation as a goal in the early 2000s, recognizing it as a tool for inclusion. Mutuals and Social Enterprises: Europe’s strong social economy includes mutual insurers (e.g. UK’s Royal London, Germany’s health insurance funds) that rebate surplus to members, as well as social enterprises that cap dividends to balance profit with mission. These contribute to an ownership culture where stakeholders, not just investors, share rewards. Public-Private and Hybrid Models Wage-Earner Funds (Sweden): A notable historical experiment was Sweden’s “Meidner Plan” in the 1980s. It required large companies to issue new shares annually to union-controlled wage-earner funds , aiming to gradually transfer a portion of ownership to workers collectively . Over time, workers’ funds would receive dividends from these shares and gain voting power . The funds did operate for several years and accumulated significant assets before political pushback ended the scheme in the 1990s. While controversial, the Meidner Plan was a pioneering market-based socialization mechanism – it did not tax profits but simply had firms dilute equity to give workers a stake . Its legacy influences today’s proposals for inclusive ownership funds in the UK and elsewhere as a way to blend public and private shareholding . State-Community Joint Ownership: In some cases, European governments have promoted joint ownership of enterprises. For example, Poland in the 2010s experimented with employee-consumer stock ownership during privatizations (allocating some shares to workers and some to citizen investors at discounts). Austria has a system of “Mitarbeiterbeteiligungsstiftung” (employee participation foundations) for tax-advantaged employee share ownership, often with state encouragement. There are also instances of municipal-public partnerships : e.g. in Switzerland, many utilities are owned 51% by the city and 49% by private investors/citizens, ensuring profits are shared between public budgets and private shareholders. Such models harness capital markets for public good, giving citizens an opportunity to invest in what were public monopolies and enjoy dividend income.

Community- Owned EnergyLocal residents collectively own renewable energy installations and earn incomeDenmark’s Wind Cooperatives – thousands of Danes share ownership of wind turbines, receiving dividend income from electricity sales. Asia: Asset-Based Welfare and Collective Ownership Asia’s diverse economies – from advanced Japan to developing India – are experimenting with inclusive ownership, often building on community traditions or state-led initiatives. Notably, collective property rights reforms in countries like China are unlocking new dividend streams for citizens. Collective Asset Reforms in China Village Shareholding Cooperatives: In China, rural land and enterprises have traditionally been collectively owned by villages. Recent reforms (since 2016) have clarified these property rights and converted collective assets into village shareholding cooperatives , distributing shares to villagers . Each member of the village collective is allocated shares representing farmland, local businesses, or rental properties; they then receive dividends based on the collective’s earnings . This effectively turns villagers into shareholders of local development. In practice, many peri-urban villages that leased out land for factories or apartments now pay residents an annual dividend from the lease income. For example, in Haidian District of Beijing , rural villagers became shareholders in lucrative collective ventures and began receiving substantial dividends, allowing some to stop outside work . In southern China (Shenzhen, Guangzhou), urbanized villages have “economic share cooperatives” where each original villager might get a yearly payout from property rentals that can exceed a typical wage. These dividends are conditional (tied to membership and profits) , not a guaranteed basic income, but they have significantly raised rural incomes and given villagers a tangible stake in growth . Notably, some collectives are issuing new types of shares (for example, shares for long-term migrant workers or contributed labor) to broaden inclusion beyond lineage villagers . China’s approach shows how formalizing communal property and securitizing it into shares can empower millions with capital income – essentially a grassroot private-sector solution supported by government framework. State Enterprise Reforms: While China hasn’t implemented a national dividend fund, it has experimented at the margins. In the 2000s, there were trials of giving citizens shares in state companies during restructuring. For instance, some provinces discussed issuing “people’s shares” of profitable state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to residents or all Chinese. In practice, rather than direct distribution, China more often uses state profits for public goods. However , Hong Kong (a special region) once issued a “ HKSAR Share ” to each resident during a 2011 demutualization of a tracking stock, which people could redeem for cash – a one-time capital distribution. Such examples27 • 2829 29 30 2930 31 • 7 are rare, but as China automates, proposals for a sovereign tech fund or public equity transfers to the National Social Security Fund (which could reduce future taxes or increase pensions) are debated. Worker Cooperatives: China also has a growing cooperative movement under the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives (historically state-guided). Farmer cooperatives and share cooperatives have formed in agriculture and handicrafts; members share profits though many are quasi-public. In the private sector , tech giants like Alibaba have used broad-based stock options to enrich employees, albeit not to redistribute beyond employees. Asset-Based Social Development (East Asia) Singapore’s Ownership Society: Singapore pioneered “ asset-based welfare ,” emphasizing home ownership and savings over wage subsidies. Through the Central Provident Fund (CPF) , citizens mandatorily save a chunk of their salary into personal accounts that the government invests (often in bonds and equities). CPF members earn annual interest (2.5–5%) – effectively a bond-like dividend – and can use their accumulating capital for housing, healthcare, or retirement income. This model forces inclusive savings : nearly all working Singaporeans thus own significant assets by retirement (often including their HDB public housing flat, acquired via CPF). While CPF returns are administratively set, not market-driven, Singapore’s government investment arms (like Temasek and GIC) generate high returns on national savings, indirectly benefiting citizens through strong fiscal health and occasional bonus “growth dividends” (cash transfers during surplus years). The Public Housing program itself is a wealth equalizer – citizens buy flats subsidized and later can sell at market value, capturing appreciation (a form of capital gain distribution). By turning citizens into homeowners and account-holders of a national fund, Singapore reduced reliance on labor income for lifetime security. Malaysia’s Equity Distribution: Malaysia, under its New Economic Policy (NEP) after 1970, set targets to increase Bumiputra (majority Malay) ownership of corporate equity. This included creating trust agencies that held shares on behalf of Malays and launching unit trusts (ASN, ASB) where ordinary people could invest in a government-managed stock/bond fund with guaranteed minimum dividends. Millions of Malaysians bought into these funds, receiving annual dividends typically around 6–8%. The NEP also encouraged companies to allocate shares to employee and community trusts. While state-driven, these measures used market instruments (trust funds, share allocations) to broaden property ownership among historically excluded groups . Neighboring countries like Indonesia and Thailand have had smaller programs for employee share ownership in privatizations, but Malaysia’s scale (billions in assets in trust funds) stands out. Japan and South Korea: These advanced economies have high rates of personal savings and equity investment, but less in terms of novel inclusion schemes. Japan’s culture of lifetime employment meant less focus on employee shares (though many companies offer small stock purchase plans to staff). Instead, households accumulated wealth through savings and real estate. However , both Japan and Korea have extensive cooperative sectors (agricultural co-ops, fisheries co-ops, credit unions) that support rural incomes via profit-sharing. Korea’s chaebols have not distributed equity to citizens, but there is discussion about startup equity crowdfunding and giving workers shares in chaebol spinoffs. Notably, Mongolia made a bold attempt: its government in 2012 allocated 536 shares of a big coal mining company (Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi) to every Mongolian citizen . Citizens were initially restricted from selling, to encourage holding for dividends. The company is now profitable, and Mongolia is revisiting this promise by delivering dividends or buy-backs for those shares . This “people’s IPO” approach, if successful, literally gives each citizen a stake in natural resource wealth – an alternative to the state just spending the mining revenue. Mongolia• • • 3233 • 34 3536 8 had also paid out some cash from a Human Development Fund (resource revenue) earlier , but the share distribution aimed to instill an ownership mindset. Cooperatives, Mutuals, and Microfinance in Asia Cooperative Giants: India and other South Asian countries boast huge cooperative enterprises. The Amul dairy cooperative in India, owned by 3.6 million farmers, processes milk and returns profits to its farmer-members, dramatically raising their incomes. Indian sugar mills and cotton mills are often co-ops as well. In Japan, nearly one in three families is a member of the Japan Consumer Co- operative Union (for retail goods), and agricultural co-ops (JA Group) handle everything from credit to marketing, distributing any surpluses back to farmer members. These co-ops may not pay high dividends (many prioritize services and stable prices), but they do return value to those traditionally at the bottom of the value chain, effectively monetizing collective scale for members’ benefit . Microfinance Ownership: A notable example of inclusive finance is Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Uniquely, Grameen’s borrowers (mostly poor rural women) own 94% of the bank’s equity . As shareholder-borrowers, they elect the board and receive annual dividends from Grameen’s profits . Over decades, Grameen’s millions of women members have earned dividends (e.g. 100% dividend in 2006, 30% in 2008–2010) on their small share purchases . This model turns lending on its head – the “clients” are also the owners, so when the bank succeeds, the poorest share in the gains. It demonstrates that even for populations with very low incomes , collective ownership can provide a supplementary income stream and asset accumulation (via share value) . The Grameen example has inspired other community-owned microfinance and cooperative banks across Asia and Africa. In India, Self-Help Groups link to banks and sometimes federate into cooperatives that distribute profits to village women. These grassroots ownership structures give the poor a direct stake in financial capital. Employee Share Schemes: Many Asian corporations, especially in tech, have emulated Silicon Valley in offering stock options to employees – creating thousands of middle-class asset holders. In China’s tech IPOs (Alibaba, Tencent), not only employees but sometimes users or merchants were offered shares at IPO (e.g. Alibaba’s customers could buy shares in its Ant Group affiliate). In South Korea , chaebol firms have often given workers shares at concessional rates as part of labor settlements. And in Pakistan and Sri Lanka , when state enterprises privatized, a portion of shares was reserved for employees or sold in lots affordable to small investors, aiming to foster a shareholder culture. While these instances are case-by-case, they reflect a broader trend: using equity stakes to reward or empower individuals beyond traditional salaries. Public-Private Shareholding Innovations Middle East – IPOs for Citizens: Several Gulf countries are converting state assets into citizen- owned stakes. For example, Saudi Arabia’s 2019 Saudi Aramco IPO reserved a large portion of shares for Saudi citizens and even offered bonus shares as incentives for long-term holding . Over 5 million Saudi citizens became shareholders of Aramco, and the company’s hefty dividends (Aramco is one of the world’s highest dividend payers) now flow partially into citizens’ hands instead of only the state treasury. This was a deliberate effort to share the kingdom’s oil wealth more directly with the people via the market. Similarly, Dubai and Abu Dhabi have floated minority stakes in state utilities (water , energy companies) on local stock markets, encouraging residents to invest. By treating citizens as investors , Gulf states hope to distribute wealth and also instill loyalty. Iran’s government, amid 2000s privatization, launched “ Justice Shares ” – essentially allocating shares of state firms to low-income households at steep discounts (to be paid off via future dividends). Tens of37 • • 3839 4041 42 4344 • • 45 9 millions received these shares, which paid periodic dividends, though political interference complicated the program. Nonetheless, it shows a path where privatization and social equity goals coincide by making every citizen a capitalist-participant in formerly state-run wealth. Public-Private Partnerships with Community Stake: In developing Asia, big projects often include a community share component. For instance, mining companies in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia have given local landowner associations equity stakes (e.g. Freeport’s Grasberg mine set aside ~10% for a local trust) to ensure local people benefit from dividends. In India , some states negotiating with private power producers have taken a small equity for the local government or affected villagers, to be held in a trust for community development (dividend income used for schools, etc.). While not widespread, these attempts foreshadow a model where any private exploitation of community resources (land, minerals, even data) is accompanied by community shareholding . Over time, this could mean a village whose land is used for , say, a solar farm, would automatically receive shares in the project company – yielding dividend income that could be distributed among residents or reinvested for common goods. Global South: Grassroots Capitalism and Shared Ownership In developing countries of Africa and Latin America, inequality and job scarcity motivate creative schemes for inclusive ownership. Many of these build on cooperative economics, natural resource revenues, and local collective institutions. Natural Resource Dividends and Trusts Resource Revenue Trusts: Countries rich in oil, gas, or minerals have begun setting up sovereign wealth funds and some are exploring citizen dividends. For example, Botswana invests its diamond profits into a national fund that has fueled education and infrastructure (indirect broad gains), though without direct citizen payouts. Nigeria’s oil-rich Delta states have experimented with community development foundations funded by oil companies’ profits to benefit local youth (scholarships, etc.), a step toward localized dividends . A more direct approach is making communities shareholders in mining projects : In Zimbabwe , the government in 2011 mandated foreign mining companies to cede at least 10% ownership to Community Share Ownership Trusts (CSOTs) for local residents . By 2016, about 50 CSOTs had been created, each holding equity in mines and intended to use dividends for local development (schools, clinics, etc.) . For instance, the platinum giant Zimplats gave a 10% share (worth $10 million) to the Mhondoro-Ngezi community trust, which was used to fund projects and is expected to generate ongoing dividend income . While implementation ran into challenges, Zimbabwe’s policy recognized that local people are the rightful co-owners of natural wealth and should receive an ongoing share of profits, not one-time compensation. South Africa’s post-apartheid Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) programs similarly required mining companies to include community and employee shareholdings. The Royal Bafokeng Nation in South Africa is a famous case: this community used legal rights over platinum- rich land to obtain royalties and now directly owns shares in Impala Platinum. Through their Royal Bafokeng Holdings (a community company), they invest mining dividends into public services for the tribe. Such models turn resource extraction into community shareholders’ enterprises , aligning company success with local prosperity. Land and Agriculture Trusts: In agrarian economies, land is a key asset. Some countries have set up land trusts or titling programs to give communities secure tenure and the ability to lease land for income. In Mexico , although ejidos (communal lands) historically couldn’t pay dividends, recent• • 4647 47 4849 • 10 reforms allow leasing ejido land to investors with communities getting a rent share. In Peru , native communities that allow oil or logging on their territories negotiate royalty-like payments per unit extracted – functionally a dividend for community members from natural capital. These are often paid to community funds that then distribute cash or fund local basic incomes. While not as formalized as Alaska’s dividend, these arrangements in the Global South show a principle of direct payback to the grassroots from natural assets . Cooperatives and Community Enterprises African Cooperatives: Cooperatives are a pillar of inclusive growth in Africa. In Kenya , the cooperative movement has over 14 million members (in a nation of ~50 million) and accounts for at least 10% of GDP . Thousands of Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) enable members to save and borrow, then return surplus interest as dividends to the members . Kenyan dairy farmers join co-ops to market milk and receive year-end bonuses from profits; artisanal miners form co-ops to sell gold collectively and share proceeds. Even Uber drivers in Nairobi have formed cooperative-like groups to rent or buy cars, effectively capturing more value from their labor . Similarly, in Ethiopia , millions of small farmers are in agricultural cooperatives that share profits from coffee exports, etc. These co-ops not only bolster incomes but give individuals ownership shares in enterprises far larger than they could individually achieve, distributing market power and earnings democratically. Latin America’s Solidarity Economy: Many Latin American communities have long traditions of solidarity and cooperative enterprises. In Argentina , after the 2001 crisis, workers took over many bankrupt factories and ran them as cooperatives (e.g. the recovered garment factory Brukman, the Zanón ceramics factory). These worker co-ops saved jobs and now any profits are shared among the former employees-turned-owners. Argentina also has coop networks in the urban informal sector (waste pickers’ cooperatives, etc.) where increased revenues are split among members. In Uruguay , the Cooperative Housing Movement (FUCVAM) enables low-income families to collectively own housing projects; members pay into the coop and effectively build equity in the housing, which is owned collectively with limited individual sale rights (maintaining affordability but granting a form of dividend: affordable rent that builds ownership stake). Brazil has large cooperatives like Cooxupé (coffee coop with thousands of small growers sharing export profits) and an active solidarity economy movement including community banks whose profits stay local. While many of these Latin models focus on social outcomes over high dividends, they illustrate participatory ownership delivering concrete economic benefits (patronage refunds, housing equity, community funds for education from coop surplus, etc.). Micro-Enterprises and Franchises: In parts of Africa and South Asia, NGOs and social businesses have created models like micro-franchising where individuals collectively invest in a business network. For instance, a group of women in Uganda might co-own a solar charging kiosk franchise; they split the profits (a dividend-like income) instead of each running a separate precarious business. In Bangladesh , BRAC’s community-owned enterprises (like milk chilling centers owned by dairy farmers) pay out profits to those farmers. These micro-ventures show that even in villages, capital can be pooled and returns shared on a small scale – a principle that could grow with digital platforms linking rural entrepreneurs to markets. Innovative Equity Structures Infrastructure and Platform Ownership: As platform-based and gig work expands in the Global South, there are experiments to “platform cooperativize” these sectors. For example, in India ,• 50 50 • • • 11 drivers in some cities are forming their own ride-hailing apps as cooperatives, so that they collectively own the platform that assigns rides (as opposed to being controlled by Uber). If successful, the profits from ride fees would belong to driver-members, distributed either through better earnings or periodic dividends. In Kenya , where mobile money (M-Pesa) is huge, there have been calls for telecom companies to share part of their profit or ownership with the Kenyan public who underpin the network’s value. Although Safaricom (which runs M-Pesa) hasn’t given direct dividends to users, its 2008 IPO was designed to be very inclusive – over 800,000 Kenyans became shareholders, many of them small farmers and teachers, and have since enjoyed strong dividends and stock growth as Safaricom prospered. This was one of the largest broadenings of share ownership in Africa, creating a culture of ordinary citizens earning passive income from a leading tech company. Similar public share offerings happened for breweries and banks in Kenya and Ghana, seeding a shareholder class where none existed. The key is that inclusive IPOs and share schemes let citizens benefit from high-growth sectors (telecom, finance) not just as consumers but as part-owners. Mobile Investment Platforms: New fintech tools in emerging markets are enabling micro-investing and profit-sharing. In Nigeria and Kenya , platforms like TontineTrust or local crowdsourcing apps allow groups to jointly invest in an asset (e.g. a food processing machine or a rental property) and split the returns. Some governments are leveraging mobile money to democratize access to bonds – Kenya’s M-Akiba bond was sold in \$30 increments via mobile phone to tens of thousands of citizens, paying 10% interest: effectively making a government interest dividend accessible to the poor . This approach doesn’t transfer ownership of productive capital per se (it’s government debt), but it shows appetite for small-scale investment vehicles that include everyone in earning income from capital markets. If extended to equity (e.g. a “national infrastructure REIT” where anyone can buy \$10 shares via mobile and earn dividends from highways or ports), it could vastly widen property ownership. Public-Community Partnerships Community Development Funds: In both Africa and Latin America, public authorities are exploring joint investment with communities. One model is the municipal-commonwealth approach : city or regional governments set up a fund in which they match investments by community members dollar for dollar , then use it to develop local projects and share the returns. For instance, a city in Brazil might create a neighborhood development fund; residents collectively invest a small amount, which the city matches, and the fund builds a marketplace or housing which yields rental income – distributed back to the resident-investors and also used for community services. This aligns public and citizen investors in revitalizing communities, with citizens gaining both a financial return and improved amenities. Conditional Cash to Equity Conversions: A novel idea being trialed in some places (e.g. Colombia on a pilot basis) is to convert conditional cash transfer beneficiaries (welfare recipients) gradually into shareholders of enterprises. Instead of indefinitely paying welfare, the government invests a portion of these funds into an index fund or local business on behalf of the poor family, who then start receiving dividend income after some years, eventually replacing the transfer . While experimental, it represents a creative fusion of social policy and market participation: using public funds to bootstrap private capital income for the poor , so they become self-sustaining capitalists over time rather than aid-dependent.• • • 12 Conclusion: Securitize (Almost) Everything – A New Inclusive Ownership Era Across the world, these examples point toward a future where economic inclusion comes from ownership of assets and the income they generate , not merely from wages. As AI and robotics concentrate productivity in the hands of those who own the algorithms, data, and machines, the imperative is clear: ownership itself must be democratized . Market-based, incentive-aligned mechanisms – from citizen funds investing in AI to employees holding equity in automated firms – can ensure everyone has a stake in the post-work economy’s gains. Key high-growth sectors offer ripe opportunities for inclusion: Artificial Intelligence & Big Tech: By instituting national or global “AI wealth funds” that take equity stakes in AI firms (in recognition of public R&D contributions) and pay out an “AI dividend” to citizens, societies can reclaim part of AI’s immense value . Innovative finance like AI bonds (as proposed in the UK) let citizens invest in the AI ecosystem and earn returns if the sector booms . This ensures broad sharing of AI’s upside, much as index funds spread stock market gains to small investors. Likewise, requiring tech firms to compensate individuals for data or to issue shares to user trusts would turn the data economy into a co-owned commons rather than a one-way extraction . Sam Altman of OpenAI and others have floated these ideas of an “AI dividend for every citizen” , funded by equity in the AI companies and platforms that will dominate future GDP . Robotics & Automation: As factories and warehouses are increasingly run by robots, the answer to “who benefits?” can be everyone, via shares . For instance, displaced workers could be granted stock in the very robot firms that replaced their jobs . Municipal governments could form robotics investment trusts , where public money invests in automation startups and the returns finance dividends or local basic services. If every citizen held even a small portfolio of stocks or bonds tied to automation (through pension funds, sovereign funds, or personal investment accounts), then automation dividends would flow across society. The principle “ if you can’t beat the robots, own the robots ” encapsulates this approach. Platforms & Networks: Every platform – whether social media, gig work, e-commerce, or even utilities – can be reimagined with distributed ownership . This could be through platform cooperatives (users or providers collectively own an Uber alternative, sharing profits), or through equity requirements (e.g. a law that ride-sharing companies must allocate 20% of equity to their drivers as a class, making every driver a shareholder entitled to dividends). High-growth platform businesses often achieve monopoly-like profits; spreading their ownership prevents winner-take-all outcomes. Already, experiments like driver-owned rideshare apps, community-owned broadband networks, and user-owned creative content platforms (where artists get equity in the streaming service) are laying groundwork for participatory platform capitalism . In sum, the strategy is to “securitize and distribute everything ” – transform labor , natural resources, and even social data into capital assets with shares that people and communities can own . This echoes how neoliberal policies once commodified and privatized many areas of life; but here the goal is not concentration, it’s inclusion : expanding markets by expanding capital ownership to all groups . Such an approach is decentralized (relying on myriad private and local actors), incentive-compatible (people gain by participating economically), and has real-world precedents as shown above.• 5122 52 21 45 • 23 • 13 The coming post-work era demands moving beyond the wage-centric model. By embracing market-based inclusion mechanisms – from citizen dividend funds to cooperatives and equity-sharing schemes – societies can ensure broad prosperity even if formal jobs become scarce. These solutions harness capitalism’s own tools (stocks, dividends, ownership rights) to build a more equitable future. The menu of options is rich and growing, inviting adaptation to each country’s context. With bold implementation, a world where only 20% have traditional jobs need not be a world of mass immiseration, but one where the 100% are stakeholders in the wealth generated by machines and algorithms. Through private-property- based participation, everyone can receive a dividend from progress . Sources: The concepts and cases above draw on numerous real-world examples and proposals. Key references include economic analyses of property-owning democracy , policy papers on social wealth funds , reports on inclusive ownership experiments (e.g. Meidner Plan, UK proposals) , as well as case studies of cooperative and employee-owned enterprises across the globe . Empirical outcomes from Alaska’s fund , China’s village dividends , Portland’s community trust , Grameen Bank , Kenya’s cooperatives , and many more have been cited throughout to illustrate these models in action. These examples demonstrate the viability of shifting the economic base from wages to broadly shared capital – a shift crucial for the age of AI.
