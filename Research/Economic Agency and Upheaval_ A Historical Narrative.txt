Economic Agency and Upheaval: A Historical
Narrative
Introduction: Poverty, Powerlessness, and the Will to Revolt
In every era, communities have struggled over who gets to shape economic destiny. From the grain riots of
ancient empires to the street protests of the 21st century, a common thread runs through history: when
people lose their economic agency  – the ability to influence their own economic well-being through secure
labor , property, and democratic rights – their political willpower grows desperate and fierce. As Aristotle
observed over two millennia ago, poverty and perceived injustice can become “the parent of revolution and
crime” . This narrative nonfiction account traces the rise and fall of economic agency across history and
how its decline has often sparked revolution, civil war , regime change, or radical reform. We journey from
the Age of Revolutions at the dawn of modern democracy, through industrial upheavals and world wars, to
the convulsions of the Great Depression, the Oil Shocks of the 1970s, and the turmoil of the Great Recession
and Arab Spring. Along the way, we examine the ideas of great economic thinkers – Karl Marx, Karl Polanyi,
Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman – who sought to explain why the loss of economic freedom so often
ignites political rebellion. We will see that when people are shut out of economic decision-making and left
unable to secure a decent life, they frequently channel their frustrations into political action. Sometimes this
feedback loop yields gradual reform; other times it explodes into the barricades, guillotines, or militant
movements that alter the course of nations. By weaving together vivid historical examples with economic
data  on  wages,  prices,  and  poverty,  this  account  illuminates  the  intimate  dance  between  economic
disempowerment  and  political  mobilization .  The  result  is  a  sweeping  narrative  –  accessible  yet
intellectually  rigorous  –  that  demonstrates  how  the  erosion  of  economic  agency  has  again  and  again
provoked the masses to make history.
Theoretical Framework: Economic Agency and the Seeds of Revolt
Economic agency  can be defined as an individual’s capacity to shape their own economic destiny – a power
grounded in such rights as the ability to work freely (labor rights), to own and use property (property
rights), and to participate in governance (democratic rights). When these rights are robust, people can
improve their lot in life, negotiate fair wages, start businesses, or influence policies that affect them. When
these rights are denied or eroded, whole classes of people may feel locked into poverty or exploitation with
no peaceful remedy. This condition, history shows, is politically combustible.
The  link  between  economic  conditions  and  political  action  has  been  noted  by  thinkers  for  centuries.
Aristotle’s  maxim  about  poverty  causing  revolution  hints  at  an  intuitive  truth:  extreme  inequality  or
hardship  breeds  unrest .  Enlightenment  philosophers  like  John  Locke  argued  that  life,  liberty  and
property  were natural rights – ideas that would kindle the American and French revolutions. In the 19th
century, Karl Marx  placed economic agency at the heart of his theory of history. In The Communist Manifesto
(1848), Marx and Engels famously declared that “the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of
class struggles,” wherein oppressor and oppressed classes inevitably collide . Marx observed how the
capitalist system had stripped workers (the proletariat) of property and control, reducing them to “wage-1
1
2

slaves” with little say over their fate. This economic disenfranchisement, he argued, would produce class
consciousness  and  an  inevitable  revolutionary  “victory  of  the  proletariat”  that  would  overthrow  the
bourgeoisie and end class society . In Marx’s vision, declining economic agency – workers having
“nothing to lose but their chains” – was the precondition for an uprising to reclaim power .
Not all thinkers agreed revolution was inevitable, but many acknowledged a tight link between economic
freedom  and  political  order .  The  economic  historian  Karl  Polanyi  described  a  “double  movement”  in
capitalist  societies:  first,  elites  push  laissez-faire  market  policies  that  often  disempower  workers  and
communities;  next,  a  popular  countermovement  arises  to  demand  social  protections  and  rein  in  the
market’s excesses . In Polanyi’s analysis of the 19th and early 20th centuries, unfettered markets
commodified labor and land, tearing people from traditional livelihoods and exposing them to brutal boom-
bust cycles . Society responded with labor laws, welfare provisions, and other reforms to re-embed  the
economy in social needs . These reforms – from factory safety rules to voting rights – were essentially
concessions to restore a measure of economic agency and stave off unrest. Polanyi thus saw the feedback
loop: economic dislocation spurs social resistance , which can force political change.
Meanwhile, liberal economists like Friedrich Hayek  and Milton Friedman  stressed the inverse relationship:
political  freedom  depends  on  economic  freedom.  Hayek,  in  The  Road  to  Serfdom  (1944),  warned  that
government control of economic decisions – such as centralized planning or excessive regulation – would
inevitably lead to tyranny . If individuals cannot make free economic choices, Hayek argued, a coercive
authority must be micromanaging society, extinguishing liberty. He cautioned that even well-intentioned
socialist  policies  could  put  nations  on  a  “road  to  serfdom,”  where  loss  of  economic  agency  under  an
omnipotent state ends in totalitarian rule . Friedman similarly asserted that “economic freedom is also
an  indispensable  means  toward  the  achievement  of  political  freedom” .  In  Friedman’s  historical
analysis, capitalism has been a necessary condition for political liberty , providing a check on state power
.  When  people  are  free  to  choose  their  work,  spend  their  income,  and  own  property,  they  have
independent power bases that make it harder for governments to tyrannize them . Conversely, when
states or aristocracies monopolize economic life, citizens become vulnerable subjects, and any political
rights are hollow. Even these free-market advocates acknowledged a complex two-way relationship:  the
link  between  political  and  economic  freedom  is  “by  no  means  unilateral” .  Nineteenth-century
reformers like Bentham believed giving the masses political rights would enable them to remove economic
shackles , whereas later thinkers like Hayek believed protecting economic freedom was essential to
maintaining political rights . In practice, both directions operate in a feedback loop.
Modern social science has attempted to formalize why declining economic agency so often explodes into
protest or rebellion. One influential idea is the theory of relative deprivation  – revolutions tend to erupt
not when conditions are static at a low level, but when a period of rising prosperity and expectations is
followed by a sharp downturn or the realization of persistent inequality. As one analysis noted, “revolutions
rarely happen in stagnant, destitute countries.” Instead, they occur in societies that  enjoyed growth or
rising expectations  without political reform, or those that suffer a sudden economic crisis after a boom
. In such cases, people feel they are being deprived of a better life that seemed within reach, which fuels
anger  and  mobilization.  The  masses  withdraw  their  consent  from  the  regime,  step  beyond  fear ,  and
embrace the risks of upheaval . We will see this pattern recur: France in 1789 had rising bread prices
after an era of Enlightenment hope; Russia in 1917 had a modernizing society plunged into war and
hunger; Iran in 1979 saw two decades of oil-fueled growth create a middle class that then faced soaring
inflation and autocracy . In each, a sense of thwarted expectations and “unfulfilled promises” proved
explosive.23

Thus,  whether  through  Marxian  class  conflict,  Polanyian  countermovements,  Hayek’s  cautions,  or  the
relative deprivation thesis, the conclusion is similar .  When large groups of people lose the ability to
achieve economic dignity through normal channels, they often seek redress through extraordinary
political action.  Declining economic agency – if widespread and prolonged – erodes the legitimacy of the
status quo and empowers radical voices calling for change. Sometimes the pressure releases via elections
or reforms; other times, it breaches the dikes of order and inundates society in revolution. The following
historical  narrative  illustrates  this  feedback  loop  across  different  cultures  and  centuries,  showing  how
economic disempowerment has continuously bred political willpower in myriad forms.
Revolutions of the Enlightenment Era: America, France, and Haiti
In the late 18th century, the Atlantic world was rocked by a series of revolutions that introduced the modern
age of democracy and human rights. At their core, the American, French, and Haitian Revolutions were all
struggles over economic agency as much as political principle. In each case, people who felt economically
shackled by unjust authority rose up to assert control over their own destinies. The specific grievances
differed – taxes and trade restrictions in America, feudal dues and bread prices in France, slavery in Haiti –
but all reflected a populace denied fair rewards for their work and denied a voice in the rules under which
they labored. Their revolutions sought to overturn those conditions, often inspired by Enlightenment ideals
of liberty and equality, but triggered by very material hardships and exclusions.
The  American  Revolution  (1775–1783)  began  as  a  conflict  over  economic  rights  and  governance  in
Britain’s thirteen colonies. For much of the colonial period, Americans had enjoyed relative autonomy in
managing their affairs. But after 1763, the British Crown and Parliament imposed a succession of taxes and
trade laws to extract revenue and control colonial commerce. This sudden tightening of imperial control –
coming after the costly Seven Years’ War – was perceived by colonists as an attack on their livelihood and
freedoms. As the U.S. State Department’s historical office notes, the Revolution “was precipitated, in part, by
a series of laws passed between 1763 and 1775 regulating trade and taxes,” which caused growing tensions
. London demanded that Americans buy stamps for legal documents, pay duties on sugar and tea,
quarter British soldiers, and refrain from issuing their own paper money . These measures were not
only  economic  burdens;  they  were  implemented  without  any  colonial  representation  in  Parliament.
Colonists loudly protested “ no taxation without representation ,” insisting that levying taxes without their
consent violated their rights as Englishmen . When their petitions fell on deaf ears – “British Parliament
would not address American complaints that the new laws were onerous”  – many colonists concluded
that they were being treated as subjects of a corrupt empire, deprived of the traditional liberties due to free
British citizens . Their economic agency was at stake: they had no say over taxes that affected their
property, and trade regulations threatened their prosperity. The colonial elite and common farmers alike
bridled at this loss of autonomy .
By the early 1770s, economic resistance merged with a broader desire for self-government. Committees of
correspondence and popular assemblies coordinated boycotts of British goods, hitting British merchants in
the pocketbook. In December 1773, the famous Boston Tea Party saw colonists destroy a shipment of taxed
tea rather than submit to an unjust levy . Britain’s retaliatory “Intolerable Acts” in 1774 only deepened
the crisis – closing Boston’s port and altering the Massachusetts charter , further strangling economic life
and local governance . In response, the colonies convened a Continental Congress. When King George
III’s government refused to compromise and instead sent troops, armed conflict broke out in 1775. The
ideology of the American Revolution was one of natural rights and social contract theory, but it was the
practical grievances over economic agency and political voice  that galvanized ordinary colonists. The18

Declaration of Independence (1776) included among its litany of grievances the cutting off of colonial trade,
the imposition of taxes without consent, and the ignoring of petitions for redress . These were
fundamentally  complaints  that  Americans  were  being  ruled  and  economically  exploited  by  a  distant
authority in which they had no representation. Only by achieving independence could they safeguard the
rights to make their own laws, control their own resources, and pursue their own economic opportunities.
Thus, the American Revolution can be seen as a revolution for economic agency – to secure the labor rights
(no arbitrary quartering or trade restrictions), property rights (fair taxation and no confiscatory policies),
and democratic rights (representation in decisions) that the colonists believed were essential to their liberty
and prosperity.
Across the ocean, France in the 1780s  was a far more dire picture of economic disempowerment, one that
ignited arguably the most consequential revolution in modern history.  The French Revolution of 1789
erupted from a society in which millions of ordinary people – peasants, laborers, the urban poor – were
crushed by taxes, rising prices, and feudal exactions, while a privileged elite paid little and monopolized
power . France’s economy had been stagnating under the weight of royal debt and archaic feudal structures.
Throughout the 18th century, population growth put pressure on food supplies . By 1788, a severe
winter devastated harvests; famine loomed, and in the countryside people starved. In cities like Paris, the
price of bread – the staple of the urban diet – had been climbing sharply, provoking  bread riots  among
desperate crowds . A PBS history summary vividly describes the situation: a rapidly growing population
had outpaced the food supply; a terrible winter in 1788 led to widespread starvation; soaring bread prices
in Paris brought hungry crowds into the streets . By the spring of 1789, France’s fiscal and economic
crisis  was  acute:  the  royal  treasury  was  bankrupt  (France  was  “broke”  by  1789 ),  yet  the  King’s
government  could  not  squeeze  any  more  taxes  from  an  already  overburdened  Third  Estate  (the
commoners). The tax system was blatantly unjust  – the First Estate (clergy) and Second Estate (nobility)
owned most of the land and paid minimal taxes, while the Third Estate (everyone else, from bourgeois
merchants to landless peasants) owned little yet was heavily taxed . Peasants still owed feudal dues to
noble landlords and the Church, further draining their meager incomes. It is little wonder that one French
clergyman observed on the eve of 1789 that the peasantry “ ate grass ” like sheep when their grain ran out –
a striking image of human despair .
By  1789,  France’s  King  Louis  XVI,  an  indecisive  monarch  fond  of  locksmithing  more  than  governing,
recognized that a crisis loomed . Pressured by the bankruptcy of the state and the plight of his subjects,
Louis XVI convened the Estates-General, a national assembly of the three estates, for the first time since
1614. This was effectively an admission that the absolutist system had failed; some new social contract was
needed.  The  representatives  of  the  Third  Estate  –  drawn  from  the  bourgeoisie  and  reform-minded
commoners – arrived with demands for relief: they wanted voting power in proportion to their numbers
(since they far outnumbered clergy and nobles) and reforms to curb the privileges of the elites. When the
King and the nobles hesitated and insisted on the old one-estate, one-vote format (in which the tiny First
and Second Estates could outvote the Third), the Third Estate boldly broke away in June 1789 and declared
itself the National Assembly , vowing not to disband until France had a constitution guaranteeing rights.
The King’s attempt to shut them down by force backfired spectacularly. On July 14, 1789, the people of Paris
rose in armed insurrection and stormed the Bastille fortress – a symbol of royal tyranny – in search of
weapons  and  desperately  needed  food.  Contemporary  accounts  note  that  many  of  the  Parisians  who
attacked the Bastille were literally hunting for flour and grain  amid rumors that stores of food were kept in
the  fortress .  Indeed,  the  spark  of  the  French  Revolution  was  a  bread  riot  elevated  to  a
revolutionary break . A recent analysis by the World Economic Forum points out that the French Revolution
“was preceded by an estimated 55% rise in the cost of bread” in the years leading up to 1789 . Such a1822

dramatic surge in basic food prices meant starvation for the poor and signaled that the old regime could no
longer  guarantee  the  most  elementary  economic  security.  In  the  countrysides  that  summer ,  peasants
terrified of both hunger and rumored aristocratic plots launched the  Grande Peur  (Great Fear), sacking
manor houses and destroying feudal contracts. Faced with this popular fury, the National Assembly in
August 1789 abolished feudal privileges and issued the  Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the
Citizen , proclaiming liberty, property, and security as natural rights. The French Revolution thus began as a
revolt of the economically disempowered  – those who could not afford bread, who bore an unfair tax
load, who had no say in government – and it aimed to create a new order in which the people’s agency  over
their own lives would be respected. In the revolutionary slogans of “Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité,” one hears
not  only  abstract  ideals  but  very  concrete  demands:  freedom  from  feudal  dues  and  arbitrary  arrests,
equality of taxation and opportunity, and brotherhood in deciding the nation’s fate collectively rather than
suffering under an aloof aristocracy. The outcome, tumultuous and at times extraordinarily violent, would
transform France and indeed all of Europe. But it began with mothers and fathers crying out that their
families had no bread, and deciding they must seize power  so that they might eat.
Only  a  few  years  after  the  Bastille  fell,  an  even  more  marginalized  and  oppressed  population  took
revolutionary action in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (modern Haiti). The Haitian Revolution (1791–
1804)  stands  as  one  of  history’s  most  dramatic  assertions  of  economic  agency  by  the  utterly
disenfranchised. On the eve of the revolt in 1791, Saint-Domingue was the richest colony in the Americas – a
lush land whose sugar and coffee plantations generated great wealth for a small class of white planters and
merchants. However , that prosperity was built on the backs of an enormous enslaved population of African
origin, who had zero rights  and lived under one of the most brutal slave regimes in the world. About 90%
of the population were enslaved Africans , enduring backbreaking labor and cruel punishments . The
remainder of the population consisted of white colonists – both grand plantation owners and poorer whites
– and a sizeable group of affranchis  (free people of mixed race or freed blacks), some of whom had achieved
property and wealth but still faced racial discrimination and legal disabilities. The social powder keg was
enormous. The French Revolution itself served as a spark: the ideals of liberty and equality resonated in the
Caribbean,  and  the  tumult  in  France  weakened  the  authority  that  kept  a  lid  on  colonial  grievances.
According  to  Encyclopædia  Britannica,  the  causes  of  the  Haitian  Revolution  included  “the  affranchis’
frustrated aspirations, the brutality of slave owners , and inspiration from the French Revolution” . 
For the enslaved, economic agency was non-existent  – they themselves were treated as property . They toiled
from dawn to dusk cutting cane, with no say in their conditions, their families frequently torn apart, and any
resistance met with the whip or worse. Even the affranchis who owned property could not vote or hold
equal status with whites. This systematic denial of rights and dignity led to a tipping point. In August 1791,
a massive slave uprising erupted in the northern plain of Haiti, with enslaved people burning plantations
and slaughtering masters in the name of freedom. It was the first successful slave revolt in history, and it
unleashed years of bloody struggle. Leaders like Toussaint Louverture, himself a former slave, organized
armies of formerly enslaved fighters who proved extraordinarily resilient and adaptive. The stakes of this
war were nothing less than the economic agency of an entire people  – the right of Haitians to be free
laborers, to own land, to live under laws of their own making rather than under the whip of a master . After
over a decade of conflict (which also involved Spain and Britain and multiple shifts in France’s revolutionary
government), the insurgents prevailed. In 1804, Haiti declared independence, becoming the first black-led
republic and abolishing slavery. The success of the Haitian Revolution sent shockwaves through the world.
It was a profound example that when a population is pushed into the most abject powerlessness – chattel
slavery – their uprising can be ferocious and unyielding. The enslaved had literally nothing  to lose except
their chains, and they fought with a determination born of that truth. Haiti’s was thus a social revolution of30

unparalleled scope: those at the bottom of the economic and social hierarchy completely overturned the
structure. They demonstrated in the starkest way that denial of economic agency (in this case, outright
enslavement) will eventually be answered by an equally absolute demand for liberty . In the process,
they not only broke their own shackles but forced the French (and the world) to reckon with slavery’s
cruelties; in 1794, amidst the chaos, the French Convention even voted to abolish slavery (though Napoleon
later  reversed  it) .  Haiti’s  founders  explicitly  linked  political  rights  with  economic  ones,  dividing
plantations among the former slaves so they could sustain themselves. However , Haiti also illustrates how
fraught the aftermath can be: international isolation and indemnities imposed by France strangled the new
nation’s  economy  for  generations,  complicating  the  realization  of  true  economic  agency  even  after
independence. Nonetheless, the revolution in Saint-Domingue remains a towering testament to the human
quest for self-determination in the economic sphere. As one Haitian revolutionary reportedly said, upon
being offered reform in lieu of independence: “I  preferred losing everything  to losing my liberty.” The
pursuit of economic agency can indeed become an all-or-nothing proposition.
By the early 19th century, the example of these Atlantic revolutions had emblazoned a new concept on the
world’s consciousness: the idea that it is legitimate for a people to overthrow their rulers if those rulers deprive
them of basic rights and economic fairness . The American Revolution established a republic where property
owners  could  vote  and  influence  tax  policy;  the  French  Revolution  (despite  cycles  of  turmoil)  ended
feudalism in France and spread principles of equality under the law; the Haitian Revolution smashed the
abhorrent institution of slavery and founded a nation of self-liberated workers. Each revolution had unique
outcomes  and  philosophical  underpinnings,  but  all  were  fueled  by  populations  who  felt  profoundly
economically disempowered  under the old regimes. This era proved the explosive potential of popular will
when ignited by economic grievances. In the next section, we will see how the 19th century continued these
trends, with further struggles by workers and peasants to secure a larger share of agency in the new
industrial  age  –  and  how  the  failure  to  accommodate  those  struggles  sometimes  led  to  cataclysmic
rebellions.
The Long 19th Century: Industrialization, Labor, and Social Unrest
After the initial wave of late-18th-century revolutions, the 19th century introduced new economic forces that
again tested societies’ ability to grant broad economic agency. The  Industrial Revolution  transformed
economies  from  agrarian  to  industrial,  creating  new  classes  of  factory  workers  and  capitalists  and
disrupting traditional ways of life. Rapid urbanization and the spread of capitalist market relations often
meant that old protections – the village commons, guild regulations, patronage networks – fell away,
leaving  individuals  at  the  mercy  of  impersonal  market  forces.  Early  industrial  capitalism  notoriously
involved  harsh  working  conditions:  long  hours  in  mills  and  mines,  child  labor ,  meager  wages,  and
hazardous environments, all with little political voice for the workers who endured them. At the same time,
population growth in places like Europe and China strained resources, and periodic crop failures brought
hunger . The “dual revolution”  (industrial and political) of this era created both new opportunities and new
inequalities.  For  those  left  behind  or  pushed  down,  the  19th  century  offered  a  range  of  responses:
organized labor movements, social reforms through legislation, or in more extreme cases, armed uprisings
and revolutions. We observe in this century the continued truth that when established powers failed to
adapt to the economic needs and rights of the populace, explosive unrest was the result .
One of the earliest signs of trouble was the wave of revolutions that swept Europe in 1848 , often called the
“Springtime of Nations.” Although not listed in our core examples, the 1848 revolutions deserve a brief
mention as they were driven partly by economic crisis. A continent-wide recession and  famine  (after the31
6
potato blight of 1845–47) left many jobless and hungry; food prices spiked, much as bread had in 1789. In
France, for instance, the February 1848 revolution that ousted King Louis-Philippe was precipitated by rising
bread prices and unemployment in the 1840s . Across the Austrian Empire, German states, and Italy,
artisans and workers  joined with middle-class liberals to demand constitutions, voting rights, and social
relief.  Though  most  of  these  revolutions  were  suppressed  or  fizzled  by  1849,  they  prompted  some
monarchies to (temporarily) abolish feudal dues or consider welfare measures. The pattern was clear:
economic suffering – in this case stemming from a bad harvest and industrial slowdown – had mobilized
masses  of  people  to  push  for  political  change  and  greater  representation.  Notably,  Karl  Marx  was
observing and writing during this period, and the failure of the 1848 revolutions to secure lasting reforms
only reinforced his conviction that more fundamental, class-based revolution was on the horizon.
In the colonial and non-Western world, the mid-19th century also saw dramatic upheavals tied to economic
agency. A prime example is the Taiping Rebellion in China (1850–1864)  – one of the deadliest conflicts in
human history, in which tens of millions perished. The Taiping Rebellion was in many ways a  peasant
revolution against unbearable economic conditions  in the Qing Dynasty. By the mid-1800s, China was
suffering from internal crises even before the shock of Western imperialism. The population had exploded
from about 150 million in 1700 to some 430 million by 1850 . This immense growth put extreme
pressure on land and food supply –  land shortages  and  famine  became widespread . As an Asia for
Educators  summary  from  Columbia  University  describes,  “the  inevitable  results  were  land  shortages,
famine, and an increasingly impoverished rural population” . Millions of peasants had too little land to
sustain their families.  Heavy taxes  – often to pay indemnities from the Opium Wars or to support local
officials – weighed on these peasants, while inflation  eroded their purchasing power . To make matters
worse, many local officials were corrupt or inept, and the imperial bureaucracy was failing to maintain
infrastructure  (like  flood-control  works)  that  farmers  depended  on .  Traditional  protections  were
breaking down, and peasants felt  betrayed  by their rulers’ inability to relieve suffering. In some regions,
unemployed  vagrants  and  bandits  roamed,  reflecting  the  breakdown  of  order .  The  stage  was  set  for
rebellion.
Enter  Hong  Xiuquan ,  a  charismatic  visionary  who  combined  heterodox  Christian  theology  with  social
revolutionary ideas. Hong proclaimed himself a messianic leader and gathered followers (the Taipings ) with
promises to create a new heavenly kingdom of peace. Critically, the Taiping program appealed to peasants
by  denouncing the economic injustices  of Qing China. They advocated radical land redistribution – the
Taiping  Heavenly  Kingdom’s  policies  called  for  land  to  be  divided  among  families  according  to  size,
essentially an early form of communistic equality. They also decried the idle rich and corrupt officials. The
movement gained steam in the early 1850s as disaffected peasants, laborers, and even miners flocked to
Hong’s banner . As one source notes, the rebellion began in the southern province of Guangxi, which had
suffered “decline of rural economy and cottage industries” and  loss of livelihoods for many peasants ,
combined  with  an  increasing  tax  burden  on  those  same  peasants .  Simply  put,  local  economic
depression and misery were fuel for the Taiping flame . By 1853, the Taipings had captured the major city
of Nanjing and turned it into their capital, threatening to topple the Qing. The ensuing civil war raged for
over a decade. It was staggeringly bloody – by some estimates, 20 to 30 million or even more died from
warfare and the resulting famine and disease . Ultimately, the Qing, with foreign assistance, crushed the
Taipings by 1864. But the rebellion had nearly destroyed the dynasty and forced urgent reforms. The lesson
here is that the Qing regime’s inability to address peasant poverty, inflation, and injustice led to one
of history’s largest uprisings . It was a stark case of declining economic agency – peasants felt they had no
way within the system to better their lot – leading to millenarian revolt. The Taipings’ dream was not only
religious; it was socio-economic, envisioning a society where the tillers of soil would no longer be exploited32
3334

by landlords and mandarins. While that dream perished in rivers of blood, its impact was profound. The
Qing  government,  shaken,  belatedly  undertook  some  “Self-Strengthening”  policies  and  attempted  tax
reforms, though with limited success. And long-term, the resentment of economic disempowerment in
China would surface again in the 20th-century revolutions (first republican, then communist). The Taiping
Rebellion thus exemplifies how mass economic grievances can coalesce into a revolutionary movement
with transformative – and tragic – consequences .
Back in Europe, the second half of the 19th century was marked less by violent revolution and more by the
rise of organized labor and social reform within the system , especially in the industrializing nations.
After 1850, Britain, France, Germany, and the United States all saw the emergence of trade unions, working-
class  political  parties,  and  reformist  movements  that  aimed  to  address  economic  injustices  without
overthrowing society entirely. In many cases, the ruling elites had learned from 1789 and 1848 that some
concession was wiser than none . For example, in Britain, the franchise was gradually expanded (Reform
Acts of 1832, 1867, 1884) to give the urban middle and working classes a voice, and labor unions were
legalized  and  grew  by  late  century.  Germany’s  Chancellor  Bismarck  introduced  the  world’s  first  social
insurance  programs  in  the  1880s  (health  insurance,  accident  insurance,  old-age  pensions)  explicitly  to
undercut socialist agitation by improving workers’ security. These measures can be seen as part of what
Polanyi  described  –  society  pushing  back  to  re-embed  economic  relations  in  social  welfare,  thereby
empowering workers with some agency and stake in the system . Indeed, as Milton Friedman noted,
19th-century Britain did experience political reforms that enfranchised more people and coincided with
economic liberalization that raised living standards, suggesting that granting some political voice to the
masses helped channel discontent into constructive change . By giving workers the vote and modest
protections, the theory went, you reduce the appeal of the barricades.
However , even as reforms progressed in some places, new flashpoints of acute economic disempowerment
emerged elsewhere, leading to further political convulsions as the 19th century turned into the 20th. We
now turn to the early 20th century, where two World Wars and a Great Depression would create conditions
that put the previous century’s lessons to the ultimate test.
Early 20th Century: War, Revolution, and the Great Depression
The first decades of the 20th century were an age of extremes. On one hand, industrial capitalism matured
and globalized, creating unprecedented wealth and technological progress. On the other , that era saw the
most destructive wars in history and the collapse of old empires. The Russian Revolution of 1917  and the
subsequent rise of communist and fascist movements were direct responses to the failures of existing
systems  to  ensure  economic  security  and  equity,  especially  in  times  of  crisis.  Then  came  the  Great
Depression of the 1930s , a collapse of the global economy so severe that it swept aside governments and
ideologies  like  dry  leaves.  Throughout  these  events,  the  thread  persists:  when  people  by  the  millions
experience  economic  catastrophe  or  stark  inequality,  the  result  is  a  surge  of  radical  political  will  –
sometimes veering left toward revolution, sometimes right toward authoritarianism, but always demanding
a restructuring of the social order that had failed to deliver basic well-being.
The Russian Revolution: “Peace, Land, and Bread”
By the early 1900s, Russia  was a tinderbox of discontent. Despite some industrialization, it remained one of
Europe’s poorest, most backward countries, with a huge peasant majority  living in semi-feudal conditions
and  a  growing  class  of  urban  factory  workers  laboring  long  hours  for  low  wages.  A  HISTORY  profile13

observes  that  around  1900,  “Russia  was  one  of  the  most  impoverished  countries  in  Europe  with  an
enormous peasantry and a growing minority of poor industrial workers” . Unlike in Western Europe,
where  workers  had  begun  to  win  the  vote  or  union  rights,  Tsarist  Russia  was  an  autocracy  with  no
parliament (until after 1905), no legal political parties, and harsh repression of dissent . Serfdom – a
form of bondage tying peasants to nobles’ land – had been abolished in 1861, but emancipation was done
on terms unfavorable to peasants, saddling them with redemption payments and too little land. By the
1910s,  many  peasants  were  land-hungry,  still  renting  plots  from  gentry  or  crowded  on  communal
allotments that barely sustained families. In the cities, industrial workers toiled in grueling conditions, and
any attempt to strike or organize could be met with Cossack sabers and police jailings. The Tsar’s regime
offered neither economic opportunity nor political voice  to the masses. 
Discontent had been brewing for years (the Revolution of 1905, sparked by defeat in war and a massacre of
peaceful protesters, had forced the Tsar to allow a weak representative assembly, the Duma, but much of
that promise was rolled back). Then came World War I (1914–1918)  – a conflict that Russia entered with
patriotic  fervor ,  only  to  find  itself  disastrously  unprepared.  By  1916–17,  the  war  had  ravaged  Russia’s
economy. The German invasion and the Russian army’s incompetence caused the deaths of millions of
peasant-soldiers and the dislocation of agriculture. Food became scarce; the cities, especially Petrograd (St.
Petersburg), faced  severe bread shortages . Inflation soared – by 1916, prices had reportedly risen over
400%, rendering money nearly worthless for ordinary people . In the frigid winter of 1917, Petrograd’s
workers and their families stood in bread lines for hours, only to be told no bread remained. Hunger bit
deeply, and morale plummeted. The slogan that encapsulated the people’s demands was tellingly simple:
“Peace,  Land,  and  Bread .”  Peace  –  an  end  to  the  war  that  was  consuming  Russia’s  youth;  Land  –
redistribution to the peasants; Bread – food for all.
In March 1917 (February by the old Russian calendar), the simmering discontent boiled over . It began,
fittingly, with a women-led bread riot  in Petrograd on International Women’s Day. These women, fed up
with waiting in bread lines while their men were at the front, marched through the streets demanding
bread. Factory workers joined, and soon large crowds were chanting not just for bread but also “Down with
Autocracy!” The Tsar’s troops initially opened fire, but soon even soldiers (many themselves peasants in
uniform) mutinied and joined the uprising. Within days, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated. This February Revolution
was a spontaneous, leaderless outburst of popular anger after years of suffering. A BBC summary notes:
“Economic problems grew, made worse by Russia’s disastrous involvement in World War One. Social unrest
led  to  the  February  Revolution  and  [the  Tsar’s]  abdication” .  Indeed,  economic  hardship,  food
shortages and government corruption all contributed to disillusionment with Czar Nicholas II  and the
collapse  of  the  old  order .  A  provisional  government  of  liberals  and  moderate  socialists  took  over ,
pledging to continue the war and implement reforms.
But  the  Russian  people’s  demand  for  immediate  relief  was  not  met  –  the  war  dragged  on,  and  the
provisional government delayed land reform and food distribution, partly out of reluctance and partly
chaos. This opened the door for the more radical Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin, who campaigned on
the promise to give the people exactly what they wanted: peace, land, bread, now. Through the tumultuous
summer and fall of 1917, the Bolsheviks gained support in the workers’ councils (soviets) and among
soldiers. In October (November new style) 1917, they seized power in Petrograd in a nearly bloodless coup,
toppling the provisional government. Lenin’s new regime immediately sought a peace with Germany (which
was finalized in early 1918 at huge territorial cost), decreed the land of the gentry to be confiscated and
given to peasant committees, and took steps to ensure urban workers food supply (though civil war would
upend those efforts). The  Russian Revolution thus completed its course from economic misery to38

radical  political  change :  what  began  as  a  desperate  bread  riot  ended  less  than  a  year  later  in  the
establishment of the world’s first socialist state, committed (in theory) to abolishing the private ownership
of land and capital and empowering workers and peasants through soviet (council) democracy.
It is hard to overstate how much the  collapse of economic order  primed Russia for revolution. One
contemporary described that by early 1917 “food and fuel shortages plagued Russia as inflation mounted.
The already weak economy was breaking under the strain of war” . Women screamed for bread; soldiers
bled on the front; at home, wages, if paid, lost value by the day. The old regime’s officials were widely seen
as incompetent or indifferent – indeed Tsar Nicholas II is infamous for his obliviousness, writing in his diary
about trivial daily routines while Petrograd burned. Hunger had led to revolution  in a very literal sense
.  When  the  Bolsheviks  took  power ,  it  was  not  just  because  of  their  ideology;  it  was  because  they
connected with the elemental needs of the masses. As one of Lenin’s colleagues, Leon Trotsky, put it, the
masses were not initially dreaming of socialist utopia – they wanted “ the end of war, bread, and land ,” and it
was the Bolsheviks’ ability to represent those immediate yearnings that gave them credibility. Of course, the
aftermath  would  be  complex:  a  devastating  civil  war ,  the  eventual  establishment  of  a  one-party
authoritarian state under the Communists. But the roots of 1917 show clearly that political authority that
cannot provide economic security is doomed . The Tsarist system had offered neither prosperity nor a
voice to the people – and ultimately, the people withdrew their consent in the most direct way possible.
The Russian Revolution sent shockwaves worldwide. For the first time, Marx’s prediction of a proletarian
revolution had come true (albeit in a largely agrarian country). It inspired workers’ uprisings in Germany,
Hungary, and elsewhere in 1918–1919 (though these were suppressed), and it terrified the propertied
classes everywhere. The specter of communism spurred reforms in some countries aimed at undercutting
extreme left appeal – for example, many European nations expanded suffrage to all men (and in some cases
women) right after World War I, partly to appease worker demands. In the 1920s, however , a period of
relative prosperity returned to parts of the world (the “Roaring Twenties” in the U.S. and Europe), and it
seemed  perhaps  that  the  worst  of  class  conflict  had  passed.  That  illusion  would  not  last.  The  Great
Depression , beginning with the U.S. stock market crash of 1929, plunged the world into an economic crisis
far worse than anything seen before, and it unleashed another wave of political earthquakes.
The Great Depression: Economic Collapse and Political Earthquakes
The  Great Depression (1929–1939)  was a global economic cataclysm – a  worldwide  depression that saw
industrial production plummet, tens of millions unemployed, and hunger and desperation even in wealthy
nations. It constituted the ultimate stress test for governments: could they preserve social stability and
reform their economies to help citizens regain agency? In many countries the answer was no – at least not
before significant political upheaval. In some cases, that upheaval took the form of democratic reform and a
new social contract (as with the New Deal in the United States). In others, it took the form of extreme
ideologies on the right or left seizing power , as people lost faith in liberal democracy and capitalism itself.
Declining economic agency during the Depression – manifest in mass unemployment, loss of savings
in bank failures, and plummeting incomes – led directly to surging political movements  that promised
to restore dignity and control to the forgotten common man, whether through socialist revolution, fascist
nationalism, or welfare-state intervention.
The statistics of the Great Depression convey the scale of economic breakdown. In the United States, the
epicenter , real GDP fell by roughly 30% between 1929 and 1933 . By 1933, U.S.  unemployment had
soared to 25% , meaning one in four American workers was jobless . Some 9,000 banks failed, wiping42
43

out  many  people’s  life  savings .  About  one-third  of  American  farmers  lost  their  land  due  to
foreclosure or inability to pay debts . Breadlines and soup kitchens appeared in every city; photographs
of the time famously show grim-faced men in flat caps lining up for free soup and bread – a previously
unthinkable sight in the land of plenty . An iconic image from Chicago in 1931 shows unemployed
men queued outside a soup kitchen (reportedly sponsored by the gangster Al Capone) under a sign that
reads “Free Soup, Coffee & Doughnuts for the Unemployed” – a stark illustration of sudden mass destitution
.  In  a  matter  of  a  few  years,  millions  of  Americans  went  from  relative  comfort  to  utter
economic powerlessness.
Unemployed men queue outside a soup kitchen in Chicago during the Great Depression (February 1931). With
unemployment at 25% by 1933, breadlines and soup kitchens became a common sight across the United States
. The sudden mass unemployment and poverty exemplified the collapse of economic agency for ordinary
people in the Depression.
And the U.S. was not alone. Worldwide, it is estimated that gross domestic product fell by about 15%
between  1929  and  1932 .  By  1932,  international  trade  had  contracted  by  more  than  50% ,  as
protective tariffs rose and demand plummeted . Many countries hit unemployment rates well into the
double digits – for instance, Germany’s unemployment reached nearly 30% , contributing to social chaos
. In  some countries unemployment rose as high as 33%  (one in three) . Prices fell (deflation),
which might sound good for consumers, but in fact it crushed farmers and anyone with debt, because
incomes fell even faster . The collapse was so profound that it shook confidence in the entire capitalist
system. Desperate populations looked for anyone who could offer a way out – and as a result, political
extremes gained appeal.
In the United States, mass unrest was a real concern by the early 1930s. There were instances of violence –
such as the Bonus Army  incident in 1932, when thousands of destitute World War I veterans marched on
Washington, D.C., to demand early payment of a promised bonus and were forcibly dispersed by the Army.
Farmers banded together in some areas to block foreclosures, even physically intimidating sheriffs to halt
auctions of repossessed farms. In urban centers, communist and socialist groups gained some following by45

arguing that capitalism had failed and that workers should take control. The 1932 presidential election
became a watershed: the incumbent Herbert Hoover was seen (not entirely fairly) as callously inactive in the
face of suffering, while Franklin D. Roosevelt promised a “New Deal” for the “forgotten man.” Roosevelt won
in a landslide. Once in office, FDR launched a flurry of programs to provide emergency relief, jobs, and
economic reform – from the Civilian Conservation Corps employing young men in public works, to Social
Security for the elderly, to laws empowering labor unions and regulating banks. These New Deal policies in
effect acknowledged that without state intervention, the economic agency of millions would never be
restored ,  and  social  upheaval  could  be  imminent.  As  Polanyi  later  argued,  Roosevelt’s  New  Deal  “re-
embedded”  the economy in society’s needs, creating safety nets and labor rights that blunted the appeal of
radical alternatives. Indeed, some historians suggest the New Deal may have saved  American capitalism by
reforming it – heading off what could have been more revolutionary movements. The U.S. did see populist
demagogues like Huey Long (with his “Share Our Wealth” plan) gain traction in this period, but ultimately
the New Deal absorbed enough discontent to preserve constitutional government. 
In contrast,  Germany  provides a tragic counter-example of what can happen when economic collapse
meets a vacuum of effective response. The Weimar Republic was hit brutally by the Depression: German
unemployment spiked to around 30% by 1932 . The government, constrained by political infighting and
orthodox economic thinking, initially responded with austerity – cutting spending and trying to balance
budgets – which only worsened the misery. Millions of ordinary Germans lost their jobs, their savings (many
had already seen savings wiped out by the hyperinflation of 1923), and their trust in mainstream parties.
Into this breach stepped radical parties – the Communists on the left and the Nazis (National Socialists) on
the right. Both promised to empower the downtrodden: the Communists talked of workers’ revolution; the
Nazis blamed Jews, “finance capital,” and the Versailles treaty for Germany’s woes and promised national
revival. In the early 1930s, street politics in Germany turned violent, with paramilitary wings of Nazis and
Communists clashing. Ultimately, the Nazi Party under Adolf Hitler – riding a wave of angry, desperate
lower-middle-class and working-class support – became the largest party and was handed power in
1933 . A telling data point: in 1928, before the Depression, the Nazis had a mere 2.6% of the vote; by July
1932, in the depth of the crisis, they garnered 37% in a national election. The Depression “fueled political
extremism, paving the way for Adolf Hitler’s Nazi Party to rise to power in 1933” . Once in power , Hitler
dismantled democracy and instituted a fascist dictatorship that would wreak havoc on the world. The direct
connection  between  economic  disempowerment  and  this  outcome  is  widely  acknowledged.  A  World
Economic Forum piece notes that hyperinflation and depression-era joblessness in Germany were closely
studied and led to the consensus that these economic conditions contributed enormously to the Nazi rise
. Hitler’s message of restoring German pride and punishing scapegoats resonated with those who
felt humiliated by unemployment and poverty. In essence,  the collapse of economic agency – skilled
laborers and clerks lining up for soup, families unable to feed children – had led a critical mass of
Germans to reject liberal democracy entirely  and seek salvation in an authoritarian regime promising
order and full employment (achieved later through rearmament and public works). The lesson was grim: a
modern, educated society had succumbed to totalitarianism largely because of economic despair and lost
faith in incremental solutions.
Other countries had their own turbulences. In Great Britain , the Depression wasn’t as severe as in the U.S.
or Germany, but unemployment still exceeded 20% in the early 1930s in many industrial areas. This led to
the rise of the Labour Party and some social unrest (like the 1932 Hunger Marches). Britain formed a
National Government (a coalition) to try to cope, and while democracy survived, it was tested. In nations like
Italy and Japan , the Depression further empowered fascist or militarist factions (Italy was already under
Mussolini’s fascism since the 1920s; Japan’s military took greater control in the 1930s, partly driven by the49
49
5051
12
need to secure resources for a suffering economy). In many  Latin American  countries, the Depression
triggered  political  changes  as  well  –  some  democracies  fell  to  authoritarian  regimes,  while  elsewhere
populist leaders like Getúlio Vargas in Brazil or Juan Perón (later in Argentina, post-WWII) emerged by
promising the masses a better deal. The economic agony everywhere demanded new approaches. 
The  global nature of the Depression  also meant that people drew broader conclusions about systems.
Many around the world saw the Soviet Union – which was not as affected by the global downturn due to its
planned economy (though it had its own horrific issues with forced collectivization and famine) – as proof
that capitalism was unstable. Others saw the New Deal in America as a model that capitalism could be
humanized. And ominously, some saw Hitler’s and Mussolini’s regimes as models of vigorous action (they
did seem to end unemployment quicker , albeit by suppression and war preparation). The stakes of getting
the response right were enormous, as the subsequent world war would show.
By the late 1930s, the worst of the Depression was ending (in part due to rearmament and eventual
wartime spending). But the political landscape had been permanently altered. In the U.S., citizens now
accepted  a  much  larger  federal  role  in  the  economy  –  a  “new  normal”  where  the  government  would
intervene to stabilize employment and provide a social safety net. In Western Europe after WWII, many
nations built welfare states that guaranteed healthcare, education, and income support, explicitly to avoid
the conditions that gave rise to fascism. This was in keeping with Polanyi’s argument that society, having
been ravaged by the market collapse, demanded a re-embedding of economic life in social protections
. Even conservative leaders after the war accepted measures like public housing or unemployment
insurance as bulwarks against extreme discontent. The idea was clear: never again should so many feel so
abandoned in their hour of need, lest the Western democracies tear themselves apart .
In summary, the Great Depression demonstrated the extremes of the feedback loop between economic
collapse and political change . It led to some of the worst outcomes (the rise of Nazi Germany and the
road to World War II) and also some of the most progressive (the New Deal, which arguably saved U.S.
democracy, and post-war social democratic reforms). An insightful observation from the period came from
British economist John Maynard Keynes: if governments did not step in to manage capitalism’s ups and
downs, the public would ultimately lose faith in capitalism and turn to more drastic remedies. Keynes’s
advocacy  of  demand-side  economic  intervention  was  vindicated  by  the  war  mobilization,  which  finally
ended the Depression. The aftermath saw a consensus (at least for a few decades) that high employment
and growth were political priorities – a lesson learned from the blood and strife of the interwar years.
The first half of the 20th century, then, had shown both  the promise and peril of mass political will
unleashed by economic grievances. Communist revolutions had occurred in Russia and elsewhere, fascist
dictatorships had risen on the back of economic resentment, and liberal democracies had proven fragile
unless they adapted. After World War II, a relatively stable period (1945–1970s) in the West, with strong
growth and a broadening middle class, seemed to fulfill the hope that with proper management, the worst
extremes could be avoided. But the story did not end there. The 1970s brought new economic shocks that
tested the system’s resilience and again spurred significant political shifts.
The 1970s: Oil Shocks, Stagflation, and the Crisis of Agency
In the 1970s, the world faced a very different kind of economic challenge:  stagflation , a combination of
stagnant economic growth and high inflation – something that hadn’t happened on a major scale in the
postwar era. The twin  Oil Shocks of 1973 and 1979  were central to this crisis. In 1973, the OPEC oil6
5
13
embargo in the wake of the Arab-Israeli war quadrupled oil prices; in 1979, the Iranian Revolution and
subsequent turmoil doubled prices again. These sudden spikes in the cost of energy rippled through
economies worldwide, causing shortages, price hikes in everything from gasoline to food, and recessions.
Unlike the Great Depression’s deflationary collapse, stagflation was a perplexing malaise: people found
their purchasing power shrinking rapidly  (as prices outpaced wages) while unemployment also climbed –
a nasty combination that defied the conventional economic wisdom of the time.
The Oil Crisis of 1973–74  “knocked the wind out of the global economy,” as one analysis put it . It helped
trigger a stock market crash and soaring inflation and high unemployment , a toxic mix that shattered
the post-WWII optimism . In many Western countries, this led to the fall of governments. For example, in
Britain, the Conservative government of Edward Heath was brought down in 1974 amid miner strikes and
power shortages (the famous Three-Day Work Week, when electricity was rationed). The Guardian  noted
that the oil crisis “ultimately led to the fall of a UK government” . Heath’s government struggled with
rising energy and food costs (food prices were already high due to global shortages), and inflation in Britain
hit over 24% in 1975 . Trade unions pushed for higher wages to keep up with living costs, resulting in
confrontations like the miners’ strike that contributed to Heath’s ouster . This was a case where an
external economic shock (oil prices) translated quickly into  domestic political upheaval . The opposition
framed it as a failure of the government to protect people’s livelihoods, and voters agreed.
Around the world, governments that couldn’t manage the stagflation crisis faced backlash. In the United
States,  inflation  and  economic  stagnation  eroded  popular  confidence  in  the  Keynesian  economic
management that had prevailed. By the late 1970s, the U.S. experienced wage freezes, gas lines (drivers
lining up for hours to buy rationed gasoline in 1974), and malaise. This paved the way for the election of
Ronald Reagan in 1980, who promised to revive the economy through free-market policies – a  dramatic
political turn toward neoliberalism  (tax cuts, deregulation, weakening unions) that represented a break
from the New Deal consensus. Similarly, Britain in 1979 elected Margaret Thatcher , who campaigned on
taming inflation and curbing union power after the “Winter of Discontent” – a period of widespread strikes
in 1978–79 triggered by wage caps and rising living costs. Thus, the economic disempowerment  people
felt – seeing paychecks lose value, jobs becoming insecure, and governments apparently helpless – led
them to support  political change in a new direction . In this case, unlike in the 1930s, the pendulum
swung toward market liberalization rather than collectivist solutions (partly because memories of 1930s
fascism and the presence of the Soviet Union made many Western voters wary of extremes on the right or
left). Hayek and Friedman’s ideas saw real-world application: Thatcher and Reagan explicitly cited them,
arguing that restoring economic freedom (through market forces) was necessary to cure stagflation
and  ensure  political  vitality .  The  long-term  impacts  of  their  policies  –  beneficial  or  otherwise  –  are
debated, but the immediate appeal was clearly rooted in the perception that the old approaches had failed
and left ordinary people adrift.
The Oil Shocks  also had significant impacts beyond the West, notably in the Middle East and developing
world. In particular , the  Iranian Revolution of 1979  stands as a vivid example of how a prosperous but
politically closed society can erupt when an economic downturn hits. In the 1960s and early 1970s, Iran,
under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, had been enjoying rapid economic growth due to oil revenue. The
Shah used this wealth to modernize infrastructure and bolster the military, but his regime was autocratic,
corrupt, and repressively silenced dissent (via the feared SAVAK secret police). By the mid-1970s, however ,
the oil boom turned to bust . The Shah’s ambitious spending led to runaway inflation – one account notes
the oil boom produced an “alarming increase in inflation” and a widening gap between rich and poor .
Wealth was concentrated around the Shah’s court and a small elite; the Shah’s own family reportedly52
52
52
53
54
55
14
amassed billions from oil revenues . Meanwhile, austerity measures  were imposed in 1977 to combat
the inflation, which “disproportionately affected the thousands of poor and unskilled” migrants in Iran’s
cities . These were often recent arrivals from the countryside who had come seeking opportunity during
the  boom,  only  to  find  themselves  in  sprawling  shantytowns,  struggling  with  rising  prices  and
unemployment once the economy cooled. Culturally and religiously conservative, many of these urban poor
became the foot soldiers of the revolution . Thus, Iran in the late 1970s fit a classic profile of  rising
expectations painfully dashed : after two decades of growth, people saw inflation devour their wages and
the regime still unyielding in its authoritarian control. The Shah’s regime also forced Westernizing changes
(like banning traditional dress) and was perceived as beholden to the U.S., fueling broader resentment. By
1978, strikes and protests – initially by educated liberals and Islamist activists – had spread. When soldiers
killed  demonstrators,  more  masses  poured  out  in  mourning  and  protest.  A  broad  coalition  from
communists  to  bazaar  merchants  to  Ayatollah  Khomeini’s  Islamist  followers  coalesced  with  the  single
demand: the Shah must go.
The Iranian Revolution can be directly tied to  declining economic agency among broad swathes of
society . The  waste and inequality of the oil boom , coupled with the sudden inflation and recession,
meant that many Iranians felt their improved standard of living slipping away . They also saw a regime
unwilling to allow any democratic outlet or even criticism. Essentially, Iranians experienced  both  political
repression and economic frustration – a combustible combination. As one scholarly source summarizes, the
oil boom of the 1970s led to “an ‘accelerating gap’ between the rich and poor” and intense anger that the
Shah’s family was the chief beneficiary of oil income . The Shah’s answer to inflation – fining and jailing
merchants  for  high  prices  in  a  populist  “anti-profiteering”  campaign  –  backfired  and  “angered  and
politicized” the traditional merchant class (bazaaris) . By late 1978, millions marched in the streets of
Tehran and other cities, and the army eventually refused to shoot anymore. In early 1979, the Shah fled and
the ancient Persian monarchy collapsed, replaced by an Islamic Republic under Ayatollah Khomeini. Again,
a revolutionary outcome was driven by a broad base of people who felt economically and morally betrayed
by their rulers. One can argue that had the Shah been wiser about managing inflation and inequality – or
more willing to share power – he might have averted the revolution. But as it happened, his intransigence in
both  realms  sealed  his  fate.  The  new  Islamic  Republic  immediately  set  about  redistributing  wealth
(expropriating elite assets, capping rents, etc.) and providing social welfare to the poor – ironically, using oil
money but under a different ideological banner of social justice and religious duty. It also imposed a
theocratic political system, which came with its own restrictions on agency (especially for women and
dissenters). Nonetheless, the 1979 Iranian Revolution stands as a prime example of  mass political will
fueled by economic grievances , toppling one of the strongest regimes in the Middle East.
Elsewhere, the Oil Shocks and the ensuing Third World Debt Crisis  of the early 1980s (when interest rates
spiked and many developing nations could not service their loans) led to what were sometimes called “IMF
riots” or austerity protests. For instance, in countries across Latin America, Africa, and Asia, governments
that imposed austerity measures under International Monetary Fund guidance (cutting food subsidies,
raising fuel prices, etc.) often met with spontaneous protests and riots by citizens who suddenly faced steep
price increases. These included events like the  Caracazo  in Venezuela (1989), a deadly riot against rising
gasoline and transport prices, which we will discuss in a later section on Latin America. The pattern was
similar: when people’s cost of living jumps or their livelihoods are threatened en masse, anger quickly spills
into the streets, and if the political system cannot accommodate their grievances, violence may erupt. A
study cited by the World Economic Forum found that more than half of 198 countries surveyed in recent
times were at increased risk of civil unrest tied to the cost of basic necessities . This is essentially the56

15
lesson of the 1970s repeated: inflation – especially sudden food or fuel inflation – is politically perilous.
People do not passively tighten belts; they demand relief.
By the end of the 1970s and early 1980s, the world saw significant political shifts as a result of the economic
turbulence.  In  the  U.S.  and  U.K.,  as  noted,  it  was  the  rise  of  neoliberal  conservative  governments
(Reagan, Thatcher) determined to break stagflation through free-market measures (and indeed, by the
mid-1980s, inflation was tamed but deindustrialization and inequality began rising – which would have its
own consequences later). In parts of the developing world, the hardship of the early 80s paved the way for
movements to democracy in some cases – for example, the painful debt-crisis years undermined many
military dictatorships in Latin America, contributing to the restoration of civilian governments by late 1980s
(as people were fed up with authoritarian mismanagement of economies). Yet in other places, it caused
persistent instability. The complex feedback loop  was evident: economic change (oil prices, debt, austerity)
would provoke political responses (protests, regime changes, policy shifts), which in turn shaped the next
phase of economic policy (e.g., the global embrace of market liberalization in the 1980s, known as the
Washington Consensus, was partly a reaction to the perceived failures of the statist approaches of the
1970s).
Little did the world know, a few decades later another massive economic shock – the Great Recession of
2008  – would test this balance once again, leading to a new wave of populism and protest. Before that,
however , we should spotlight how these dynamics played out in specific national contexts like Bolivia and
Venezuela , where long histories of economic exclusion led in recent times to major political upheavals or
shifts. These case studies in Latin America illustrate the enduring nature of the struggle for economic
agency and how contemporary movements echo patterns seen in earlier centuries.
Latin American Case Studies: Bolivia and Venezuela – Revolution by
Ballot and in the Streets
Latin America has a rich and turbulent history of popular movements driven by demands for economic
justice and inclusion. Throughout the 20th century, many Latin American countries were characterized by
stark inequality: small elites controlled land and wealth, while indigenous peoples, peasants, and urban
poor had little economic power or political voice. This has led to periodic explosions – revolutions, coups,
populist uprisings – as marginalized groups fought to gain agency. Two instructive examples from different
periods are Bolivia  and Venezuela . In Bolivia, a mid-century revolution and later early 21st-century protests
show the push-and-pull of economic agency in a poor , majority-indigenous nation. In Venezuela, cycles of
boom and bust culminating in the recent collapse underscore how quickly political fortunes change when
basic economic needs go unmet.
Bolivia: From Revolution of 1952 to the “Water and Gas Wars” of the 2000s
Bolivia, one of South America’s poorest countries, has a majority indigenous population that was long
oppressed and excluded under colonial and post-colonial regimes. Economic agency for most Bolivians was
virtually  nil  for  much  of  history:  under  Spanish  rule  and  then  under  local  oligarchies,  indigenous
campesinos were often bound to haciendas, kept illiterate, and denied land ownership or political rights. Tin
mining barons and landowners ran the country while miners and peasants toiled in semi-feudal conditions.
16
In  1952 ,  Bolivia  experienced  a  National  Revolution  that  profoundly  changed  its  society.  Led  by  the
Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR), a coalition of middle-class reformers, workers, and indigenous
peasants, the revolution overthrew the old oligarchy. The causes of the 1952 revolution were rooted in
economic inequity and frustration. Tin miners had faced terrible working conditions and low wages, yet
their labor produced Bolivia’s main export. Peasants were essentially serfs on large estates. The tipping
point came after an earlier attempt at reform in the 1940s was crushed, and then a disputed election in
1951 (where the MNR won but was prevented from taking power) set off a popular uprising. In April 1952,
miners and workers armed themselves and, together with defecting army units, defeated the military. The
MNR took power and implemented a sweeping agenda: universal suffrage  (for the first time, indigenous
people could vote), nationalization of the big tin mines (to give the state and miners more control over the
nation’s wealth), and  agrarian reform  that broke up the haciendas and distributed land to hundreds of
thousands of peasant families. This was essentially a transfer of economic agency to the masses: workers
were empowered (labor unions gained a strong role, and wages increased), and peasants became small
landowners rather than indentured laborers. A U.S. diplomat at the time described the transformation as
Bolivia’s “social revolution” akin to Mexico’s earlier revolution. Though the MNR government struggled with
economic instability and eventually veered to the right, the legacy of 1952 was enormous – an entire social
order was overturned in favor of the previously marginalized.
Fast  forward  to  the  late  20th  century.  By  the  1980s-90s,  Bolivia  had  adopted  free-market  “neoliberal”
policies  under  pressure  from  international  lenders  to  combat  hyperinflation  and  stagnation.  State
industries were privatized, and foreign companies entered sectors like oil, gas, and even water services.
These  policies  initially  stabilized  the  economy  but  often  did  not  benefit  the  poor  majority,  and  they
sometimes undermined local control of resources . By the turn of the millennium, resentment had built up
again, especially among indigenous communities in the highlands and the coca-growing rural regions, who
felt excluded from economic decisions and harmed by privatization.
Two pivotal episodes – often called the  Water War (2000)  and the  Gas War (2003)  – showcased Bolivia’s
renewed fight for economic agency. In 2000, the government of President Hugo Banzer (a former dictator
turned  elected  president)  privatized  the  water  supply  of  Cochabamba,  Bolivia’s  third-largest  city.  A
consortium  led  by  a  subsidiary  of  the  U.S.  corporation  Bechtel  took  over  and,  in  order  to  finance
improvements and guarantee profits,  dramatically raised water rates  for consumers . This meant
some of the poorest families were asked to pay 20% or more of their income just for water – a resource that
had previously been subsidized or accessed through community systems. The outrage was immediate.
Grassroots groups formed a coalition (Coordinadora) uniting  engine drivers, farmers, urban laborers,
and even middle-class people  – everyone was affected by the prospect of exorbitant water bills. Starting in
January 2000, massive protests and strikes erupted in Cochabamba. Demonstrators waved banners with
slogans like “Water is Ours, Damn Yankees Out,” framing the issue as both economic (affordability of water)
and a matter of sovereignty (foreign corporate control). The government cracked down, even declaring
martial law, and several protesters were shot dead by security forces . But the protesters would not
relent; the entire city was essentially shut down by general strikes and road blockades. After months of
standoff, in April 2000 the Bolivian government canceled the water privatization  – a stunning victory for
people power . The  Cochabamba Water War  became an international symbol. Environmental and social
justice scholars noted that communal groups in Cochabamba “formed wider networks” and effectively
protested the privatized system and its high prices by mobilizing around the “fundamental right to water
and life” . In other words, they reframed water access as a basic human right, not a commodity to be
sold for profit. They regained their agency over a life-sustaining resource. This episode deeply influenced61

movements worldwide against the privatization of public goods. For Bolivia, it galvanized indigenous and
popular organizations with a sense of their power when united.
Only a few years later , Bolivia faced another confrontation – the Gas War of 2003 . Bolivia has substantial
natural gas reserves, and foreign companies were involved in extraction. President Gonzalo “Goni” Sánchez
de Lozada proposed a project to export gas via a pipeline through Chile to North America. Many Bolivians
reacted fiercely against this plan. Part of it was longstanding resentment against Chile (Bolivia lost its
coastline to Chile in a 19th-century war , and the idea of shipping gas out through Chile stirred nationalist
anger). But more fundamentally, people questioned why Bolivia, one of the poorest countries, should
export gas to enrich multinationals and neighbors while many Bolivian villages lacked electricity or gas.
They  demanded  that  Bolivia  industrialize  its  gas  or  use  it  domestically  first ,  and  that  the  state
renegotiate contracts with foreign firms for a better share of profits. In September–October 2003, protests
spearheaded by indigenous Aymara communities around El Alto (the giant poor city above La Paz) and
labor unions erupted. Roads to La Paz were blocked, cutting off fuel and supplies to the capital. Protesters
essentially besieged the city, chanting that Bolivia’s natural gas belonged to the Bolivian people. President
Sánchez de Lozada ordered a military crackdown, and a bloody confrontation ensued in which soldiers shot
dozens of protesters – including bystanders, women, and children – in what is known as the “Black October”
massacre.  This  only  inflamed  the  outrage.  As  violence  escalated  and  even  some  of  his  political  allies
defected, Sánchez de Lozada lost all legitimacy. On October 17, 2003, he resigned and fled the country
.  The  Guardian  reported  at  the  time:  “Bolivia’s  embattled  president,  Gonzalo  Sánchez  de  Lozada,
resigned… after a month of bloody street protests which claimed up to 80 lives. The huge popular uprising
was fueled by widespread fury over austerity plans… and government plans to sell off natural gas” . That
succinctly captures it: fury over austerity (economic disempowerment) and selling off resources (loss of
national  economic  agency)  caused  a  popular  uprising  that  toppled  the  government .  The  vice
president, Carlos Mesa, took over and in 2004 held a referendum that ultimately led to increasing the state’s
share of gas profits. But Mesa too faced continued protests and resigned in 2005, unable to navigate the
turbulent politics.
The Gas War protests marked a turning point that led to the election of Evo Morales  in December 2005,
Bolivia’s first indigenous president and a former coca growers’ union leader who had been prominent in the
protests.  Morales  ran  on  a  platform  of  “nationalizing”  Bolivia’s  gas  (and  other  resources)  and
empowering  the  indigenous  poor .  Upon  winning,  he  did  indeed  renegotiate  gas  contracts,  increasing
Bolivia’s revenue, and used the funds for social programs. He also convened a constituent assembly that
wrote a new constitution in 2009, which granted more autonomy and rights to indigenous communities and
declared water, healthcare, and education to be fundamental human rights . In essence, the political
mobilization of 2000–2005 in Bolivia led to a  democratic revolution by ballot , reversing many neoliberal
policies and reasserting public control over the economy. It was largely peaceful (aside from the violent
episodes under the prior government) and showed that political willpower can manifest not only in riots or
coups but also in sustained electoral change when the populace is organized . Importantly, Morales’ rise was the
direct result of years of grassroots struggle – the same unions and indigenous federations that fought in
the Water and Gas Wars formed his political base.
Bolivia’s story highlights how a population that feels its  economic agency is undermined by foreign or
elite interests  can organize to reclaim that agency. The slogans from Cochabamba – “ ¡El agua es nuestra,
carajo! ” (“The water is ours, damn it!”) – and from the Gas War – “ El gas para los Bolivianos ” (“Gas for the
Bolivians”) – encapsulate the demand that the wealth of the country and the essentials of life be controlled64

by and benefit the people themselves. It’s a cry against exclusion and a call for sovereignty at both the
national and community level. 
Venezuela: Boom, Bust, and Upheaval
Few nations illustrate the rollercoaster of economic agency and political consequence more vividly than
Venezuela . Blessed with the world’s largest oil reserves, Venezuela had periods of great wealth – but also
extreme inequality and, in recent years, an almost total economic collapse that has led to humanitarian
crisis and political standoff.
In the mid-20th century, Venezuela was relatively democratic and prosperous, buoyed by oil exports. But
wealth was concentrated; slums ringed Caracas while elites enjoyed petrodollar luxuries. Corruption was
endemic. In the 1980s, falling oil prices and debt led Venezuela to adopt austerity and neoliberal reforms.
Discontent exploded in 1989 with the Caracazo , a massive urban riot triggered by an IMF-recommended
package that included  hiking fuel prices and transit fares . Overnight, the cost of a bus ride doubled,
hitting  the  poor  hard.  Protests  and  looting  erupted  in  Caracas  and  other  cities.  The  government  of
President  Carlos  Andrés  Pérez  imposed  martial  law  and  unleashed  security  forces;  hundreds,  possibly
thousands, of civilians were killed in the ensuing days . The Caracazo was a societal shock – it shattered
the veneer of stability and showed the depth of anger in the populace. Among those impacted was a
paratrooper officer named Hugo Chávez , who saw the state’s brutality and the people’s misery and became
convinced that change was needed. He led a failed coup in 1992, was jailed, then later released and formed
a political movement.
By the late 1990s, Venezuela’s established political parties had lost credibility. Poverty was high, oil profits
seemed to vanish into graft, and people were desperate for new leadership. In 1998, Hugo Chávez won the
presidency on a fiery anti-establishment, anti-poverty platform. He promised a “Bolivarian Revolution” to
empower the poor majority – through redistributing oil wealth, creating social programs (health clinics,
education, food subsidies), and involving people in participatory local democracy. Chávez’s ascent was
essentially  the  ballot-box  answer  to  years  of  economic  disempowerment .  As  a  Council  on  Foreign
Relations timeline notes, Venezuelans in the 1990s were “fed up with economic uncertainty and consistent
decline,” which provided the backdrop for Chávez’s election . Indeed, an earlier era of neoliberal policies
had  seen  per  capita  income  decline  and  poverty  worsen,  eroding  faith  in  the  old  leaders.  Chávez
immediately called a constituent assembly to write a new constitution (ratified in 1999) that enshrined new
social rights and gave the state more control over oil.
In  the  2000s,  during  Chávez’s  tenure,  oil  prices  rose  dramatically,  providing  funds  for  his  ambitious
“Bolivarian  Missions”  –  literacy  campaigns,  housing  projects,  direct  cash  transfers,  etc.  Early  on,  these
policies reduced poverty and improved literacy and health  indicators, garnering Chávez fervent support
among the poor . However , critics charged that he also weakened checks and balances, politicized the state
oil company, and spent beyond sustainable limits. He also antagonized the domestic elite and the U.S.
government (surviving a short-lived coup attempt in 2002 and a damaging oil strike in 2003). Nonetheless,
Chávez was reelected multiple times (in votes generally deemed free, especially early on) and became a
symbol of anti-imperialism and social justice for supporters. From an economic agency perspective, his rule
initially seemed to expand it – giving marginalized people access to resources and a say through communal
councils.66
67
19
Tragically,  underlying  structural  issues  and  policy  missteps  eventually  unraveled  Venezuela’s  economy,
especially after Chávez’s death in 2013 and under his successor Nicolás Maduro. By the mid-2010s, a
combination of plunging oil prices, years of mismanagement, corruption, and U.S. sanctions  created an
economic  implosion.  Inflation  skyrocketed  to  the  point  of  hyperinflation  (prices  rising  by  millions  of
percent), effectively destroying the currency’s value . The economy contracted by over 50% between
2013 and 2019 – a depression deeper than the U.S. Great Depression. This led to severe shortages of basic
goods : food, medicine, electricity, water . By 2019, roughly 90% of Venezuelans were living in poverty, and
more than 5 million had fled the country as refugees or migrants. This dire state clearly represented a
catastrophic  loss  of  economic  agency  for  Venezuelan  citizens.  People  with  college  degrees  were
scavenging for food or trading goods informally just to survive; the middle class was utterly wiped out;
children suffered malnutrition in what had been one of Latin America’s richest societies. It is a textbook case
of how quickly political support evaporates when living standards collapse .
Predictably, this sparked intense political conflict. The opposition to Maduro won control of the legislature
in 2015, as the public vented their anger at the ballot box. In 2017, after the government tried to bypass the
legislature and crack down on protests, massive demonstrations rocked Venezuela; security forces and pro-
government  militias  responded  violently,  resulting  in  deaths.  In  early  2019,  the  head  of  the  National
Assembly, Juan Guaidó, citing constitutional provisions, declared Maduro’s 2018 re-election invalid and
himself interim president, gaining recognition from the U.S. and dozens of other countries. This standoff
(Maduro remained in control of the military and territory) reflected the extreme polarization fueled by the
crisis.
A BBC report from February 2019 encapsulated the situation: “Growing discontent in Venezuela, fueled by
hyperinflation, power cuts and food and medicine shortages , has led to a political crisis” . Indeed, it
was precisely the inability to obtain basic essentials  that drove even once-loyal chavistas into the streets or
at least into frustration. The same report noted that Guaidó’s challenge emerged “following large protests”
and that at least 40 people died in unrest in January 2019 . So we see that when a population’s everyday
survival is threatened,  political stability disintegrates . People will protest even if it means risking state
repression, because the status quo becomes literally unbearable. Venezuelans by the late 2010s frequently
said they protested because they had “no food,” “no medicines,” “no future.” A potent slogan was “Tenemos
hambre” – “We are hungry.”
It is worth noting that Venezuela’s turmoil also had international dimensions (geopolitical rivalry, sanctions)
that complicated resolution. But at its heart was the feedback loop of a failed economic model breeding
desperation and thus a surge in political will to seek change  at any cost. Sadly, unlike in Bolivia 15 years
earlier , in Venezuela the struggle did not yield a clear positive outcome by 2020 – it resulted in a protracted
stalemate and humanitarian disaster . This underscores that while economic misery virtually guarantees
political turmoil, that turmoil does not always resolve in a quick or constructive way. Sometimes it leads to
factional  conflict,  state  fragmentation,  or  even  civil  war .  Venezuela  skirted  civil  war ,  but  it  slid  into
authoritarian practices as Maduro clung to power , arguably to avoid accountability and to maintain some
semblance of order amid chaos.
Still, the case reaffirms the core thesis:  people will not remain passive when their economic world
collapses . Either through elections, protests, or other means, they will assert their collective will, for better
or worse. In Venezuela’s case, years of declining economic agency – first gradually, then suddenly – led to
an explosive demand for regime change, a demand so strong that an opposition leader proclaimed a
parallel government. By essentially all measures of economic data (hyperinflation above 1,000,000% ,68
69
70

GDP halved, poverty over 90%), Venezuelans had lost control over their livelihoods. And thus they rose up,
only to encounter a regime equally determined to survive. The resulting impasse is still unresolved, but the
pattern up to the brink is clear as day.
Conclusion: The Enduring Cycle of Disempowerment and Dissent
Across this sweeping journey – from the streets of Paris in 1789 to the plazas of the Arab world in 2011 – we
have seen a recurring dynamic.  When economic agency erodes – when people feel locked out of the
decisions and rewards that shape their lives – the pressure builds for political action.  Sometimes it
bursts  forth  in  the  form  of  revolutions  that  remake  constitutions  and  social  contracts;  other  times  in
destructive conflicts or the rise of demagogues; and at times in more peaceful (if still contentious) waves of
reform.  The  specific  contexts  differ ,  but  the  feedback  loop  connecting  economic  disempowerment  to
political mobilization is a constant undercurrent in history.
Major  economic  thinkers  help  illuminate  aspects  of  this  phenomenon.  Marx  provided  the  clearest
articulation: an exploited class will eventually fight to overthrow a system that denies them the fruits of
their labor . Polanyi observed that society will protect itself against a market that “annihilates” the fabric
of social life  – essentially, people push back via politics to reclaim security and dignity. Hayek and
Friedman, on the other hand, warned that constricting economic freedom through top-down control invites
tyranny or backlash . In a sense, they were describing the inverse: if a government arbitrarily takes
away property or choice, people may rebel to restore their autonomy (consider the Eastern Bloc revolts
against communist regimes in 1953, 1956, 1968, 1980–81, and finally 1989 – largely uprisings to gain both
political and economic freedom from an overbearing state). The truth is that both extremes – a laissez-faire
market without safety nets, or an over-centralized command economy – can disempower individuals in
different ways, and both can provoke upheaval . That is why Friedman noted the relationship is not one-
directional but “complex and by no means unilateral” . The stable societies tend to be those that strike a
balance, giving citizens enough voice and security to believe change can happen within the system rather
than by overthrowing it.
History also teaches that the perception  of agency matters greatly. It’s not only absolute poverty that incites
revolts – it’s often relative deprivation or sudden loss. French peasants in 1789 had endured hardship for
centuries, but the immediate spike in bread prices  combined with Enlightenment ideals of equality
made the old burdens newly intolerable. Russian workers in 1917 were triggered by acute war privations on
top of long-standing autocracy . Middle Eastern youths in 2011 were often educated but unemployed
and fed up with corrupt gerontocracies, a classic case of expectations frustrated . In each scenario,
there is a sense that things could and should be better  – that those in power have failed or betrayed the social
contract.
We have seen revolutions (American, French, Russian, Iranian), civil wars and violent rebellions (Taiping, the
various uprisings around World War I), regime changes via protest or coup (Haiti 1791–1804, the fall of the
Soviet bloc in 1989–91, the Arab Spring ousters of dictators), and major reforms (New Deal, decolonization
and land reforms, etc.) all emerge from the seed of economic discontent. Even in the 21st century, as recent
events like the Arab Spring  show, the pattern persists: as one analysis put it, those uprisings were “more a
function  of  gross  economic  mismanagement  and  brutal  political  centralization”  than  anything  else  –
massive  unemployment  and  inequality  “galvanizing  the  Arab  street  to  attempt  to  redraw  the  political
landscape” . The self-immolation of a fruit seller in Tunisia (Mohamed Bouazizi in 2010) became the2

spark for regional revolt precisely because it symbolized the humiliation of economic marginalization under
an unresponsive regime. 
Not every instance of economic pain results in revolution, of course. Much depends on how elites and
institutions respond. In some cases, timely concessions or reforms can channel anger constructively. For
example, Britain’s extension of the franchise in the 19th century and post-World War II welfare state likely
helped it avoid the kind of revolutions that befell other nations. The U.S. Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s,
while primarily about racial justice, also had an economic dimension; the War on Poverty and civil rights
legislation addressed some grievances that might have otherwise boiled over even more. Conversely, when
rulers double down on repression instead of relief – as the Qing did initially in China, or as Syria’s Assad did
in 2011 – they often end up fueling a far worse eruption, sometimes at horrific cost.
A final observation is the cyclical nature of this feedback loop. After a period of upheaval and change,
societies might enter a more stable or prosperous phase. But over time, new inequalities or problems can
emerge, starting the cycle anew. The gains of one revolution can be eroded, requiring renewal by later
generations.  The  complex  feedback  loop  between  economic  disempowerment  and  political
mobilization is thus ongoing . It is not a single revolution or reform that “solves” it, but a continual
balancing act. As economies evolve (through industrialization, globalization, technological change), new
forms of dislocation appear – and with them, new calls for inclusion. Consider how the late 20th century’s
globalization and automation have, in some countries, hollowed out middle-class jobs, contributing to the
rise of populist movements in recent years (though beyond the scope of our pre-2020 focus, one could
mention how economic grievances in the American Rust Belt or Britain’s deindustrialized north fed into
phenomena like Trumpism or Brexit – peaceful political shifts, but disruptive nonetheless).
In closing, we return to the human element that underlies all these grand events. Whether it was a Parisian
mother in 1789 crying that her children had no bread, a Russian soldier in 1917 throwing down his rifle to
join a bread march, a Bolivian villager in 2000 demanding affordable water , or a young Tunisian in 2010 with
a college degree and no job – the cry is fundamentally the same:  we deserve a say in our own economic
destiny . When enough people share that feeling and existing structures block them from fulfillment, history
tends to shift under their feet. Governments are wise to heed those cries and adapt before explosions occur .
But when they do not, the governed will ultimately take their rightful place as active agents  of change –
sometimes messy, sometimes marvelous, always momentous.
The  pattern  is  perhaps  best  summed  up  by  a  simple  truth:  people  will  tolerate  hardship,  but  not
powerlessness.  If hardship comes, they will seek power to change it. And if denied that power for too long,
they will seize it in the streets, in the fields, at the ballot box, or on the barricades. This narrative has shown
that  time  and  again,  declining  economic  agency  has  led  ordinary  men  and  women  –  often  with
extraordinary courage – to rise up and remake the political order , pushing the arc of history, inch by inch,
toward a world where everyone can earn a dignified living and have a voice in their collective fate. Each
chapter – from the Declaration of the Rights of Man to the cries of “Pan, trabajo y libertad” (“Bread, work,
and freedom”) in more recent protests – adds to that long story of the fight for economic agency and the
world it continues to shape.
