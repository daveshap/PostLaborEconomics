Towards an Economic Agency Index: Income
Composition in a Post-Neoliberal Era
Introduction
In the evolving landscape of post-neoliberal economics, traditional indicators often fail to capture  how
households derive their income . This report proposes an  Economic Agency Index  for OECD countries
(with a focus on the U.S.) that breaks down household income into three sources: wage earnings, property
income,  and  government  transfers .  These  three  components  –  labor ,  capital,  and  public  support  –
collectively form the basis of aggregate demand in an economy. By monitoring the triadic composition of
income, policymakers and analysts can gain insight into structural shifts in economic power and well-being
that are obscured by one-dimensional metrics like GDP or the unemployment rate . In essence, the index
illuminates who has economic agency (through wages or assets) and who relies on collective support,
offering a diagnostic tool for an era in which wage labor’s dominance is waning.
The sections that follow review existing related indicators, justify the need for this new composite measure
in the context of automation and capital concentration, outline a methodology for its implementation,
discuss what the index reveals about economic dependency and autonomy, and explore policy levers to
change a country’s income composition. The goal is a comprehensive understanding of how an Economic
Agency Index could fill a critical information gap in post-labor economies.
Existing Indicators and Precedents
While no current indicator directly measures the  three-way composition  of household income, several
existing metrics capture pieces of this concept or share a similar intent: 
Functional Income Distribution (Labor vs. Capital Shares):  Macroeconomic statistics often track
the share of national income going to labor (wages) versus capital (profits, interest, and rents). For
example, many OECD countries have seen a modest but significant decline in the labor share of GDP
over recent decades . This reflects the broad shift of income from wages toward capital. However ,
such measures typically operate at the national accounts level and  omit government transfers .
They tell us how output is split between labor and capital but not how much households depend on
state support or non-market income. 
Household  Main  Income  Source  Classification:  Statistical  agencies  sometimes  categorize
households by their predominant income source. An OECD expert group, for instance, classified
households into those mainly living on wages, self-employment, property income, or government
transfers . This approach (used in distributional national accounts) recognizes the same triad of
income sources. It provides valuable snapshots (e.g. identifying the share of households primarily
reliant on transfers versus wages), but it is a categorical grouping  rather than a continuous index. It1

doesn’t quantify the overall composition of income at the national level, nor track changes over time
in a single measure.
Gini Coefficient Decomposition by Income Source:  In inequality research, analysts decompose the
Gini index to see how different income sources contribute to overall inequality . Such studies
treat  wages,  capital  income,  and  transfers  as  components  and  evaluate,  for  example,  whether
transfers reduce inequality or property income exacerbates it. This technique reveals that  capital
income tends to be far more unequally distributed  than labor income – for instance, global data
show the Gini coefficient for capital income (~85 Gini points) is much higher than that for labor
income (~73 points) . While informative, this is focused on inequality impact rather than the raw
shares of income sources. It tells us the effect on income distribution, but not the simple breakdown
of aggregate income into wages, assets, and transfers.
Luxembourg  Income  Study  (LIS)  Data  Structures:  Cross-national  microdata  projects  like  LIS
provide standardized income components for households (e.g. wages, self-employment earnings,
investment income, pensions, social transfers). Researchers can use these to calculate the average
composition of disposable income in each country. Indeed, LIS defines “labor income” in a broad
sense (often including wages, self-employment, and sometimes even private transfers) and “capital
income”  (interest,  dividends,  rental  income) .  However ,  no  single  LIS  indicator  routinely
published distills this into an easy-to-read index for policymakers. One must extract and compute it
from microdata, meaning the concept has not yet been popularized as a headline metric.
In summary, current tools either  simplify income into two categories (labor vs capital)  or  focus on
inequality and household types . None provides a straightforward, regularly reported triadic breakdown
of income sources with diagnostic interpretation . The proposed Economic Agency Index fills this gap by
directly measuring the proportion of income that households derive from wages, property, and transfers,
and framing the result as an indicator of structural economic conditions. It builds on the above precedents
but goes further in scope and purpose: not just to dissect inequality or classify households, but to serve as a
barometer of the economic model  (wage-led, capital-led, or transfer-sustained) for each country.
Rationale in a Post-Labor Economic Context
Why is this new measurement needed? The justification lies in profound changes underway in advanced
economies.  In  a  “post-labor”  context ,  characterized  by  accelerating  automation  and  concentration  of
capital ownership, wage labor is losing its once-central role in distributing income . Yet our metrics
have not caught up – we lack a clear view of how households are sustaining their purchasing power as
these shifts occur . Several trends underscore the importance of tracking income composition now:
Declining Dominance of Wages:  In the mid-20th century, most households earned their livelihood
primarily through work (the classic industrial era norm). Today, that norm is eroding. Across many
OECD countries, the labor share of national income has trended downward since the 1980s .
Technology-driven productivity allows output to grow even as total wages stagnate, and corporate
profits (a proxy for property income) claim a larger slice of the pie. Automation, AI, and robotics are
anticipated to further reduce the demand for human labor in many sectors . As wage income
growth slows or even reverses for the working class, alternative income streams must fill the gap
to maintain aggregate demand.•

Rising Capital Concentration and Unearned Income:  Wealth has become more concentrated in
recent decades, which means property income (dividends, interest, rents) accrues to a relatively
small segment of the population. For example, in the United States the  bottom 50% of households
own only about 2% of the nation’s wealth , implying that half the population receives negligible
capital income. The top 10% owns the vast majority of financial assets, and thus captures most
dividend and interest income . As capital ownership concentrates, a larger share of national
income is paid out as property income (profits, interest, etc.), but  those payments go to fewer
people . This raises concerns about under-consumption: high-income rentiers tend to save a larger
fraction of income, whereas wage earners and transfer recipients generally spend more of it. Indeed,
economic studies confirm that less wealthy households have a much higher marginal propensity to
consume than the rich . A society that funnels more income to capital owners thus risks weaker
consumer  demand  –  unless  redistribution  or  other  channels  re-inject  purchasing  power  to  the
broader population. The Economic Agency Index would make such shifts visible by tracking the
share of total income coming from property returns versus work and public support.
Growth of Government Transfers:  In many advanced economies, the welfare state has expanded
(or at least remained substantial), especially as populations age. Pensions, unemployment benefits,
healthcare reimbursements, and other transfers now account for a significant portion of household
incomes.  Notably,  in  the  U.S.,  government  transfers’  share  of  personal  income  more  than
doubled  from  8.2%  in  1970  to  17.6%  in  2022 .  This  reflects  programs  like  Social  Security,
Medicare, and income support becoming increasingly important to sustain households – trends seen
even  before  the  pandemic,  and  sharply  amplified  during  crises  (e.g.,  COVID-19  relief  in  2020
temporarily pushed transfers to over 20% of U.S. income) . Similar patterns are observed in many
OECD  countries  with  robust  social  safety  nets  or  aging  demographics.  As  wage  growth
underperforms and capital income is unevenly distributed , public transfers have often stepped
in to support aggregate demand. However , heavy reliance on transfers can signal structural issues:
an economy where private market incomes are not sufficient for large groups (whether due to
unemployment, low wages, or retirement). Without an index, it’s hard to quantify this reliance or
identify when a country’s demand is propped up by fiscal redistribution as opposed to labor or
capital earnings.
Post-Neoliberal  Priorities  –  Equity  and  Agency:  In  the  post-neoliberal  discourse,  there  is  a
renewed focus on economic  agency , power , and equity rather than just growth-at-all-costs. The
neoliberal era tended to assume wages from a job would be the default source of livelihood, with
minimal state interference. Post-neoliberal economics, by contrast, is open to larger roles for the
state and alternative ownership structures . It questions the “naturalness” of market distributions
and  emphasizes  outcomes  like  security  and  autonomy.  Within  this  paradigm,  measuring  what
portion of income people get from labor vs. capital vs. social support  is intrinsically valuable. It shines
light on power imbalances : e.g. how many people have independent asset income (and thus a form
of economic autonomy) versus how many depend entirely on an employer or government programs.
It also exposes  structural dependencies : a country where most income comes through wages
might signal strong labor inclusion – or conversely, it might mask exploitation if wages are very low.
A country where transfers are high might indicate either a well-functioning social safety net or an
economy unable to generate enough jobs. These nuances are crucial in post-neoliberal analysis. In
short,  as  one  scholar  put  it,  a  “post-labor  economy  requires  rethinking  conventional  economic
indicators” and developing new ones that capture well-being and autonomy beyond the old metrics•

. The Economic Agency Index is precisely such an indicator , reflecting the balance between
market earnings, public support, and capital income in people’s lives.
In sum, the changing realities of automation, inequality, and welfare provision create a diagnostic gap  in
our current toolkit. The Economic Agency Index addresses that gap by providing a clear , trackable measure
of how the foundation of aggregate demand is composed. It helps answer: Are we moving toward a rentier
society?  A  welfare-dependent  society?  Or  a  high-wage,  broad  prosperity  society?  These  questions  are
central to post-neoliberal economic strategy, and cannot be answered by existing aggregates alone. The
new index thus aligns with and reinforces modern economic thinking that looks beyond GDP to the quality
and structure of income.
Proposed Index Structure and Methodology
Constructing the Economic Agency Index involves defining its components rigorously and choosing data
sources that ensure comparability across countries and over time . The index is essentially a triplet (or a
set of three sub-indices) representing the share of household income derived from: (1) Labor (wages and
related earnings), (2) Capital (property income), and (3) Government Transfers . Key considerations for
implementation include data definitions, frequency, and granularity:
Data Definitions (Income Components):  For consistency, the following definitions are
recommended:
Wage/Labor Income:  All earnings from work including wages, salaries, and cash employment
benefits. Ideally, this also includes self-employment and small business income , which are labor-
driven even if classified as mixed income in national accounts. (In practice, self-employment income
can be split into labor vs. capital components if data permit, but for simplicity it may be grouped
with labor income, since it is the person’s own work generating the income.) This corresponds to the
sum of “compensation of employees” and labor portion of mixed income in national accounts . It 
excludes  pension benefits or any passive income.
Property/Capital Income:  Income from ownership of assets – this covers dividends from stocks,
interest from bonds and savings, rental income from real estate, and any other investment returns.
In national accounts terms, it is “net property income received by households” (net of property
income paid, like interest on loans) . Notably, capital gains  are typically excluded (since they
are not part of income flows), and imputed rent  (the value homeowners “pay” to themselves) may be
excluded or handled separately to focus on cash flows. The aim is to capture cash or in-kind inflows
that come by virtue of owning assets  rather than working. 
Government Transfers:  All current transfers from the government that augment household income,
for which the household provides no direct service in return. This includes social safety net payments
(unemployment benefits, food assistance, welfare), public pensions, and other cash benefits, as well
as near-cash benefits. It can also include free or subsidized services (“social transfers in kind”) if one
wants a broader measure of state support, though the core index would likely stick to  monetary
transfers  to  remain  comparable  to  income .  We  would  exclude  private  transfers  (like
remittances or family support) and only count government or social insurance schemes. Taxes paid
are not an “income source” but rather deductions; thus the composition is best calculated using
disposable income  (after direct taxes and social contributions, and including cash transfers) as the
denominator . Each component then is measured  net of taxes  where applicable (e.g., a pension
counted is the net benefit received).1

Calculation:  For each country and year (or quarter), compute:
Wage share  = (Household labor earnings) / (Household disposable income) × 100%
Property income share  = (Household capital income received) / (Household disposable income) ×
100%
Transfer share  = (Household government transfers received) / (Household disposable income) ×
100%
These three shares ideally sum to 100% of household disposable income (minor discrepancies can
arise if there are other small income items or if using net measures). In the U.S. for example, using
2022  data:  wages  and  proprietors’  earnings  made  up  roughly  ~62%  of  total  personal  income,
property income ~20%, and government transfers ~18% . In a different system like France or
Sweden, one might find a lower property share and higher transfer share due to stronger welfare
states,  or  vice  versa.  The  index  would  report  all  three  percentages,  giving  a  snapshot  of  the
economy’s income structure. For ease of communication, one could also combine the wage and
transfer  shares  that  go  predominantly  to  the  non-rich,  versus  the  property  share  that  is
concentrated – but it is most illuminating to keep the triad separate.
Data Sources:  To implement this index robustly:
OECD and National Accounts:  The OECD already compiles national accounts data including
household sector income and its components. Key sources include the OECD Income Distribution
Database  (for survey-based measures of disposable income) and national accounts (for aggregate
compensation of employees, property income flows, and transfers). National statistical agencies (like
the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis) publish personal income breakdowns  that can be utilized.
For example, the U.S. BEA provides monthly and annual data on personal income by source – wages
and salaries, business owners’ income, dividends, interest, rent, and government social benefits .
These can be mapped to the index categories. Similarly, European countries report income
components in their national accounts (often quarterly) that could feed into a quarterly or annual
index update.
Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) and Microdata:  For deeper analysis and cross-checking, LIS or
similar micro-surveys can be used to validate the composition, especially to ensure consistency in
definitions (e.g. what counts as transfer). Microdata also allow calculation of the index within
subpopulations  (by income quintile, age group, etc., if needed for diagnostic purposes). While the
headline index would rely on aggregate totals, having the microdata backing helps address
questions like distribution within the property income share (since a high property share might
mostly accrue to the top 5%).
Administrative Data:  In some cases, administrative records (tax data on dividends/interest, social
security data on benefits, etc.) can improve accuracy. For instance, governments know precisely how
much they paid in transfers each year , and central banks often know interest and dividend flows.
These can supplement or refine the household survey and national accounts figures.
Frequency and Updates:  The index should be updated  annually  at minimum, since many of its
inputs (like detailed household income composition) are annual. Ideally, a high-level version could be
updated  quarterly  using  national  accounts  (which  have  quarterly  data  for  wages,  aggregate
transfers, etc.). For example, the wage and property components of personal income are available
quarterly  for  many  countries,  and  government  transfer  outlays  are  known  quarterly  as  well.  A•

quarterly index could give a timely read, with an annual more precise revision. However , to keep
things simple and comparable across all OECD members, an annual index  (released perhaps with a
one-year lag due to data processing) would be most straightforward. Over time, this produces a time
series per country of the three shares, showing trends.
Geographic and Demographic Granularity:  Initially, the index is designed at the national level , as
a macro indicator . However , methodology could allow further breakdown:
By subnational region (if data on income by source is available regionally; e.g., one might compare
states or provinces, though this is more feasible in large countries with rich data like the U.S. or
Canada).
By population subgroup (for diagnostic purposes, not as the headline number): e.g., one could
compute the triad for the bottom income quintile vs. the top quintile to see stark differences in
composition. Often, lower-income households get a larger share of income from transfers, whereas
high-income households get more from property. This isn’t part of the single index, but an extension
for analysis.
By age cohort: a young population might rely more on wages, whereas an older one on pensions
(transfers) and investments. Again, this provides context to interpret the national figure.
Normalization and Units:  To compare across countries, all values should be in local currency and
then converted to shares of total household disposable income . Using shares (% of total) inherently
normalizes  for  country  size,  currency,  and  inflation  differences.  It  focuses  on  composition,  not
absolute levels. For longitudinal analysis, one may also look at per capita amounts (e.g. dollars per
person from wages vs. transfers) indexed over time, but the primary index is ratio-based. If needed,
one could scale the shares into an index number  (for example, assign 100 points divided among the
three  components  or  create  a  composite  score),  but  that  may  obscure  information.  It’s  more
transparent to present the three percentages together . A visual format could be a stacked bar or
triangle graph each year . For instance, a table might show:
Country (Year) Wage Income % Property Income % Government Transfers %
United States (2022) ~62% ~20% ~18%
Germany (2022)* 55% 15% 30%
Sweden (2022)* Fifty-some % <15% >30%
(*Hypothetical figures for illustration.) 
Such a presentation makes clear at a glance how different economies are structured – e.g. the U.S. relying
relatively more on market earnings and capital, while a country like Sweden has a larger role for transfers
(due to its extensive welfare state).
Historical and Future Expansion:  We should compute the index historically (where data allows) to
establish baseline trends. Many components can be traced back decades. For example, U.S. national
accounts can provide the shares since mid-20th century, aligning with known trends (the transfer
share rising over time, etc. ). For other OECD members, at least post-1990 data is usually•

available. Going forward, the index could also be extended beyond OECD if harmonized data are
obtainable (the LIS database or World Bank could help include some emerging economies for
comparison).
By following this methodology, the Economic Agency Index would be robust, repeatable, and comparable .
It leverages existing high-quality data (national accounts, LIS, OECD stats) and repackages them in a new,
policy-relevant  format.  The  index’s  integrity  will  depend  on  careful  handling  of  definitions  (ensuring
“transfers” mean the same in each country, etc.) and transparency in what’s included. For instance, one
should document whether public old-age pensions are counted as transfers (typically yes, as they are
government-paid benefits), and whether employer-paid benefits are counted in wages (yes, as part of
compensation). As long as such choices are consistent, the index will meaningfully reflect each country’s
economic structure.
Interpreting the Economic Agency Index: Diagnostic Insights
The true value of the Economic Agency Index lies in  what it can tell us about a country’s economic
organization  and  potential  vulnerabilities .  Each  component  of  the  triad  –  high  or  low  –  carries
interpretation about dependency, autonomy, and structural features. Below, we discuss what different
index profiles might indicate and how to read the index diagnostically:
High Wage Share Polity:  If a country’s index shows an exceptionally high proportion of income from
wages  (and  self-employment)  –  say  75%  or  more  –  it  means  that  household  demand  is
overwhelmingly driven by labor markets. On face value, this could indicate a strong employment
situation with broad participation. It suggests economic agency via labor : people’s livelihood is tied to
jobs. For example, a younger developing OECD country might have this profile if welfare systems are
small and capital markets underdeveloped. However , a  very high reliance on wages can also
signify vulnerability . It may mean inadequate social safety nets (so even those not working have to
rely on family wages) or a lack of asset ownership among the middle class. In such a scenario, if
automation  or  recession  hits  jobs,  households  have  little  cushion  from  either  investments  or
government support. A wage-heavy index also raises questions of labor precarity : are these secure,
well-paying jobs or unstable gigs? The index won’t answer that directly, but it flags the need to
consider how resilient an economy is when work is the main source of income for most people.
High Property Income Share Polity:  A country with a large property income share (relative to OECD
peers) suggests that a significant slice of purchasing power comes from owning capital. This is
typical  in  economies  where  wealth  inequality  is  high  and  financial  markets  are  prominent.  For
instance, if the top 10% or retirees receive substantial dividends, interest, and rental income, the
national  property  share  will  be  elevated.  Such  a  profile  indicates  a  potential  structural
asymmetry in economic agency:  those with capital have independent income streams (and thus
more autonomy from both work and state), while those without assets might be entirely dependent
on wages or transfers. A high property share can signal that economic power is concentrated  – the
wealthy not only hold assets but also command a larger portion of consumer demand through their
income, which can translate to political influence. It could also mean the economy is skewed towards
rentier activity , deriving income from past accumulations rather than productive new labor . From a
demand perspective, as noted, high property income societies risk under-consumption if wealth is
held by a few: affluent asset-owners tend to save more, so if too much income goes to them, total
consumption might falter . On the positive side, if property income is widely distributed (e.g. via• 
• 
12

broad stock ownership or pension funds), a high property share might indicate a form of collective
wealth – but in practice broad distribution is rare. So, diagnostically, one should ask:  Is the high
property share coming from a broad middle-class investor base or from a narrow elite?  Usually, it’s the
latter , which may call for policies to broaden capital ownership or mitigate the inequality that such an
index reading implies.
High Transfer Share Polity:  When government transfers constitute a large fraction of household
income, it points to a strong role of the state in sustaining living standards . Northern European
social  democracies  and  countries  with  expansive  welfare  programs  often  have  higher  transfer
shares, especially for the lower-income tiers. This can reflect positive attributes: low poverty, because
the state is redistributing income; an element of  decommodification , meaning people are less
forced to rely on the market for survival (the welfare state provides a social wage). For example, if a
country has universal basic income or generous pensions, the index’s transfer component will be
higher . However , a high transfer share also has cautionary interpretations. It could indicate an aging
population  (large  pension  outlays  relative  to  wages),  or  weak  labor  market  absorption  (many
working-age individuals needing unemployment or disability benefits). It might also signal regional
imbalances – e.g., some areas where government support is the primary income source due to
industrial  decline.  Politically,  a  high  transfer  dependency  could  lead  to  tension:  taxpayers  vs.
beneficiaries, or questions of program sustainability . EIG’s analysis of the U.S. noted that
rising  transfer  shares,  especially  in  rural  and  older  areas,  can  shift  political  preferences  and
budgetary  pressures .  In  diagnostic  terms,  one  should  consider  what  types  of  transfers
dominate : Is it mostly pensions (implying demographic effects)? Or income maintenance for the poor
(implying inequality and job shortfall)? The index by itself won’t specify that breakdown, but it directs
us to investigate the causes behind government support. Generally, if transfers are keeping a large
part of society afloat, it underscores  structural dependence on policy choices  – essentially, the
state is a major agent in purchasing power distribution. This can be a deliberate social choice (e.g.
social democratic model) or a sign of distress (e.g. post-crisis emergency measures).
Mixed or Balanced Profiles:  Many countries will have a balanced mix – e.g. around 60% wages, 20%
capital, 20% transfers. It is useful to compare peers: if one country has a notably higher transfer
share than another at similar income levels, it hints at different welfare models. If one has a higher
capital share, perhaps its wealth inequality or pension fund structure differs.  Changes over time  in
one country are especially telling. For instance, if we observe the U.S. index over decades: the wage
share has declined, transfer share risen , and capital share fluctuated with markets. A steady fall
in wage share coupled with a rise in either transfers or property share can mean that labor is being
supplanted  by  automation  or  offshoring  (if  property  share  rises)  or  that  public  intervention  is
compensating for labor’s decline (if transfers rise). Either way, it’s a signal of a post-labor transition
in progress. Similarly, if a country undertakes pension reforms or experiences asset booms, those
will appear as shifts in the composition.
In all, the Economic Agency Index serves as a diagnostic dashboard . A high wage share might highlight
vulnerability to technological unemployment; a high transfer share might highlight vulnerability to political
budget cuts (since if the government retrenches, incomes fall); a high property share might highlight
vulnerability to financial market downturns (since asset income can swing with stock prices or interest
rates). It also surfaces questions of autonomy and precarity : people living off investments may have more
economic independence (though possibly fewer people enjoy that), people living off transfers may feel
precariously dependent on political decisions, and people living off wages are exposed to labor market•

forces  and  employer  power .  None  of  these  income  sources  is  inherently  “bad”  or  “good”  –  but  their
proportions tell a story about where the center of gravity lies in an economy . Is it in private labor markets,
public  social  contracts,  or  private  capital?  That  structural  character  has  far-reaching  implications  for
everything from consumption patterns to power relations.
Finally, an important diagnostic use of the index is in identifying structural asymmetries . For example, a
country could have a relatively high overall wage share, but if property income is, say, 20% of total and
almost all of that goes to a tiny elite, the index alerts us to the presence of a kind of dual economy. Or
consider  a  scenario:  two  countries  both  have  15%  property  income  share;  if  in  one  country  half  of
households receive some property income, while in another only the top 5% do, the social implications
differ . The index would prompt analysts to dig deeper into such questions. Complementary data (like “share
of population with any capital income”, which globally was about 32% by 2016 up from 20% in 2000 ) can
be used alongside to gauge distribution. In sum, the index by reflecting dependency vs. autonomy  broadly
can illuminate whether an economy is moving towards a structure where, for instance, a few have full agency
through capital and the rest rely on public support , or one where broadly people have agency through work with
a safety net underneath , etc. This is the kind of high-level diagnostic insight needed for formulating post-
neoliberal economic strategies.
Policy Implications and Prescriptive Use
Beyond analysis, the Economic Agency Index has a prescriptive dimension: it can guide policymakers who
have normative goals about how income should be distributed by source. If a society decides, for example,
that  it  is  undesirable  to  have  most  of  the  population  entirely  dependent  on  wages  (as  jobs  become
precarious), or that expanding capital income for the non-rich is a priority, the index helps track progress
toward those goals. Below are some policy tools and structural levers to  shift the balance of income
sources , along with how they would register on the index:
1. Taxation and Redistribution:  The classic lever is the tax-and-transfer system. If the aim is to
increase the transfer share  (e.g. to support those left behind by the labor market), policies can expand
government benefits funded by progressive taxes. Higher taxes on high earners or wealth can
finance social transfers (UBI, child allowances, expanded unemployment benefits). This would raise
the transfers portion of income while reducing disposable income from property or even wages (via
taxes). Conversely, cutting taxes on labor income relative to capital income could modestly boost the
net  wage  share.  For  instance,  some  economists  argue  the  decline  in  U.S.  labor  share  was
exacerbated by shifts in taxation favoring capital . Restoring balance might involve taxing capital
gains, dividends, and large inheritances more, using revenue to bolster social insurance and wage
subsidies. The index provides a way to measure whether such fiscal policies are having the intended
effect (e.g. over a decade, did the transfer percentage rise? Did the after-tax capital share fall?).
2. Social Wealth Funds and Universal Capital Income:  One way to increase property income for
the bottom quintiles  is not by forcing them individually to invest, but by collectively investing on
their behalf. A Social Wealth Fund  is a public fund that owns a diversified portfolio of assets and
pays dividends to the population. For example, Norway has famously accumulated public wealth
equivalent to ~59% of the country’s private wealth, via its sovereign wealth funds . The returns
from these funds effectively provide a societal property income – in Norway’s case used to fund
public services and keep transfer payments generous . In the U.S., policy thinkers have proposed
a similar model: the federal government could create a fund, gradually socialize a portion of national22
•

wealth into it, and then pay out a universal basic dividend (UBD)  to every citizen . This would
appear in our index as an increase in the “property income” component but for everyone  (since the
dividend is technically investment income from the fund). Unlike traditional capital income which
only some households receive, a social dividend would be broadly distributed, thus democratizing
that slice of the pie. Alaska’s Permanent Fund Dividend (an annual payout to all residents from oil
investment revenues) is a real-world example: it has, in effect, given every Alaskan a small property
income. Policies in this vein would increase the property income share of national income  and
spread it widely, ideally improving economic agency for those without personal wealth. Over time, a
successful social wealth fund could noticeably lift the property share in the index while also reducing
inequality (something a pure rise in capital share usually fails to do).
3. Encouraging Broader Asset Ownership:  Another strategy to boost non-elite capital income is
through “pre-distribution”  – ensuring the ownership of assets is wider in the first place. This includes
policies like:
Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) and Profit-Sharing:  Encouraging or mandating that
workers own shares in the companies they work for , or share in profits. If significant, this means a
portion of what would have been wage income is paid as dividends (property income) to the same
people, thus raising the property share but not concentrating it at the top. Countries could give tax
breaks or legal incentives for ESOP formation. Over time, more workers would have a second source
of income from capital.
Public or Community Ownership : e.g. municipal ownership of utilities or cooperative businesses
where members get dividends. These too distribute profits as income. While usually smaller scale,
they contribute to the property income of ordinary people.
Individual Asset-building Programs:  like matched savings accounts, baby bonds (each newborn
gets a publicly funded savings account to use in adulthood), or policies to increase home ownership
among low-income families. Home ownership can generate imputed rent (a form of property
benefit) and real rental income if, for example, people rent out a room. Stock ownership increases
dividends received. Many countries have subsidized retirement savings which effectively turn part of
labor earnings into future capital income (private pensions invested in markets). Strengthening
these schemes for the lower and middle class will gradually reflect in the index as a higher share of
income coming from investments for those groups.
All these measures have a common aim: shift a portion of national income from wages to capital, but in an
egalitarian way . If successful, one would expect the index’s capital income share to rise in tandem with an
increase  in  the  percentage  of  households  receiving  some  capital  income  (which  could  be  separately
monitored). This could improve resilience (since households have multiple income streams) and autonomy
(some income not tied to a boss or government program). It addresses what some call “property-owning
democracy”  – giving people a stake in capital. However , it’s a long-term strategy; the index gives a way to
track progress.
4. Strengthening Wages and Labor’s Share:  On the other side, perhaps the policy goal is to
maintain a healthy wage share despite automation – i.e., ensure work pays and is available. To raise
or preserve the wage portion  of income:
Labor Market Institutions:  Strengthening labor unions, raising minimum wages, or extending
collective bargaining can push a larger slice of enterprise income to wages rather than profits. If
labor captures more value, the wage share in national income can stabilize or rise. Some OECD
research suggests declining union density and bargaining power contributed to labor’s falling share26

. Reversing those trends (through legal reforms, sectoral bargaining systems, etc.) could be
reflected in a higher wage component of the index over time, as wages grow faster than capital
income.
Wage Subsidies and Job Guarantees:  The government can directly or indirectly bolster labor
income by subsidizing employment. For example, an Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or direct wage
subsidy raises take-home pay for low-wage workers (increasing their labor income without relying
on market forces alone). A public Job Guarantee  program would offer work at a base wage to
anyone who wants it, thus virtually eliminating involuntary unemployment. This injects additional
wage income (funded by the state) into households rather than transfer income. It’s essentially a
transfer , but delivered as wages for work, which might conceptually still count under “labor income”
in our index (depending on definition). The effect is that fewer people have zero wage income. If
implemented broadly, such policies would increase the aggregate wage share (and likely also
increase total income by activating idle labor). The index would show a rise in the wage portion and
possibly a decline in pure transfers (if people move from unemployment benefits to public jobs, for
instance).
Technological and Educational Initiatives:  Ensuring that workers can fill new roles complementing
automation (through training, etc.) can sustain labor’s role. If technology is used in a labor-friendly
way (augmenting worker productivity and wages) rather than purely replacing workers, the labor
share might not fall as much. While harder to quantify, the index will eventually reflect whether
wages keep up or not. Policies ranging from education, R&D targeting labor-intensive sectors, or
migration (bringing in more labor) might be considered to influence the labor share indirectly.
A society might deliberately aim for a balanced scenario: not letting wage share drop too low even in a high-
tech era, thus keeping work as a central means of livelihood but under better conditions (shorter hours,
higher pay – sometimes called  “labor decommodification”  in the sense of making labor less of a harsh
necessity). The index will register if wage income remains, say, above 50% over time rather than collapsing
to 30%. If despite efforts the wage share keeps falling, that’s a signal to double-down on other measures or
accept that transfers must rise to compensate.
5. Expanding and Innovating the Social Safety Net:  If the goal is to increase the transfer share  as a
way to guarantee basic income floor (or to deliberately reduce reliance on labor), policies include:
Universal Basic Income (UBI):  Providing a flat payment to all citizens regularly. This would directly
increase the transfer portion of income for everyone. It essentially socializes a part of consumption –
everyone gets a minimum income from the state, irrespective of work. UBI trials and proposals often
emerge in discussions of a post-work future. If funded sufficiently, a UBI might make the transfer
share a very large component (while possibly shrinking wage share if people choose to work less or
if wages adjust downward due to the income floor – complex general equilibrium effects). The index
would obviously capture a UBI introduction as a step change in transfer share. Its diagnostic value
would then be to monitor any unintended effects (like if labor incomes drop or wealth incomes
concentrate further when UBI is financed by broad taxes).
Targeted Transfer Enhancements:  Increasing pension replacement rates, unemployment benefits,
child allowances, healthcare subsidies (which free up income) – all of these raise the effective
transfer share. Europe’s higher transfer shares compared to the U.S. reflect such choices . For
example, if policymakers want to reduce poverty among the elderly, they might raise public pension
payouts; the index’s transfer component for retirees would go up, and at aggregate level might inch
up as well (especially in aging societies).27

Public Services as Transfers:  Providing free or subsidized essential services (education, healthcare,
housing)  doesn’t  show  up  as  cash  transfers  in  income,  but  it  increases  disposable  income
equivalently  (by reducing out-of-pocket costs). In an expanded sense, one could incorporate the
value of such services into the “transfer” component (as Social Transfers in Kind). Countries pursuing
Universal Basic Services (UBS) instead of cash UBI would see improved living standards without as
big a change in cash transfer share. But if we account for it, their “extended transfer share” would be
higher .  This  approach  decommodifies  certain  expenditures  and  could  be  considered  part  of
economic agency (freeing people from needing as much cash income). For the index’s core (cash
basis),  UBS  won’t  reflect  directly,  but  an  analyst  might  note  that  a  moderate  transfer  share
underestimates support if public services are large.
6. Regulatory and Structural Reforms:  Some deeper structural shifts can also influence income
composition:
Corporate Governance Reforms:  e.g., requiring companies to share profits with workers or
communities (which effectively turns some would-be profits into wage or transfer-like distributions).
Limiting Rent-Seeking : If an economy has a high property share due to things like expensive
housing rents or monopolistic pricing (generating excess profits), anti-trust and pro-competition
policies might reduce those unearned incomes, indirectly raising the labor share (if wages then form
a higher portion of a slightly smaller total income) or reducing inequality. The index might not
immediately show “where it went” (the lost rent might just reduce GDP), but if successful could
create conditions for higher labor compensation.
Conditionalities and Incentives : For example, tying executive pay (which is labor income for a few)
to broad employee bonuses (labor income for many) can spread income; or mandating profit-
sharing above a certain profit level. These nuanced tools also target the composition indirectly by
altering how income is channeled within firms.
To illustrate a policy scenario: suppose a government wants to  raise the property income share of the
bottom 20% from virtually 0 to, say, 5%  of their total income in a decade. They could establish a social
wealth fund that pays a small dividend (which for the bottom 20% would constitute a notable income
addition), encourage pension auto-enrollment so more low-income workers build assets, and promote
employee ownership especially in industries with many low-wage workers. The index at the quintile level
would show property income rising for that group, and nationally maybe a slight uptick in the capital share
that is more broad-based. Complementarily, if the same government is concerned that wage share is falling
too fast due to automation, it might implement a job guarantee for displaced workers, thereby converting
what would have been transfer payments (welfare or unemployment benefits) into wages paid for public
work – keeping those individuals in the wage column of the index rather than transfer column.
The Economic Agency Index is thus not only descriptive but can serve as a target  for policy. A country could
set goals, such as: “By 2030, we aim to have at least X% of household income coming from assets broadly held by
the public”  or “We want to reduce reliance on transfers by getting people into good jobs, lowering transfer share
by Y points and raising wage share by Y points.”  Of course, not all goals are about maximizing one component
– there might be an optimal balance. In a stable, inclusive economy, one might envision an index where
each  source  contributes  significantly  (a  diversified  livelihood  portfolio  for  society).  Excess  in  any  one
dimension can be risky: too much wage reliance (vulnerable to tech shocks), too much capital reliance
(inequality, volatility), or too much transfer reliance (fiscal strain, political risk). The index helps identify
excesses and shortfalls, and track whether policies are moving the economy toward a desired equilibrium.•

Conclusion
The proposed Economic Agency Index offers a new lens to understand and shape our economies in the 21st
century.  By  breaking  down  household  income  into  wages,  property,  and  transfers,  it  provides  a
comprehensive view of the engines of aggregate demand and the pillars of people’s livelihoods . In a
post-neoliberal era – marked by questioning of laissez-faire orthodoxies and the rise of automation – this
index fills a vital informational gap. It draws attention to the distribution of economic agency: who derives
income from their own labor , who benefits from capital ownership, and who depends on societal support. 
Our review of existing measures showed pieces of this puzzle scattered in academic and statistical work
(labor shares, Gini decompositions, etc.), but no unified metric to bring it all together . The justification for
the index is evident in current trends: wage labor’s share is under pressure , wealth and capital income
are  concentrated ,  and  government  redistribution  is  carrying  a  larger  load .  Without  an  index,
policymakers risk missing these tectonic shifts or misunderstanding their implications. With the Economic
Agency Index, they can diagnose the health of the social contract in a way GDP or employment rates alone
cannot.
The methodology outlined ensures the index is  grounded in reliable data  and standardized definitions,
making it feasible for institutions like the OECD or national governments to implement. As demonstrated,
interpreting the index yields rich insights: a high transfer share might warn of unsustainable dependencies
or highlight a strong social safety net; a high property share could ring alarm bells about inequality and
consumption  gaps;  a  high  wage  share  might  call  attention  to  labor  market  fragility  in  the  face  of
automation. These interpretations connect directly to policy levers – from taxes and transfers to innovative
schemes like social wealth funds or employee ownership – giving the index practical relevance as a guide
for action.
Ultimately, the Economic Agency Index is both a mirror and a map. It holds up a mirror to an economy’s
structure, reflecting fundamental characteristics of its distribution system. And it serves as a map for
navigating toward a more equitable, resilient future: policymakers can identify where they are (perhaps a
transfer-dependent or capital-dominant regime) and chart a course to where they want to be (perhaps a
more  balanced  composition  that  fosters  widespread  prosperity  and  security).  In  a  world  where  the
relationships between work, wealth, and welfare are rapidly evolving, such a compass is not just helpful – it
may prove essential for steering economies in a human-centered direction beyond neoliberalism.
