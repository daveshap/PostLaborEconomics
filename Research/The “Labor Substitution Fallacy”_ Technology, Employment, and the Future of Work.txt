The “Labor Substitution Fallacy”: Technology,
Employment, and the Future of Work
Introduction
Advances in automation and artificial intelligence have reignited an old debate about technology’s impact
on jobs. A common assumption – which we term the  “Labor Substitution Fallacy”  – is the belief that
whenever technology displaces human labor , the economy will automatically  create an equivalent number
of new jobs for people. In other words, it assumes some intrinsic economic law ensures that new goods and
services will always require human workers. This view is often offered as a rebuttal to fears of mass
technological unemployment, and it echoes the dismissal of the so-called “lump of labor” fallacy. The lump
of labor fallacy  holds that it is mistaken to assume a fixed amount of work; historically, new industries and
“infinite human wants” have generated new employment opportunities even as old jobs were automated
. While it is true that past innovations eventually produced new kinds of jobs, the  Labor Substitution
Fallacy  challenges the automaticity of this process. It posits that there is no fundamental economic law
that new products or services must  be produced or delivered by humans – especially as machines surpass
human cognitive and physical abilities at lower cost . In an era where AI and robotics can potentially
perform  any task humans can (and more), it is conceivable that new needs and industries could expand
without proportional growth in human employment. This report analyzes that possibility with data and
historical perspective, contrasting it with the traditional view. We will review labor displacement from the
Industrial  Revolution  through  the  software  and  AI  revolutions,  examine  whether  recent  decades’
automation has led to net job losses, and assess evidence that demand for human labor may be entering
structural decline. We also consider which human roles might persist (due to experiential or sentimental
value) and evaluate counterarguments that AI will augment or create new human jobs. Throughout, we
draw on economic history, labor statistics, and current research to provide a comprehensive, data-driven
analysis for economists, historians, and policy experts.
Historical Patterns of Technological Displacement
Technological disruption of labor is not new. History provides many examples of machines replacing human
(or animal) work in one sector , while new jobs eventually arose in others. The Industrial Revolution  of the late
18th–19th  centuries  offers  a  classic  case.  In  England’s  textile  industry,  mechanized  looms  dramatically
increased productivity, threatening skilled weavers. The Luddite riots of 1811–1816 were a reaction to these
machines displacing manual labor . During the early decades of industrialization, wages for many workers
stagnated  even  as  output  grew  –  a  phenomenon  dubbed  “Engels’  pause”  (1790–1840)  where  British
working-class wages were flat while productivity and profits surged . This suggests that in the short run,
new technology  did displace workers and depress labor’s gains. Eventually, however , new industries and
expanded output absorbed many of the displaced workers. By the late 19th century, for example, the British
textile sector was producing cloth so much more cheaply that demand exploded, and  power looms had
automated 98% of the labor needed per yard of fabric – yet the number of weaving jobs actually
increased  over that period . Lower cost per yard led to lower prices, which greatly increased demand for
cloth; that higher demand meant more total cloth produced and  more  weavers employed, even though1

each  weaver  handled  far  more  output.  Likewise,  weavers’  remaining  tasks  (like  overseeing  multiple
machines)  became  more  valuable,  and  their  wages  rose  in  the  late  1800s .  This  pattern  –  initial
displacement  and  hardship,  followed  by  eventual  growth  of  new  jobs  and  higher  living  standards  –
characterized much of the Industrial Revolution.
A similar dynamic played out in other sectors. In the agricultural  sector , mechanization steadily displaced
farm labor throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1900, roughly 34% of the U.S. labor force worked in
agriculture; by the early 2000s this had plummeted to just ~1–2% . The total number of farm workers
fell  dramatically  (U.S.  farm  labor  employment  shrank  sixfold  during  the  20th  century)  even  as  total
agricultural  output  grew .  Yet  this  vast  labor  displacement  did  not  lead  to  permanent  mass
unemployment: freed farm workers migrated to cities and found work in the burgeoning industrial and
service sectors. For example, the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw explosive growth in manufacturing
jobs,  which  easily  absorbed  workers  leaving  farms.  In  the  United  States,  manufacturing  employment
expanded through the mid-20th century, peaking around 32% of nonfarm employment in 1953 . Even
jobs eliminated by one innovation were often offset by jobs created by another . A famous illustration is the
transition from horse-drawn transport to automobiles: in the early 1900s a huge share of land and labor
was devoted to raising and tending horses, which essentially vanished by mid-century; but millions of new
jobs appeared in auto manufacturing, road construction, petroleum, and related industries to support the
automobile economy.
By the mid/late 20th century, economies had largely completed the shift from agrarian to industrial to
service-oriented. In the United States and other developed countries,  employment in agriculture fell
below 2%  and manufacturing’s share also eventually declined sharply . The slack was taken up by the
service sector , which grew to dominate employment. By 2023, roughly  79% of U.S. workers were in
services , ~19% in industry, and only ~1.6% in agriculture  – a complete inversion of the labor distribution
a century prior . This pattern was echoed globally (albeit at different paces): in 1991, over 40% of the world’s
workers were in agriculture, but by 2022 that had fallen to about 27%, with nearly 50% of global workers
now in services4

. Developing countries like China followed a compressed version of this trajectory, rapidly industrializing
and then automating. China’s manufacturing employment, for instance,  peaked in the 1990s and then
began  to  decline  as  productivity  soared .  One  analysis  notes  that  increased  automation  and
productivity  in  the  late  1990s  led  Chinese  firms  to  eliminate  millions  of  factory  jobs .  In  short,
technological  revolutions  historically  caused  large  shifts  in  which  sectors  employed  people.  Whole
categories of jobs (hand-loom weavers, blacksmiths, farmhands, etc.) vanished, but new categories (factory
workers, machinists, electricians, later service and knowledge workers) rose to take their place. Crucially,
overall employment kept rising over the long run as populations grew and new products created new
demand. There was no sustained  net destruction of jobs across the whole economy in the 19th or 20th
centuries – unemployment in industrialized nations typically remained low outside of cyclical recessions.
This historical record underpins the optimistic view that “technology always creates more jobs than it
destroys.” However , the continuity of this trend is now being questioned as we enter the age of advanced
software and AI.
Automation in Recent Decades: Job Creation vs. Job Destruction
The late 20th century – roughly from the 1980s onward – saw the rise of computers, robotics, and the
internet, which have deeply affected labor markets. Unlike earlier mechanization that mainly impacted
agriculture and manufacturing, digital technology began to automate white-collar and service tasks. The
question is whether this recent wave of automation has continued to create as many jobs as it displaces, or
if we are seeing a structural shift toward net job loss (or slower job growth). The evidence is mixed but
worrisome. On one hand, total global employment  has continued to grow in absolute terms over recent
decades (thanks to population growth and development in emerging markets). On the other hand, several
trends suggest that automation has put downward pressure on labor demand, especially for certain skill
groups and in advanced economies.
One clear trend is the decline of manufacturing employment  in many developed countries since the late
20th century. In the United States, manufacturing jobs peaked in 1979 at about 19.6 million  workers; by
2019, manufacturing employment was down to 12.8 million – a 35% decline even though U.S. population
and output grew in that period . Every recession since 1980 cut manufacturing jobs that never fully
returned in the subsequent recovery . This was not merely due to offshoring; a primary driver was
automation and productivity improvement. U.S. factories now produce more  goods with far fewer workers.
Indeed,  from  1990  to  2019,  U.S.  manufacturing  output  rose  substantially  even  as  manufacturing
employment  fell  by  roughly  one-third .  The  same  phenomenon  occurred  in  other  countries
(“deindustrialization” of employment), and even globally manufacturing jobs have stagnated or fallen  in
recent decades . For example, China’s manufacturing workforce shrank after the late 1990s because
automation allowed higher output with fewer workers . This indicates that recent technology (robots,
computerized controls, etc.) can cause net job losses in specific large sectors without an immediate one-for-
one creation of new jobs elsewhere.
Another salient trend is job polarization  in advanced economies. Automation since the 1980s has tended
to wipe out many middle-skill, routine-heavy jobs (such as assembly line operators, clerical staff, or machine
operators), while jobs at the high-skill and low-skill ends grew. A wide body of research documents this
polarization: routine, middle-wage occupations have steadily declined as a share of employment, whereas
high-wage professional jobs and low-wage service jobs expanded . In the United States, essentially
all net job growth since 2000 has been in non-routine occupations , with middle-skill routine jobs in
manufacturing and clerical work disappearing and not returning after recessions . One study finds that9

after each recession in recent decades, routine jobs failed to rebound – leading to “jobless recoveries” –
because those tasks had been automated or offshored permanently . This reflects a structural shift:
when companies invest in technology to cut labor during a downturn, the previous jobs simply  do not
come back , and workers must find different types of work if they can.
What about total employment versus population? So far , advanced economies have avoided a surge in
permanent unemployment – headline unemployment rates in the U.S., for example, have often been low in
the 2000s and 2010s (aside from recession spikes). However , other indicators hint at weakening labor
demand. Labor force participation among working-age men in the U.S. has declined over the last few
decades, and growth in total employment has been slower than in mid-20th century “full employment” eras,
despite the rise of gig and part-time work. The labor share of national income  – the portion of output paid
out as wages – has also fallen. Globally, the labor share has significantly declined since the early 1980s ,
across most countries and industries . One seminal study attributes roughly half of this decline in labor’s
share to technological factors – specifically, the sharp drop in the price of computing and equipment that
made it cheaper to substitute capital for labor . In plain terms, as robots and software got cheaper ,
companies found it cost-effective to automate more tasks, reducing the relative demand for human labor
and thus labor’s slice of the economic pie. Another symptom is the decoupling of productivity and wages .
In the decades after World War II, worker productivity and median wages rose in tandem; since the late
1970s, productivity kept rising but median wages stagnated, indicating workers were not gaining from the
growth  the  way  they  used  to.  While  multiple  forces  are  at  play  (globalization,  weaker  unions,  etc.),
automation  and  software  are  part  of  this  story  –  enabling  greater  output  without  commensurate  job
growth, and putting downward pressure on many workers’ earnings.
It is important to note that the economy did create millions of new jobs in the past 40 years – for example,
entirely new fields in information technology, an explosion of service sector roles, and a large expansion of
healthcare and education employment. Total employment in the U.S. rose from about 90 million in 1980 to
nearly 168 million today. Many economists thus argue that fears of “net job destruction” are overblown:
outside  of  manufacturing,  most  sectors  continued  to  add  jobs.  Indeed,  computerization  has  often
coincided with job growth in certain occupations . One analysis found that occupational groups with
high computer use (e.g. engineering, office work, healthcare)  actually grew faster  than the overall labor
force from the 1980s to 2010s, whereas low-tech sectors (like basic manufacturing) grew slower or declined17

.  This  suggests  computers  complemented  many  types  of  work  even  as  they  automated  others.  As  an
illustrative case, the deployment of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)  in banking did not eliminate bank
teller jobs overall. By automating routine cash-handling, ATMs made it cheaper to operate bank branches,
so  banks  opened  more  branches  and  teller  employment  stayed  roughly  stable  (and  even  trended  up)
through the 2000s . The role of tellers evolved – less coin-counting, more customer service – but
their jobs remained. Chart 1  below shows how the number of bank tellers in the U.S. held steady even as
ATM installations skyrocketed, thanks to this dynamic adjustment . 
Chart 1: ATMs vs Bank Tellers. Even as ATMs spread (red line), U.S. teller jobs (blue line) did not drop during 1970–
2010. Lower branch costs led banks to open more branches, keeping tellers employed . Tellers’ tasks shifted to
customer relations, illustrating how automation can change job content without eliminating the job outright.

Similar stories played out elsewhere: the introduction of barcode scanners did not eliminate retail cashiers
overnight – instead, cashier jobs persisted while new roles like “sales associate” and inventory management
techs grew. Spreadsheet software reduced demand for lower-level bookkeepers but increased demand for
financial analysts. These observations highlight that  recent automation has often been task-specific :
certain tasks within a job are automated, altering the job rather than erasing it. Optimists argue this gives
workers  and  institutions  time  to  adapt  (through  retraining,  shifting  roles,  etc.),  rather  than  causing
immediate large-scale unemployment. Indeed, an influential study in 2015 titled “Why Are There Still So
Many Jobs?” noted that “Polanyi’s Paradox”  – the fact that many human skills (judgment, creativity, social
intelligence) were hard to automate – meant computers would for a time mainly handle routine, codifiable
tasks . This protected many high-skill and service jobs that required flexibility or human touch.
However , as we will explore, recent advances in AI are beginning to overcome some of those historical
limits, potentially automating even non-routine cognitive tasks.
In summary, the period from the 1980s to 2020s shows a complex picture. Automation has unquestionably
eliminated millions of jobs  in manufacturing and routine office work and contributed to a squeeze on
middle-class employment . Yet, it also coincided with growth of new jobs and industries  (from IT and
software development to renewable energy, logistics, and personal services). The economy has so far
avoided a net collapse in work: unemployment remained low pre-pandemic, and new kinds of work (often
gig-based or in the care economy) have emerged. However , the quality of many new jobs is debated – for
instance, many service jobs are lower-paid and less secure than the manufacturing jobs they replaced. More
alarmingly, there are signs that the balance between jobs lost and jobs gained may be shifting . A recent
empirical study found that the rate at which technology creates new tasks for labor has slowed, while the
rate  of  automation  has  not  –  “recent  evidence  indicates  [automation]  is  outpacing  [new  work
creation]” , as Acemoglu and Restrepo put it . If true, this is a break from the past, when new industries
eventually absorbed displaced workers. We may be reaching a point where the scale and speed of AI-driven
automation exceed the economy’s ability to invent enough new roles for humans.
“Infinite Wants” vs. the Labor Substitution Fallacy
The conventional economic rebuttal to worries about automation is rooted in two ideas: human wants are
infinite , and labor is fungible . As long as people can conceive of new products, services, or experiences to
desire, there will be new work to do. The argument holds that when technology makes one good cheaper ,
consumers spend their savings on other goods or new types of services, which in turn creates jobs in those
areas . This mechanism is sometimes called the compensation effect : productivity improvements lead
to higher incomes or lower prices, which then boost demand for labor elsewhere. In this view, there is no
finite “lump” of work; rather , work evolves with our needs. Historically, this logic often held. For example,
when  automation  dramatically  cut  the  labor  needed  to  produce  a  yard  of  cloth,  the  cost  of  textiles
plummeted and people bought more clothing – supporting more jobs in textile production (albeit different,
machine-centric jobs) . When farming became ultra-efficient, food got cheaper and people spent their
money on new goods like cars, appliances, vacations, healthcare, education – spawning new industries and
jobs in those sectors. Classical economists like Say and Schumpeter pointed to such processes as evidence
that technology-driven growth  reallocates  labor rather than eliminating it: workers move from declining
sectors to expanding ones fueled by new demand. In the 20th century, this seemed almost axiomatic; every
major wave of innovation (electricity, automobiles, computing, etc.) eventually led to more  total employment
and higher living standards. This is why fears of permanent “technological unemployment” were often
dismissed as a “Luddite fallacy”  or lump-of-labor fallacy. Even as recently as the 2010s, many economists2425

argued that “if human desires are endless, there will always be new jobs” , because automation-driven
cost savings will be spent on something that requires human labor to produce .
The Labor Substitution Fallacy  challenges a critical hidden assumption in the above narrative – namely,
that new goods and services will necessarily require human  labor to produce or deliver . It posits that there is
no economic law guaranteeing that humans must perform the new jobs  created by new demand .
In the past, it just so happened that every innovation still relied on humans at some stage: machines could
not fully run without people. Even as late as the early internet era, “there was essentially nothing you could
buy that did not require some human labor hours” somewhere in production or delivery . But as AI and
robotics advance, this linkage is weakening. We are entering an era where it is conceivable that machines
can do nearly everything  – not just manual factory work, but driving, translating languages, analyzing
data, even creative and social tasks to a degree. Gerald Huff, in describing what he calls the “Labor Content
Fallacy,” states it plainly: “There is no law of economics that states that producing a good or service must require
human labor.”  It was true historically because machines were limited to narrow functions, but it is not a
fixed rule. As AI gains abilities like natural language, perception, and decision-making, businesses may
innovate  without  needing  to  hire  humans  in  large  numbers,  because  for  the  first  time  there  is  an
alternative to human labor for almost every task .
A simple hypothetical illustrates this breaking of the historical pattern: Suppose automation makes some
service  cheaper  and  consumers  save  $100  million  that  they  then  spend  on  new  entertainment  –  say,
downloading  digital  content  or  subscribing  to  an  AI-powered  app.  In  the  past,  $100  million  of  new
consumer spending would support lots of jobs (artists, retail clerks, etc.). But today, if that money goes to
purchase 100 million AI-generated music downloads at $1 each , essentially zero  new jobs are created by
that spending . Producing and distributing additional digital copies has near-zero marginal labor cost –
the servers and algorithms do the work. Even if consumers spend on a service like a messaging app or an
AI-driven platform, a tiny tech team can serve hundreds of millions of users. Huff gives the example that
WhatsApp handled 450 million users with a staff of under 50 – so even an influx of revenue would hardly
require hiring more humans . Contrast this with a scenario where consumers instead spent that
$100 million on haircuts or restaurants  – labor-intensive services – which would absolutely require hiring
many more barbers, stylists, cooks, and waitstaff. The  point is that the link between increased consumer
spending and job creation is no longer guaranteed ; it depends on the nature of what is purchased . As
more consumption shifts to things like digital goods, AI-curated services, or highly automated products,
much of that spending  decouples from human employment . Huff argues this will “break the historical
connection between consumption and job creation” that we’ve taken for granted .
Another angle on the infinite-wants argument is that new industries will arise that we can’t even imagine
today, providing employment for those displaced by automation. Certainly, this has happened before – a
person in 1900 could scarcely foresee jobs like web designer , DNA scientist, or video game developer . Some
economists and futurists claim that AI itself will generate  entirely new occupations  and sectors, just as
past general-purpose technologies did. For instance, the invention of the airplane not only automated long-
distance travel (displacing some ship and rail jobs) but also created the aviation industry with pilots, flight
crews, air traffic controllers, aerospace engineers, etc. – jobs that never existed before . Indoor plumbing
eliminated the need for water-carrying servants but created the modern plumbing trade . Following this
logic, optimists say  AI will create new demands and expertise  we can’t yet fully predict . Perhaps
entirely new fields (say, in virtual reality, space colonization, climate engineering, personalized medicine) will
emerge and employ millions. This is a valid possibility – history teaches us to expect surprises. The question
is  scale and necessity : will these new human-centric jobs be numerous enough, and specifically require1

humans  despite advanced AI, to offset the losses? The Labor Substitution Fallacy cautionary thesis is that we
should not simply assume the answer is yes. Even if  human wants are endless, ever-cheaper AI and robots
might fulfill many of those wants with minimal human labor input. Unlike in the past, new industries might
scale up with machines doing most of the work . We already see hints of this in today’s tech sector: some
of the most valuable companies (by market capitalization) employ far fewer people per dollar of revenue
than industrial giants of old. A striking example often cited is  Kodak versus Instagram  – at its height,
Kodak  employed  140,000  workers  in  the  film  photography  business,  whereas  Instagram  had  only  13
employees  when it was acquired for $1 billion in 2012 . A digital startup can reach a global market with a
tiny workforce, leveraging software and network effects. Thus, a new “industry” can emerge (digital photo-
sharing, social media) that attracts huge consumer engagement and dollars, but employs a sliver of the
people the old industry did. The worry is that this could be a template across many domains: the new
ventures of the AI age simply won’t require as many workers as the old sectors they displace.
In summary, the traditional view based on infinite wants and historical precedent holds that new jobs will
always materialize; the Labor Substitution Fallacy perspective argues that this time might truly be different
because new work might not need us . The critical distinction from the lump-of-labor fallacy is subtle: it’s
not that there is a fixed amount of work; rather , it’s that even if the amount of work  is infinite, it might be
done by non-human actors. There is no iron economic rule guaranteeing humans will remain the default
source  of  labor  for  new  tasks .  Recognizing  this  possibility  is  crucial  as  we  project  the  future  of
employment.
Evidence of Structural Decline in Labor Demand
Is demand for human labor in secular decline? Several economic indicators and theoretical projections
suggest we may be on the cusp of such a structural shift (if it hasn’t started already). We have already
discussed the falling labor share of income and the decoupling of productivity from median wages, both
consistent with a weakening relative demand for workers . Beyond those, consider the following
evidence and forecasts:
Jobless Recoveries and Slowing Employment Growth:  Since around 1990, each U.S. recession has
been followed by a weaker employment rebound, particularly in routine occupations . Research
by Jaimovich and Siu finds that essentially all U.S. net job growth in the 2000s was in non-routine
jobs; routine jobs lost in recessions never recovered, implying a permanent structural reduction in
those jobs . This contrasts with earlier eras (1950s–1970s) when jobs of all types bounced back
after downturns. Slower employment recovery despite GDP growth can indicate that technology is
enabling output to rise without rehiring workers – a sign of labor demand erosion in certain sectors.
Global Trends in Industrial Employment:  As noted, even emerging economies are automating.
One striking data point:  Chinese manufacturing employment peaked in 1996 at roughly 126
million and then began to fall , despite continued growth in Chinese manufacturing output . For
the world as a whole, the share of employment in manufacturing has been declining since the 1990s
as automation spreads. The classic development model (workers move from farms to factories) may
now be short-circuited by robots, leading to “premature deindustrialization” in some developing
countries – where manufacturing peaks at lower income levels and with fewer jobs than it did in
earlier  industrializers.  If  billions  of  people  in  developing  nations  cannot  rely  on  labor-intensive
industrial  growth  because  robots  do  it  more  cheaply,  global  labor  demand  could  stall  even  as
population grows in some regions.35

Automation vs. New Job Creation Rates:  Economists Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo, in a
2019  study,  present  a  model  where  technology  both  displaces  labor  (automation  of  tasks)  and
creates  new  labor-intensive  tasks.  They  warn  that  in  recent  decades,  at  least  in  the  U.S.,  the
displacement effect has dominated – the creation of new tasks for labor has not kept up with the loss of
old tasks . In fact, recent evidence suggests automation is outpacing the genesis of new tasks
. This marks a departure from much of the 20th century, when major new job categories (e.g. in
healthcare, education, services) continually emerged. Supporting this, a cross-country analysis by the
OECD finds that the elasticity of employment with respect to productivity gains has fallen – meaning
productivity growth now translates to fewer new jobs than in past eras. In plain terms, whereas a
doubling of productivity used to eventually lead to a big expansion of employment (through lower
prices and higher demand), now productivity gains are more likely to simply reduce the number of
workers needed without proportionate job creation elsewhere.
AI Capabilities and Task Scope:  The development of  AI that can perform cognitive and even
creative tasks  is a game-changer . Traditionally, automation hit manual and routine cognitive work
hardest. But modern AI (such as machine learning and robotics) is encroaching into non-routine
realms:  driving  vehicles,  translating  speech  in  real  time,  writing  news  articles,  coding  software,
drafting  legal  documents,  diagnosing  illnesses,  even  generating  artwork  and  music.  As  these
technologies improve, the range of occupations at risk expands from blue-collar and clerical into
skilled  white-collar  and  professional  domains.  A  widely  cited  2013  study  by  Frey  and  Osborne
estimated that up to  47% of U.S. jobs  were at high risk of automation in the coming decades
(though  not  all  would  disappear  so  quickly) .  More  recent  analyses  by  McKinsey  Global
Institute, the OECD, and others have produced varying figures, but all acknowledge tens of millions
of jobs in advanced economies could be automated with current or near-future tech.  McKinsey
(2017) , for instance, projected that by 2030 automation could displace between 400 and 800 million
jobs worldwide , and that  as many as 375 million workers (14% of the global workforce) might
need  to  transition  to  new  occupations  due  to  AI  and  robotics .  They  noted  advanced
economies would face the highest reskilling burdens, with up to one-third of the workforce in the
U.S. and Germany needing to shift jobs, and nearly half in Japan . While these are projections
(and subject to uncertainty and policy response), the scale is unprecedented. If even half of 800
million jobs were offset by new job creation, it would still imply enormous upheaval. And if the Labor
Substitution Fallacy  holds true, many of those new jobs might not materialize in the form of human
employment at all.
Deceleration of New Sector Formation:  Historically, each wave of innovation eventually gave rise
to entire new sectors employing large numbers: e.g. railroads, automotive, telecoms, IT services.
Some analysts argue that recent innovations, despite their impact, have not generated employment
on the same scale. The IT and software sector , for instance, produces high value but with relatively
few  jobs  (often  highly  skilled).  The  app  economy  and  online  platforms  have  created  new
opportunities (like gig work, e-commerce logistics), but many are either small-scale or effectively
automations of traditional roles (e.g. Amazon’s fulfillment centers replacing retail clerks). We do not
yet see a giant new labor-intensive industry comparable to, say, the manufacturing boom of the
early 20th century or the office boom of the mid-20th. Some economists point out that many of the
job gains in the last 30 years came from non-tradable services (healthcare, education, hospitality)
that are driven by domestic needs and often subsidized or regulated, rather than from the tech
sector  per  se.  If  those  service  sectors  themselves  start  automating  (as  AI  enters  education,
healthcare,  etc.),  it  could  remove  one  of  the  last  big  engines  of  job  growth.  Already  we  see•

experimentation with AI tutors, robot-assisted surgery, automated customer service agents, and
algorithmic management that reduces the need for middle managers.
Labor  Productivity  vs.  Total  Hours  Worked:  Another  macro  measure  to  watch  is  total  hours
worked per capita. In some advanced countries, total work hours per person have leveled off or
declined, not just due to demographics or preferences, but possibly because fewer hours are needed
to produce the growing output. In a world where automation takes a larger share of production, it is
conceivable that total work hours required will fall, meaning fewer jobs or more part-time work
(unless work hours per job are cut). Historically, reduced working hours were taken as increased
leisure (e.g. the workweek fell from 60+ hours a century ago to ~40 hours). The optimistic scenario is
that AI could enable a similar leisure increase – a 20-hour workweek with the same pay, for instance
– but only if the benefits of automation are widely shared. Absent deliberate redistribution, the risk is
instead joblessness for some and overwork for others, exacerbating inequality.
Taken together , these points build a case that we are on the verge of, or perhaps already in, an era where
demand for human labor is not continuously expanding  alongside technological progress, as it did in
the past. Importantly, this doesn’t mean all human work disappears overnight; rather it may plateau or
gradually decline relative to population and productive capacity. The adjustment could be very uneven –
certain highly skilled or creative individuals might be in more demand than ever (complemented by AI),
while those with automatable skills find opportunities drying up. The devaluation of human labor  in general
is a possible outcome if machines become vastly more productive and cheaper . As one commentary noted,
there is no guarantee that automation and new work creation will “arm-wrestle to a draw” – recent trends
suggest automation is winning . Even if total jobs remain equal, the  composition  will shift, and many
workers may not be equipped to fill the new roles without massive retraining.
Human-Centered Jobs: Sentimental, Experiential, and Social Value
In assessing the future of work, it’s crucial to ask: what kinds of jobs or economic activities are likely to
remain  dominated by human labor , even when technology is capable? There are certain domains where,
regardless of technological capability,  human touch and authenticity are part of the product’s value .
These roles might endure not out of necessity, but because people  choose  a human-provided service or
good over a machine-made one for subjective reasons. Some examples include:
Artistic and Performative Work:  Even if an AI can compose music or paint, many people will still
derive special enjoyment from art created by a human mind and performed by human hands. We
already  see  that  live  concerts  and  theater  remain  popular  (indeed,  live  event  employment  has
grown), despite digital recordings being available. The experiential value  of being in the presence of a
human performer is high. Studies show people often have a bias in favor of human-created art over
AI-generated art when told of the source  – suggesting a psychological preference for human
creativity. Professional sports is another area: robotics could theoretically play a flawless soccer
match,  but  spectators  want  to  watch  humans  compete.  These  leisure  and  entertainment  jobs
(musicians, actors, athletes, etc.) thus have a degree of protection from automation, not because
machines cannot do them, but because the audience cares that they are done by humans. That said,
these fields are relatively small in employment (e.g. in the U.S., the entire arts, entertainment and
recreation industry employs on the order of 3 million people, <2% of the workforce) . They
can’t absorb tens of millions of displaced workers, and many such jobs are highly competitive or low-
paid except for a lucky few at the top.•

Personal Care and Emotional Labor:  Jobs that involve empathy, human interaction, and trust –
such as childcare, nursing, therapy, counseling, teaching, and eldercare  – are often cited as more
resistant to automation. It’s not that robots or AI assistants can’t  perform physical or informational
aspects of these jobs (robots can lift patients; AI can answer medical questions), but the  human
connection  is a core part of the service. For example, many elderly people may simply feel more
comfortable with a human caregiver , associating it with genuine compassion and company. Surveys
have found mixed attitudes about robot caregivers: while some are open to it for certain tasks, a
significant share of people – especially those not yet in need of care – express a preference for
human caregivers over robots . Similarly in therapy or mental health support, even if an AI could
simulate a conversation, patients might value the fact that a fellow human being is listening. There is
also an element of ethical and accountability trust  – we might prefer a human doctor to deliver a
diagnosis  or  a  human  teacher  to  mentor  our  child,  because  we  ascribe  responsibility  and
understanding to a person in a way we don’t to a machine. These preferences could sustain demand
for human providers. It’s notable that healthcare and social assistance jobs have grown robustly
in recent years and are projected to continue growing as populations age. In the U.S., healthcare
support is among the fastest-growing occupational categories. However , these jobs can be physically
and emotionally demanding and often not highly paid. If they are the catch-all for displaced workers,
it could lead to an oversupply and further depressed wages in the sector unless there is intervention
(or higher willingness to pay for personal services).
Education and Coaching:  Teaching is partly content delivery (which AI can do) but also motivation,
mentorship, and socialization – roles for which human teachers are valued. We may see AI tutors
and personalized learning software reduce the need for some instructors, but parents and students
often desire a human presence for inspiration and oversight. Niche areas like personal coaching
(fitness trainers, life coaches, etc.) might also persist because the human relationship itself provides
accountability and motivation that a digital coach might not. That said, if AI tools become good
enough, one could imagine a hybrid model – fewer teachers overseeing more students who mainly
learn from intelligent software, which could reduce the number of teaching jobs. The ultimate extent
to which society values human educators (potentially at higher cost) over AI will shape this outcome.
Custom, Craft, and Boutique Services:  There may be a market for artisanal and handcrafted goods
even when mass-produced automated goods are cheaper and flawless. In a world of perfect 3D-
printed products, a hand-made imperfect item might become a status symbol or hold sentimental
value. Already, we see niche markets for things like hand-stitched leather , bespoke furniture, or
organic hand-farmed foods – often sold at a premium as “authentic” or eco-friendly alternatives to
industrial output. These niches could expand as automation commodifies most products. Some
displaced workers might find refuge in craft entrepreneurship, albeit serving a relatively affluent
clientele. Again, volume is a concern: artisanal goods are, almost by definition, low-volume and
cannot replace mass employment. If an AI can bake bread and brew beer more cheaply at scale,
most consumers might still buy the cheap product, while a small segment supports human bakers
and brewers as a luxury. So, while craft and custom work will exist, they likely won’t provide jobs on
the scale of the industries that get automated.
“Human Experience” Economy:  A broader category often discussed is jobs that involve  human
presence as part of the experience  – for example, a human tour guide versus an audio guide, a
bartender who lends an ear , a human wedding photographer (even if AI could auto-generate photos,
the couple might want a person at their event), or a chef who performs culinary art in front of diners.•

There are also roles in hospitality and luxury services where human attendants are part of the brand
(think five-star hotels with human concierges, even if a kiosk could check you in). These may persist
for high-end markets or for those who seek social interaction. In contrast, budget services will likely
automate (some hotels already have robot receptionists). So the human-touch jobs might cluster in
the higher-cost, bespoke part of the market.
In essence, the jobs most likely to remain human are those where humanness is a feature, not a bug  –
where substituting a robot or AI would fundamentally change the value of the offering. Societally, we may
also choose to keep humans in certain roles for safety or ethical reasons (e.g. some argue there should
always be human oversight in law enforcement or military decisions; or that AI should not make life-and-
death medical calls without a human doctor). These choices could preserve some jobs. However , even in
these fields, technology will likely reduce the number of humans needed or change the nature of the work.
For instance, one nurse might monitor 10 patients with the help of AI rather than 5 patients without it,
thereby potentially halving staffing ratios, even if you still “need a human in the loop.” So job quantity  could
fall even if the job doesn’t disappear entirely.
Critically, we must ask whether these human-centered occupations can absorb the vast numbers of workers
potentially freed by automation elsewhere. Many economists are skeptical. The caring professions (health,
education, social work) are among the largest employers already, but they have limits – funding (often
government  or  household  budget  constrained)  and  certain  skill  or  temperament  requirements.  Not
everyone can or wants to be a nurse or teacher , just as not everyone is artistically or entrepreneurially
inclined  for  creative  work.  There  is  also  a  practical  limit  to  society’s  consumption  of  certain  personal
services; people only have so many hours for concerts, salon appointments, or counseling sessions. Some
hypothesize a future where services expand greatly (e.g. far more eldercare as populations age), which
could indeed create a lot of jobs –  if those jobs are valued and paid for . Yet if automation makes goods
incredibly cheap, it’s possible the average person won’t earn much (due to low labor demand) and thus
won’t be able to afford many personal services, keeping those sectors limited. This is the scenario of a
polarized  society:  affluent  individuals  enjoy  artisanal,  human-provided  luxuries  and  personal  attention,
while  the  masses  consume  AI-provided  services  by  necessity  because  it’s  all  they  can  afford,  having
themselves been displaced into precarious low-wage gigs.
Counterarguments: AI Augmentation, New Sectors, and Policy
Responses
No discussion of this topic is complete without acknowledging the counterarguments – the reasons many
economists and technologists believe AI will augment  human labor or create new human-centric jobs, rather
than render human work obsolete. Let’s examine and critique some of these optimistic scenarios:
1. AI as a Tool that Amplifies Human Productivity:  One argument is that AI will function less as a
replacement and more as a  complement  for many jobs – essentially a powerful tool that makes workers
more productive, similar to how personal computers did. If each worker can produce more output with AI
assistance, theory suggests that the economy can grow faster , demand can increase, and ultimately more
workers might be hired to meet that higher demand (the classic productivity-to-employment linkage). We
have historical precedents: spreadsheet software didn’t eliminate accountants – it made each accountant
faster , and businesses used that capability to handle more financial analysis, arguably keeping or even
increasing employment in finance departments. In medicine, AI diagnostic tools might allow doctors to
12
treat more patients or focus on complex cases, potentially improving outcomes and creating demand for
more specialists and support staff. The key assumption here is that higher productivity leads to enough
new work to keep humans busy . Optimists believe there is an endless backlog of problems to solve and
improvements to make (curing diseases, building infrastructure, personalized services, etc.) such that AI
freeing up human time will simply allow humans to move to the next, often more complex task. Indeed, we
may see the nature of jobs shift: AI handles the routine 80%, and humans focus on the 20% of cases that
are tricky or require personal interaction. This kind of human-AI partnership  or “hybrid workforce” could
become the norm. New roles such as “AI trainers,” “AI explainers,” or “automation ethicists” might arise to
facilitate this collaboration. Evidence that augmentation is possible comes from current pilot projects – e.g.
human radiologists working with AI diagnostics have higher accuracy than either alone, suggesting not a
replacement but a team augmentation scenario.
Critique:  Augmentation will certainly happen in many areas in the short-to-medium term. However , the
concern is what happens when AI becomes  very good. The better the AI gets, the less human input is
needed even in complex tasks. Initially, AI might take over routine paperwork for lawyers, letting them
focus on courtroom arguments; but eventually AI might handle much of the legal research, drafting, and
maybe even case strategy, leaving far fewer tasks for the attorney. At some point, the human  in the loop can
become the weakest link – and companies may decide the AI can operate with one human overseeing 10 AI
systems rather than 10 humans each with an AI assistant. Augmentation can thus transition into outright
replacement as technology matures. Additionally, augmentation improving productivity doesn’t guarantee
employment grows; it might just mean each worker can do more, so you need fewer workers to achieve the
same  output  (unless  demand  for  output  grows  dramatically,  which  is  not  infinite  in  every  domain).
Augmentation helps those who have the skills to work with AI (making them more valuable), but those who
don’t may be left further behind.
2. Creation of Entirely New Industries and Jobs:  This is the argument of historical analogy – just as
electrification  led  to  appliances  and  electronics  industries,  and  the  computer  led  to  IT  and  software
industries,  AI  might  lead  to  new  industries  we  can  barely  imagine.  Some  possibilities  floated  include:
extensive  climate  mitigation  projects  (maybe  deploying  AI  and  robotics  to  rebuild  infrastructure  or
carbon capture – employing people in green tech),  space exploration and colonization  (if launch costs
drop,  perhaps  a  boom  in  space  industry  jobs  from  engineers  to  miners  on  asteroids),  personalized
entertainment and experiences  (people might pay for bespoke VR experiences, employing creatives and
designers), and sectors like quantum computing, biotech, or nanotechnology  that might flourish on the
back of AI advances, requiring human scientists and technicians. Another specific area is  care economy
expansion : as society gets wealthier (potentially from AI-driven growth), perhaps more resources will be
devoted to education, mental health, community building – jobs that are hard to automate completely.
Optimists often cite that 60%+ of jobs in 1940 didn’t exist in 1900 , and similarly, a large portion of jobs in 2040
may be in roles that don’t exist today. They also note that hybrid job categories  are already emerging: e.g.
“prompt engineers” who craft inputs for AI models, or “AI quality analysts” who check AI outputs – these
were not jobs even a few years ago. 
Critique:  Yes, new industries will come, but  will they be labor-intensive?  The trend of modern tech
industries is low labor-intensity (e.g. a small startup can create a hugely popular app). Even where a new
field requires a lot of work (say, retrofitting every building for energy efficiency to address climate change),
much of that work could be done by automated systems (robots installing solar panels or AI systems
optimizing energy grids). If we consciously choose labor-intensive approaches (like a government jobs
program  for  climate  adaptation),  that  could  create  jobs,  but  absent  policy,  companies  will  likely  use
13
automation  to  maximize  efficiency.  Moreover ,  new  high-tech  industries  tend  to  demand  highly  skilled
workers – which doesn’t solve the problem for the average displaced worker . We may end up with millions
of former drivers or factory workers who cannot easily transition to being robotics engineers or biotech
researchers. So even if total number  of jobs is saved by some new industry, who gets those jobs becomes a
major issue. This is already seen in the polarization: STEM and professional jobs grow, but not everyone can
attain the credentials for those, and not everyone wants to or is capable of working in those domains.
3. The  Augmented Human Demand  Argument:  Some posit that as AI takes over production, humans
themselves become the “product” in a different sense – that is, there will be rising demand for human
experiences and interaction precisely because  they are human. We touched on this with arts and care work.
Futurist Martin Ford has suggested that in a future where machines do everything efficiently, one of the
only things left that has economic value is human authenticity  – people might pay to watch real humans play
sports instead of robots, or eat a meal cooked by a person instead of a food robot just for the novelty. This
could create a kind of  experience economy  where more people work in roles providing interaction or
entertainment to others. It’s conceivable that currently unpaid activities (socializing, hobbies, caregiving for
relatives) could be monetized in new ways – for instance, companionship services for lonely people, or
curated social clubs – essentially jobs that revolve around humans spending time with other humans. In a
sense, it’s like the economy loops around to valuing human time because  most other things are handled by
machines. 
Critique:  There is some logic here, but it may not scale to everyone. Not everyone can make a living being
an  entertainer  or  companion;  demand  for  these  services  might  actually  decline  if  many  people  are
underemployed and have more free time to socialize without paying for it. Also, if inequality grows (a few
have high incomes from owning AI capital while many have low incomes), the mass market for discretionary
human services might shrink. Only the wealthy may afford personal human services, limiting the size of that
labor market. A scenario can be imagined where a small class of wealthy individuals are serviced by a
slightly  larger  class  of  human  service  providers  (chefs,  tutors,  personal  trainers),  and  the  rest  of  the
population is either on some form of public support or scrambling in the remaining low-end jobs. Without
broad purchasing power , the “human experience economy” could be niche.
4. Policy and Shorter Workweeks:  A very important counterpoint is that even if labor demand falls, society
can respond in ways that avoid massive unemployment. One historical response to productivity gains was a
reduction in working hours – e.g. workweeks fell and retirement age dropped over the 20th century as
people chose more leisure with their higher income. Some economists suggest that AI’s productivity boost
could enable a 3-day workweek  or a six-hour workday  for everyone, spreading the available work among
more people. In effect, rather than 50% of people being jobless while 50% work full-time, perhaps 100% of
people work half-time. This would require social and policy choices (and probably strong labor movements
or government interventions) to implement; otherwise, firms might just employ fewer people full-time and
leave others unemployed. Another policy response is training and education  investments so that workers
can fill the new types of jobs that do appear . If governments and businesses proactively retrain truck drivers
to become solar panel installers or robot technicians, for example, displacement could be managed (this, of
course, is easier said than done at scale). Finally, there is the proposal of Universal Basic Income (UBI)  or
similar safety nets to decouple livelihood from employment. If indeed automation reduces the need for
human labor , UBI could provide income to everyone, funded by the productivity gains of AI (via taxes on
capital or data or wealth). Individuals might then choose to work less or pursue creative endeavors without
needing a traditional job for survival. In the context of the Labor Substitution Fallacy, UBI is seen as a way to
14
address the scenario where the economy can produce abundance with few workers – it ensures people still
have purchasing power to benefit from that abundance .
Critique:  These policy solutions are not automatic – they require political will and societal consensus.
Historically, reductions in work hours happened partly organically and partly through labor struggle. In
recent decades, progress on shortening the workweek has stalled in many countries. Without deliberate
effort, it’s conceivable that companies will simply let unemployment rise or create more precarious gig jobs
rather than share work evenly. UBI is still experimental at large scales, with unanswered questions about
implementation and public support. Moreover , if people derive meaning and purpose from work, a workless
(or work-light) society might face challenges of social cohesion, even if material needs are met. That veers
into philosophical territory but is worth noting: the future of human purpose  is at stake alongside the future
of jobs.
In evaluating these counterarguments, one must differentiate between short-to-medium term  and long
term .  In  the  medium  term,  AI  will  likely  augment  many  jobs  and  create  some  new  roles  (like  AI
maintenance, data science, etc.), and with smart policies we could avoid high unemployment. In the very
long term, if AI and robotics reach a level where they can do virtually any task better and cheaper than a
human, then the only jobs left will be those we deliberately  reserve for humans or those that by preference
we  refuse  to  automate.  At  that  point,  the  economic  rationale  for  employing  humans  (productivity)  is
superseded by social/ethical  rationale. We might enter a post-scarcity economy where jobs as we know them
are largely obsolete – but getting from here to there could be tumultuous. The Labor Substitution Fallacy
essentially warns that  market forces alone won’t guarantee new jobs for all displaced workers  once
technology is highly capable. If society wants to maintain full employment or broad prosperity, it will have
to make conscious choices – possibly redefining work, sharing wealth, or valuing human-provided goods in
new ways. 
Conclusion
The notion of the Labor Substitution Fallacy  compels us to re-examine our complacent assumptions about
technology  and  jobs.  History  has  shown  that  waves  of  innovation  can  cause  painful  disruption,  but
ultimately  new jobs have always arisen  and overall employment reached new heights. This track record
underpins a widely held faith that “in the end, everything will work out – new wants, new industries, and
new jobs will appear .” However , as this report has detailed, there is  no automatic guarantee  of that
outcome, especially under the unprecedented circumstances we face: machines that can outthink and
outdo humans in an expanding array of tasks, and at lower cost. The core thesis – that new goods and
services  in  the  future  might  not need  human  labor  by  default  –  is  supported  by  multiple  strands  of
evidence. We see it in the decoupling of consumption from jobs in digital industries , in the declining
labor share of income as capital substitutes for labor , and in empirical signs that recent technological
change is creating fewer new roles even as it automates old ones . If these trends continue or accelerate
with AI, we could reach a tipping point where the economy simply does not generate enough new work for
humans to replace the work that technology has taken over .
That said, the future is not pre-determined. Economies are not just governed by iron laws; they are shaped
by policies, institutions, and societal values. We stand at a crossroads where one path leads to enormous
productivity  and  wealth  with  far  less  human  labor  –  a  scenario  that  could  either  be  dystopian  (mass
unemployment and inequality) or utopian (leisure and abundance shared by all), depending on how we
respond. Another path doubles down on human skills – investing in education, creativity, empathy – carving4445
29

15
out  domains  where  humans  stay  relevant  and  perhaps  even  limiting  technology’s  reach  in  certain
professions for ethical reasons (for example, insisting on “human in the loop” in healthcare, or valuing
human  art  and  craftsmanship  through  cultural  preference).  The  traditional  economic  view  is  being
challenged, but it doesn’t mean we abandon all optimism: it means we must be proactive. As one analysis
put it, “the industrialized world appears poised to run out of workers before it runs out of jobs”
when considering demographics – but if those jobs no longer require workers, the statement may need
revision. 
In practical terms, experts increasingly recognize that we should prepare for a future where  the link
between technological progress and job creation is weaker  than it used to be. This includes rethinking
education (focusing on uniquely human skills and adaptability), strengthening social safety nets (possibly
exploring mechanisms like UBI ), encouraging job-sharing or work-time reduction to spread work, and
fostering sectors where human labor is central to the product. It also involves updating our economic
metrics: if GDP can grow while many people are left jobless or underemployed, we need measures of well-
being that capture that and policies to address it. Dismissing concerns of technological unemployment as a
simple fallacy is no longer tenable – it is a possibility we must take seriously, even if it ultimately can be
mitigated. 
In conclusion, the Labor Substitution Fallacy  reminds us that while human wants may be infinite, there is
nothing guaranteeing that humans  will be the ones fulfilling those wants. The “invisible hand” of the market
may not save us if the market finds machines more efficient. Historically, new frontiers of work for humans
opened up – from factory floors to offices to service centers – but we are nearing a horizon where there
may  be  no  new  frontier  of  labor  that  machines  cannot  also  conquer .  Avoiding  a  future  of  structural
unemployment or a “useless class” of workers will require intentional action. By recognizing that this time
could  be  different,  we  can  move  beyond  complacency  and  ensure  that,  if  the  age  of  AI  is  to  bring
unprecedented prosperity, it is a prosperity shared by and inclusive of the humans who inhabit that future.
The  lesson  of  this  analysis  is  not  doom,  but  vigilance:  there  is  no  natural  law  of  economics  that
guarantees a happy ending for workers – it’s up to us to create one .
