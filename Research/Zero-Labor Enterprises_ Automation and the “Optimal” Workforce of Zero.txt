Zero-Labor Enterprises: Automation and the
“Optimal” Workforce of Zero
Introduction
In an age of rapid automation, a provocative business hypothesis has emerged: the optimal number of
employees for any business is zero . This concept suggests that companies, driven by efficiency and profit,
will continuously minimize human labor as technology advances – ultimately approaching a point where no
human  employees  are  needed.  While  zero  employees  is  an  extreme  theoretical  ideal,  the  underlying
rationale  is  clear .  Businesses  have  always  sought  to  hire  only  the  minimum  number  of  workers
necessary  to  operate  effectively  and  maximize  profitability .  As  automation  technologies  improve  in
capability and cost-efficiency, the equilibrium staffing level for many operations trends ever downward,
perhaps asymptotically toward zero.
This report presents an in-depth analysis of that hypothesis, focusing on the  economic and business
rationale  behind  workforce  minimization  through  automation.  We  will  examine  historical  trends  and
current developments across a range of industries – from manufacturing and logistics to services, software,
finance, retail, agriculture, and healthcare – to understand how automation has reduced headcounts and
how far this trajectory might go. Key topics include: 
Historical automation uptake and employment trends  in each sector , illustrating how technology
has increased output while often reducing labor requirements. 
Current automation technologies  (robotics, artificial intelligence, software bots, Internet of Things,
etc.) and their adoption rates in various industries. 
Cost-benefit analysis of machines vs. human labor , exploring why firms opt for automation: e.g.
operational efficiency, scalability, lower marginal costs, and improved consistency. 
Case studies  of companies that have aggressively automated operations, in some cases achieving
“lights-out” facilities with minimal human oversight. 
Future scenarios and projections (5–10+ years)  for each industry, considering likely advances and
the potential for further workforce displacement or transformation. 
Counterexamples and limits  – industries or tasks where full automation hasn’t reduced headcount,
or where human labor remains more economical or effective, highlighting practical and economic
constraints to a zero-employee vision.
Crucially, the focus is on  economic and business incentives . We will analyze how automation serves
operational efficiency, scalability, marginal cost reduction, profit maximization, and the capital vs. labor
tradeoff. Broader social or ethical implications (e.g. unemployment or societal impact) are  not the focus,
except insofar as they directly influence business decisions (such as regulatory pressures or consumer
acceptance affecting automation strategies). The tone of this report is analytical and grounded in data,
aimed at an expert readership interested in the evolving landscape of automation in business.•

By surveying cross-industry evidence and expert projections, we aim to shed light on whether and how
businesses might approach the “zero employees” ideal. Is a fully autonomous enterprise a realistic goal in
certain sectors? What are the economic drivers pushing in that direction, and where do humans remain
irreplaceable from a business standpoint? The following sections tackle these questions, starting with the
fundamental economic rationale for replacing human labor with machines.
The Economic Rationale for a Zero-Employee Business
Why would a business strive to have as few employees as possible – in the extreme case, zero? The answer
lies in the core drivers of operational efficiency and profit maximization . Employees are costly resources:
firms must pay wages or salaries, benefits, and other expenses (office space, training, management) for
each worker . Human labor also comes with limitations – people require breaks and time off, can only work
so  many  hours,  and  are  prone  to  error  or  inconsistency  in  repetitive  tasks.  By  contrast,  automation
promises  a  workforce  of  tireless  machines  and  software ,  which  can  potentially  work  24/7  with
unwavering  precision,  after  a  one-time  capital  investment.  From  a  purely  economic  perspective,  if  a
machine can do the same job as a person (or better) at lower long-term cost, a profit-maximizing business
has incentive to use the machine and reduce its human workforce.
Labor Cost vs. Automation Cost
A fundamental calculation businesses make is the comparison of labor cost to the cost of automation .
Automation usually involves an upfront capital expenditure (buying a robot or developing software) and
ongoing maintenance, whereas human labor is a continuous expense (wages, benefits, and so forth). Over
time, as technology advances, the cost of machines tends to decrease or deliver more performance per
dollar ,  while  human  wages  often  rise  (especially  in  developed  economies  or  in  sectors  facing  labor
shortages). This economic pressure encourages replacing labor with capital. As one industry executive
famously observed in the context of rising minimum wages, “It’s cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it
is to hire an employee who’s inefficient making $15 an hour bagging French fries” . This stark comparison by
a former fast-food CEO highlights that once the cost of a robot (amortized over its useful life) falls below the
cost of paying a worker , automation becomes the financially prudent choice.
Consider industrial robots: The  operating cost of a typical robot  can be only a  fraction of a human’s
wage . For example, a medium-sized industrial robot (100 kg payload) uses electricity that costs roughly
$0.75 per hour  to run . A human worker performing similar tasks might earn $15–20 per hour in many
economies. In other words, the robot costs perhaps only 5% of the human’s hourly rate to operate , after the
initial purchase. Even factoring in the up-front cost of the robotic system (potentially on the order of
$200,000–$250,000  for  a  fully  integrated  setup),  the  return  on  investment  can  be  rapid.  One  analysis
showed that a $250,000 automation system (two robots with auxiliary equipment) could pay for itself in
about 2 years  by replacing four manual laborers, and then yield about \$1.5 million in net savings by year 7
.  After  the  payback  period,  the  ongoing  “wage”  of  the  robots  is  minimal  (just  power  and
maintenance), leading to dramatically lower per-unit production costs . This positive cash flow from labor
savings accelerates in later years of the robot’s service life .
From the business’s perspective, such savings go straight to the bottom line. Automation also reduces the
variability of costs  – unlike human wages which may increase with overtime or require raises, a machine’s
cost is largely fixed and predictable. This allows for better scalability: an automated process can often be
scaled up to produce more output with only marginal additional cost (perhaps just running machines1

longer or adding extra machines), whereas scaling up with human labor is directly proportional to hiring
more staff.
Efficiency, Consistency, and Quality
Beyond direct cost comparison, automation provides benefits in efficiency and quality  that have economic
value. Machines excel at repetitive tasks – they do not tire or lose concentration. This leads to lower error
rates  and  higher  uniformity  in  production  or  service  delivery .  For  instance,  in  manufacturing,
automated systems can perform the same task the same way every time, yielding consistent product
quality.  “Machines never get fatigued or distracted, and they perform tasks with very little variation for long
stretches,”  as noted in a manufacturing analysis . Reducing error rates can save costs on rework, waste,
and quality control. Similarly in services, a software algorithm processing transactions or forms will do so
identically each time, eliminating human errors that might slip in due to fatigue or oversight.
Automation also often speeds up processes . A well-designed machine or algorithm can operate faster than
a person. For example, in warehouses, a robotic sorter or an AI route optimizer can handle throughput far
quicker than manual methods. Increased speed shortens cycle times, allowing more output (and revenue)
in the same period. This higher productivity per unit of time is a key efficiency gain that justifies automation
investments.
Moreover , robots and software can work  around the clock . Removing human shift constraints means a
factory or service system can operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week if needed (so-called “lights-out”
operation). This maximizes asset utilization and can dramatically increase the output relative to a single 8-
hour or even double 16-hour shift operation. The marginal cost of extra runtime  is very low for machines
– running a robot for an additional hour might only incur a bit of electricity cost, whereas keeping a human
overtime  incurs  significant  wage  premiums.  In  essence,  automation  can  drive  the  marginal  cost  of
production toward zero , especially in software (where producing one more unit of a digital good costs almost
nothing). Businesses highly value this, because once the fixed costs are covered, additional sales become
almost pure profit.
Scalability and Flexibility
Automating core processes also enhances scalability . A heavily automated business can handle surges in
demand by simply activating more machine capacity or cloud computing power , rather than engaging in
frantic hiring. For example, a software service that is largely run by algorithms can serve an expanding user
base with minimal staff increases – the classic case being messaging platform WhatsApp serving hundreds
of millions of users with only 55 employees . Prior to its acquisition by Facebook, WhatsApp had 420
million  users  but  just  55  employees ,  an  almost  unheard-of  user-to-employee  ratio  in  traditional
businesses . This was possible because the product (a messaging app) was entirely software-based and
highly automated in its operation; scaling to more users mainly meant adding server capacity, not people.
Instagram’s story is similar: it reached 30 million users with only 13 employees  before being bought by
Facebook .  These  examples  show  how  digital  and  software-centric  businesses  achieve  massive
scalability  with  tiny  workforces ,  leveraging  automation  in  infrastructure  and  processes  to  support
growth.  While  not  every  industry  can  replicate  the  economics  of  software,  the  general  point  stands:
automation allows growth without a proportional growth in headcount , which is extremely attractive
to companies.56

It should be noted that automation can also provide a form of operational flexibility  – though machines
themselves are typically rigid in their specific task, modern automation systems (especially software and AI)
can be reprogrammed or retooled faster than re-training a large human workforce. For instance, advanced
manufacturing robots or 3D printers can switch to new product designs by loading new software or design
files, enabling quick pivots in production without needing to hire new workers with different skill sets. In
white-collar settings, RPA (Robotic Process Automation) bots can be reconfigured to handle new digital
workflows much faster than the time it would take to reassign and retrain staff. This flexibility has business
value as it allows companies to adapt to market changes while keeping their labor costs lean.
Capital vs. Labor Trade-offs
Economic theory often frames automation decisions as a  trade-off between capital and labor . Firms
choose a mix of inputs to minimize cost for a given output. Automation essentially means substituting
capital (machines, software – which require upfront investment) for labor (ongoing wage expense). Several
factors influence this decision:
Cost  of  Capital:  Low  interest  rates  or  falling  technology  prices  make  it  cheaper  to  invest  in
automation. In recent years, the cost of industrial robots and computing power has been dropping,
and cloud computing allows firms to “rent” AI capabilities at low cost. This reduces the barrier to
replacing jobs with tech. For example, the price-performance of robotics has improved such that
even medium and small manufacturers find robots cost-effective now, whereas a decade or two ago
they were affordable mainly for high-volume large companies. Service robots and AI software have
similarly become more accessible. 
Cost of Labor:  On the other hand, rising wages, increased minimum wages, or labor shortages push
companies toward automation. The quote above about a $15/hour worker vs. a $35k robot arm was
in the context of minimum wage debates  – if human labor becomes more expensive (either by
law or market demand), automation’s appeal grows. In some cases, even relatively low wages  can be
higher than the effective cost of automation, especially for simple, repetitive jobs. For instance,
major electronics manufacturers in China started heavily automating in the 2010s as factory worker
wages there rose. Foxconn – Apple’s main iPhone assembler – noted it was  deploying robots to
replace routine tasks  as part of an ongoing effort to cut costs . By 2016, a Foxconn factory
reportedly automated away 60,000 jobs  by introducing robots for many assembly tasks . While
Foxconn still employs over a million people, that initiative shows how even in historically labor-
intensive assembly work, machines became the cost-favored option as wages climbed. (It’s worth
noting Foxconn said it would retrain some displaced workers for higher-value roles , but the
direct labor reduction is telling.)
Skills and Reliability:  Sometimes it’s not just cost but  availability and reliability  of labor . Certain
industries experience shortages of skilled workers, and automation can fill the gap. For example,
some manufacturing firms report that in certain regions “there are more jobs than workers with
the requisite skills” . Rather than struggling to recruit scarce talent for tedious manual tasks, a
company might automate those tasks and redeploy the limited human talent to more complex
duties. This reduces dependence on an uncertain labor market. Automation also doesn’t call in sick
or quit unexpectedly, providing a more stable production capacity.•

Quality  and  Precision  Needs:  In  fields  where  precision  and  error  reduction  are  paramount
(semiconductor manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, financial computations, etc.), automation is often
adopted not primarily to cut labor cost, but to achieve quality standards that humans might not
consistently meet. However , once adopted for quality, the side effect is often a reduction in labor
needs as well. 
In summary, businesses are economically motivated to automate when doing so lowers the long-run cost,
increases output, or improves quality  – ideally all three. The profit incentive  naturally drives firms to use
the least amount of labor necessary  to meet their goals. Historically, this has meant that as soon as a job can
be done more cheaply or effectively by a machine, companies will consider that option. Over decades, this
dynamic is why we see fewer workers doing tasks that have become automatable, even as production and
productivity hit new highs. 
Before  diving  into  specific  industries,  it’s  useful  to  reflect  on  the  historical  arc  of  automation  and
employment  to understand that today’s trend toward minimal employees is part of a long continuum.
Historical Trends: Automation’s Impact on Employment
Automation is not a new phenomenon – it has been transforming work and employment structures for
centuries. From the mechanization of agriculture in the early 20th century to the computer revolution of the
late  20th  century,  each  major  technological  wave  has  boosted  productivity  while  often  displacing
workers from certain tasks . A look at historical trends provides context for why the “optimal” number of
employees tends to fall as technology advances.
Agriculture  offers a dramatic example. In 1900, farming was labor-intensive and employed a huge portion
of the workforce. In the United States, about 40% of all workers were employed in agriculture in 1900 .
Then  came  widespread  adoption  of  mechanization  –  gas-powered  tractors,  harvesters,  and  other
equipment revolutionized farm work . These technologies enabled one farmer to cultivate far more land
and produce far more output than dozens of farmhands could before. The result: by 2000, agricultural
employment had plummeted to  under 2% of the workforce , yet farms were more productive than ever
. The labor saved was enormous – one modern combine can reap in hours what once took teams of
workers days to accomplish. This freed up vast numbers of people to move to other sectors of the economy.
It’s a clear case where the “optimal” number of farm workers for a given output effectively fell close to zero
relative  to  the  past  (not  literally  zero,  but  close  in  percentage  terms).  Mechanization  delivered  “more
efficient use of labor and increased production” , as noted in historical analyses, enabling huge declines
in farm labor needs .
A similar though less extreme shift occurred in manufacturing . Manufacturing’s share of employment in
the U.S. peaked at over 25% in the 1950s. By today, it’s under 10% . Part of this decline in share is due to
growth of other sectors, but in absolute terms manufacturing employment in many developed countries
has dropped significantly from mid-20th-century highs. Yet manufacturing output has continued to grow .
In fact, U.S. manufacturing output roughly doubled from 1990 to 2016 (+72%), even while the number of
manufacturing workers fell by about 30% . That means the U.S. was producing nearly twice as many
goods with only 70% of the workforce compared to 1990 – a testament to automation and productivity
gains .  Labor  productivity  in  U.S.  manufacturing  grew  140%  in  that  period,  indicating  that  each
remaining  worker ,  augmented  by  technology,  was  far  more  productive  than  before .  Studies  have
attributed the majority of manufacturing job losses in recent decades to automation rather than offshoring :•

one analysis found 87% of U.S. manufacturing job losses from 2000–2010 were due to automation and
productivity improvements, versus only 13% due to trade competition . In other words, the factories
didn’t vanish – they just don’t need as many people, because machines do more of the work.
This pattern –  output up, employment down  – is seen in other sectors as well when automation takes
hold.  Mining  for example: today’s mines use huge automated or semi-automated equipment (giant haul
trucks, mechanized drilling, etc.), resulting in far fewer miners needed to extract a ton of ore than decades
ago. Steel production  saw something similar; continuous casting and robotic controls mean modern steel
mills produce as much with a few hundred workers as old mills did with thousands. Economist James
Bessen  recounts  how  certain  jobs  follow  an  inverted  U-shape  over  time:  they  rise  with  an  industry’s
expansion, but eventually technology catches up and employment declines even as production sets records
(bank tellers, discussed below, is one such example) .
At the same time, automation has begun expanding beyond manufacturing into services and white-
collar  roles ,  especially  with  advances  in  computing  and  artificial  intelligence.  While  early  automation
(mid-20th century) mostly affected manual and routine tasks (factory assembly, clerical calculations, etc.),
the 21st century is seeing more sophisticated automation tackling cognitive and non-routine tasks. This
broadens the scope of jobs at risk. A seminal study by Frey and Osborne (2013) estimated that about 47% of
total U.S. employment is in occupations at high risk of automation  in the coming decades (based on
technical feasibility) . Similarly, a comprehensive McKinsey Global Institute study found that with
currently demonstrated technology,  approximately half of all work activities (in terms of time spent)
could  theoretically  be  automated  in  the  mid-term  future .  McKinsey  noted  that  in  their  baseline
scenario, about  49% of work activities could be automated by 2055 , but this could happen decades
sooner or later depending on various factors . Even if entire jobs aren’t fully automated, a majority of
occupations could see a substantial fraction (≥30%) of their tasks taken over by machines . This implies
that across many fields, fewer workers would be needed to accomplish the same functions, because each
worker would be complemented by machines doing part of the work – or in some cases, eliminated if
machines do all the work.
It’s important to mention that historically, even as automation has eliminated specific jobs, new jobs and
industries have arisen  – the classic example being that the Industrial Revolution destroyed many artisan
weaver jobs but created factory jobs, and later new service jobs, etc. So the total number of jobs in the
economy didn’t go to zero; rather , it shifted. However , from a business’s  micro perspective, the goal in any
given process is often to reduce the human input required , whether or not those humans find alternative
employment elsewhere. Our hypothesis focuses on that micro perspective – each individual enterprise
aiming to minimize its own headcount through technology, even if those displaced workers hopefully find
roles in new areas of the economy.
To gauge where we are headed in the near future, the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs 2023  report
offers a telling forecast. Surveying hundreds of companies, it found that by 2027, employers expect to
create 69 million new jobs globally  but eliminate 83 million existing jobs , a net loss of 14 million jobs
(about 2% of current employment) due largely to technological adoption and other business trends . In
other words, companies foresee more roles being phased out by automation/streamlining than new roles
being  added  in  emerging  areas  over  just  a  five-year  horizon.  They  anticipate  significant  workforce
transformation: nearly a quarter of all jobs changing in nature by 2027, with some disappearing entirely .
McKinsey’s research likewise projects that by 2030, on the order of 400–800 million individuals worldwide
could be displaced by automation  and need to transition to new jobs . These figures underscore14

that the trend of automation reducing the need for human workers is not slowing down – in fact, it may be
accelerating as AI and robotics capabilities advance.
Having set the stage with these broad trends, we now delve into  cross-industry analysis . Each of the
following sections examines a specific sector , looking at how the number of workers required has evolved
with automation, what technologies are currently in play, the cost-benefit calculus in that industry, notable
case studies of high automation, and projections for the next decade. We’ll also note any countervailing
factors within each sector that might limit full automation. The industries we will cover are: Manufacturing,
Logistics (including warehousing and transportation), Services (with subdomains like hospitality and
professional services), Software/Tech, Finance, Retail, Agriculture, and Healthcare . Together , these
span a large portion of the economy and illustrate different stages and facets of the journey toward the
“zero employee” ideal.
Manufacturing: Toward the Lights-Out Factory
Manufacturing has been at the forefront of automation for decades – it’s the sector that gave birth to the
term “lights-out factory,” referring to facilities so automated they need no human presence (and hence
could literally operate in the dark). The manufacturing industry’s drive for efficiency, precision, and cost
reduction has made it a heavy adopter of robotics, machine tools, and computerized control systems. As a
result, many factories today output more with  fewer workers  than ever before. The ultimate vision in
manufacturing is the “autonomous factory”  where machines handle production end-to-end, supervised by
only  a  handful  of  people  in  control  rooms  or  maintenance  roles.  While  few  factories  are  completely
workerless, the trend is clearly toward increasing levels of automation and correspondingly leaner staffing.
Automation Uptake and Current Technologies
Industrial  robotics  have  been  a  game-changer  in  manufacturing.  Since  the  introduction  of  the  first
industrial robots in the 1960s, their presence has grown exponentially. As of 2023, there are over 4 million
industrial robots operating in factories worldwide , a new all-time high . To put that in perspective,
annual installations of robots have exceeded half a million units in recent years . Robot “density” – the
number of robots per 10,000 manufacturing workers – is often used as a metric of automation. Globally,
robot density has more than doubled in the last seven years. In 2023 the average was  162 robots per
10,000 workers , up from 74 per 10,000 in 2016 . In other words, for every 100 human factory workers
worldwide, there were roughly 16 robots aiding production in 2023, and rising. In the most advanced
manufacturing nations, these figures are far higher: South Korea, for instance, leads the world with 1,012
industrial robots per 10,000 employees  – effectively one robot for every 10 workers on factory floors
. Other highly automated manufacturing economies include Singapore (~770 robots/10k workers) and
Germany and Japan (each in the few hundreds per 10k range) .
Modern factories deploy a  suite of automation technologies  beyond just articulated robots welding or
assembling parts. Computer numerical control (CNC) machines  automate machining processes. Additive
manufacturing (3D printing)  can automatically produce parts with minimal human steps, often directly
from digital designs . Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs)  or Autonomous Mobile Robots roam factory
floors  delivering  materials  without  human  forklift  drivers .  Machine  vision  systems  do  quality
inspection at high speeds. Entire production lines are orchestrated by software (Manufacturing Execution
Systems) with Industrial IoT sensors  and networks (the Industry 4.0 paradigm) enabling equipment to self-25

adjust and coordinate in real-time . Emerging tech like AI-driven predictive maintenance  reduces
downtime by automating equipment monitoring and decision-making.
Crucially, all these technologies aim to remove labor from various production steps  – whether it’s physical
labor (robots replacing assemblers, AGVs replacing material handlers) or cognitive labor (AI scheduling
production or inspecting for defects instead of human managers and inspectors). By combining these,
some  factories  have  reached  a  point  where  only  a  skeleton  crew  of  humans  is  needed,  mainly  to
monitor systems and handle exceptions or maintenance .
The concept of “lights-out” manufacturing , where a factory operates with no on-site workers, has moved
from science fiction to limited reality. As early as the 1980s there were attempts at fully automated factories,
though those early efforts often failed due to technical limitations . In recent decades, however , several
success stories have emerged . A famous example is a FANUC plant in Japan that reportedly uses robots to
build other robots, running with  no human intervention for weeks at a time . FANUC, a leading
robotics company, essentially proved it could  use robots to manufacture the very robots it sells , in a self-
sustaining loop. 
Another  oft-cited  example  is  the  Philips  electric  razor  factory  in  the  Netherlands .  This  factory  was
contrasted  with  an  older  Philips  plant  in  China:  the  Chinese  factory  employed  thousands  of  workers
assembling razors by hand, whereas the Dutch factory produces similar output with just 128 robotic arms
and a handful of human operators . According to a report, those 128 robots in the Dutch plant can
do the work of hundreds of Chinese workers  assembling shavers, and the fully automated line could “get
by on a few dozen workers” total . In effect, automation allowed Philips to reshore production from
low-wage labor markets by drastically cutting the labor needed – the optimal number of employees for that
high-tech factory was only a tiny fraction of what the same output would require in a traditional setup. 
Similarly, automotive manufacturing , traditionally a huge employer , has seen robots take over many tasks
like welding, painting, and parts handling. It’s not uncommon now to see automotive plants where  one
robot replaces four to six human welders or handlers  on certain processes. A high-profile revelation
came  from  Goldman  Sachs  (an  interesting  cross-sector  example  in  finance  manufacturing  crossover):
Goldman’s CIO noted that on their trading floors, they found  “four traders can be replaced by one
computer engineer”  when they automated trading workflows . In automotive factories, one might
analogously say multiple line workers can be replaced by one maintenance engineer overseeing the robotic
cells. 
According to a Gartner study, by 2025 as many as 60% of manufacturers will have at least two “lights-
out” automated processes  in their plants . This doesn’t mean whole factories with zero people are the
norm – rather , portions of the production (certain machining cells, assembly steps, or material handling
tasks) will run unattended. But it shows the direction: more segments of the factory are going dark, so to
speak. A recent industry article described “ambitious expectations” for lights-out production, noting that
manufacturers are incrementally pursuing fully automated steps where feasible, even if a complete lights-
out factory end-to-end may be rare in the near term . 
Indeed,  strategy is often to start with “lights-sparse” operations  – automating specific processes or
shifts – rather than jump to 100% automation overnight . For example, a plant might run with
normal staff by day, then run an automated second or third shift at night with minimal crew. Even such3334

partial automation can significantly cut the total number of workers required (and extend production hours
without adding full shifts of new hires). 
Labor Cost Benefits and Case Studies
The  primary  benefit  driving  automation  in  manufacturing  is  labor  cost  reduction .  Every  robot  or
automated station can eliminate one or several jobs, saving on wages. A concrete case:  JD.com’s fully
automated warehouse in China . JD.com (a large e-commerce retailer) built a 3,700 m^2 fulfillment center
that is a showcase of lights-out automation. It employs just 5 human technicians to oversee 20 robots ,
instead of the roughly  500 workers a conventional warehouse that size would require . This is a
100:1 reduction  in headcount for similar throughput . The robots, including autonomous mobile robots
and  robotic  arms,  handle  sorting,  packaging,  and  material  transport.  The  few  humans  on  site  are
maintenance techs ensuring the system runs smoothly. The labor cost savings here are enormous – 5
salaries versus 500 – and while there is significant capital cost in deploying such robots, JD.com calculates
the ROI in terms of speed and accuracy gains during China’s massive shopping events (where human labor
might even be insufficient to handle peak volumes). 
In  general,  for  manufacturers:  fewer  workers  means  lower  direct  labor  costs,  but  also  secondary
savings .  There’s  reduced  spending  on  employee-related  costs  like  insurance,  pensions,  cafeterias,  etc.
Additionally, a highly automated plant can sometimes be more compact or use space more efficiently (no
need for aisles for people, or lighting/heating in unused areas at night, etc.), saving facility costs. For
instance, the concept of the dark factory includes the side benefit of saving on lighting and climate control
when humans aren’t present . These are relatively minor compared to labor savings, but every bit
contributes to efficiency.
Beyond cost, manufacturers cite  quality improvements  as a major benefit of automation. Automated
processes often have lower defect rates  than manual ones . For example, electronic assembly by robots
leads to more consistent soldering than by hand, reducing rework and warranty claims. This quality edge is
one reason even manufacturers in low-wage countries like China are automating: it’s not just about wages,
but also producing higher-end products with fewer flaws. A Chinese news report on the rise of “dark
factories”  noted  that  companies  like  Foxconn  and  BYD  are  aggressively  automating  to  improve
efficiency and quality . Foxconn, as mentioned, replaced 60,000 workers with robots in a single factory
(in  Kunshan  in  2016)  and  set  a  goal  to  automate  30%  of  its  entire  production  by  2025 .  BYD  (an
automaker and electronics manufacturer) uses advanced robotic systems for tasks like EV battery assembly
to ensure precision and throughput that would be hard to achieve with manual labor . China’s national
strategy  (“Made  in  China  2025”)  explicitly  pushes  companies  toward  smart  factories  with  generous
subsidies, and as a result  robot installations in China have surged , making it the world’s largest robot
market (290,000+ robots installed in 2022, more than the U.S. and Japan’s installations combined that year ).
The robot density in China’s manufacturing jumped to 392 per 10,000 workers by 2023 , well above the
global average . This indicates a rapid reduction of reliance on human workers on Chinese factory floors
within just a decade. The economic rationale is clear: even though Chinese labor is cheaper than Western
labor , it is no longer as cheap as robots on a per-task basis for many operations, and robots deliver quality
and productivity benefits vital for competing in technology-heavy industries.
Let’s  consider  a  counterpart  in  a  developed  economy :  the  United  States.  While  U.S.  manufacturing
employment  dropped,  output  rose,  thanks  to  heavy  automation  in  sectors  like  autos,  chemicals,  and
electronics.  General Motors (GM)  in the 1970s employed over 600,000 people; today it employs under44

200,000, yet produces a similar number of vehicles (global output) – a stark illustration of fewer humans
needed per car . Many of those jobs were lost to a combination of robots and outsourcing, but the trend
within  remaining  U.S.  plants  is  clear:  robot  density  in  U.S.  manufacturing  reached  274  per  10,000
workers  by  2020  and  continues  to  climb .  A  specific  example:  Tesla’s  manufacturing .  Tesla
attempted to create one of the most automated auto assembly lines ever for its Model 3 around 2017–2018,
with CEO Elon Musk initially pushing for an “alien dreadnought” factory with extremely high automation.
While Tesla discovered some limits (Musk admitted “excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake... Humans are
underrated”  after  over-automating  certain  processes ),  Tesla’s  factories  still  feature  cutting-edge
automation in body assembly, painting, and parts conveyance. They learned that some tasks (particularly
final assembly of many small components) were actually more efficiently done with human flexibility – a
valuable lesson that 100% automation can backfire if applied without careful consideration. Musk’s remark
came  after  Tesla  realized  a  complex  automated  conveyor  system  was  performing  worse  than  human
workers, leading them to rip it out and simplify the process . This case shows that while the goal  might
be minimal employees, practical reality sometimes intervenes; we will discuss such limits later . But notably,
even after dialing back some automation, Tesla’s production per employee is far above traditional norms,
meaning they still benefitted from a high degree of automation overall.
Another manufacturing case study involves “microfactories” and new business models . Companies like
Arrival (electric vehicles) and various startup fabricators talk of microfactories that are highly automated,
small-scale production sites . These rely on automation and digital workflows to achieve efficiency at low
volumes, with far fewer staff than a conventional large factory would need for equivalent output. While
many microfactory concepts are nascent, the promise is that a small automated line with, say, 10 people
and several robots could do what might historically have taken 100+ people in a larger facility .
Manufacturers are also exploring subscription models for automation equipment  – essentially “robots as
a  service”  –  which  can  lower  the  capital  barrier  and  make  it  easier  to  replace  labor  with  on-demand
automated solutions .
The Lights-Out Horizon and Future Outlook
Looking forward 5–10 years, manufacturing is poised to push automation even further .  AI and machine
learning  are being integrated for more adaptive robots – ones that can handle some level of variability (e.g.
recognizing  different  parts  or  making  minor  assembly  decisions)  which  currently  still  require  humans.
Collaborative robots (cobots)  are becoming common – these are robots safe to work alongside humans,
often used to take over the heavy or repetitive aspects of an assemblers’ tasks. While cobots  augment
humans rather than replace them entirely, they do improve labor productivity and can reduce the number
of workers needed on a line by handling, for instance, two persons’ worth of work with one person
overseeing . Over time, if one technician can manage a cell of multiple cobots, that again reduces
headcount.
Advances in  machine vision and gripping technology  mean robots can do more intricate tasks (like
handling deformable objects or performing complex assembly that once only dexterous humans could).
The continued development of additive manufacturing  might eliminate some assembly steps altogether
by printing more complete components, bypassing labor-intensive sub-assembly stages . The push for
digital twins and fully simulated production scheduling  means factories could run largely autonomously
with AI optimizing throughput and maintenance schedules without human planners.2950

According to one survey, manufacturers expect that by  2030 a significant share of factories will be
“smart factories”  with very limited direct labor . Many foresee at least pilot lights-out lines in their facilities.
And as mentioned, Gartner predicted that by 2025 a majority of manufacturers (60%) will have at least a
couple fully autonomous processes in place . These might be cells that run completely independent of
humans for stretches. This incremental approach suggests that, year by year ,  the pockets of human-less
production expand . 
However , even by 2030, it’s unlikely that most factories will be literally empty of workers. Rather , the role of
humans will continue shifting  toward oversight, programming, and maintenance. The “optimal” number
of employees may not be zero in practice, but it will be far fewer and more highly skilled  than in decades
past. For example, a future auto plant might have one-tenth the assembly workers of a 1990 plant, but
twice as many software technicians and robot maintenance staff. Still, the net effect is significantly reduced
total headcount. One estimate from the International Federation of Robotics posits that for each industrial
robot added to production, several jobs are reconfigured or eliminated, although new tech jobs are created
as well – but the tech jobs are fewer in number . We have already seen heavy job losses in routine production
roles, and that will continue. 
In  summary,  manufacturing  illustrates  the  trajectory:  automation  has  enabled  massive  productivity
gains with fewer workers , and firms will keep pushing that boundary. Fully “dark” factories are rare (and
not always cost-effective yet, as Tesla learned), but selective lights-out operations are growing. From a
business perspective, the economic rationale – reduced labor cost, higher output, better quality – means
the  question  isn’t  if more  jobs  in  manufacturing  will  be  automated,  but  how  quickly .  The  equilibrium
workforce in manufacturing companies is likely to keep shrinking relative to output. In an ideal state where
technology truly handles all production and self-maintenance, the optimal direct production workforce
would indeed be zero, with just a remote team managing algorithms and machinery. Whether that ideal will
be achieved in 10, 20, or 50 years varies by industry segment, but each step closer yields real financial
gains, which is why companies are aggressively pursuing automation. 
Before leaving manufacturing, it’s worth noting that  human flexibility and creativity  still play a role in
many production environments, especially where products change frequently or processes haven’t been
fully  codified.  As  one  manufacturing  expert  put  it,  “Human  intervention  remains  the  most  efficient  and
economical way to implement production changes in a significant majority of cases” . People are generalists
who can adapt on the fly, whereas most automation is good at specific repetitive tasks. Thus, in high-mix,
low-volume manufacturing, the optimal number of humans may not drop to zero for a long time – it may
even be higher than in a stable high-volume factory, because constant changeover benefits from human
workers’ adaptability . We will revisit such limits in the counterexamples section. But where volume is
high and tasks are routine, the drive to lights-out will be strongest. 
Now, we turn to logistics , a sector related to manufacturing in that it deals with moving physical goods, but
encompassing  warehousing  and  transportation  where  a  different  kind  of  automation  revolution  is
underway.
Logistics and Warehousing: Automating the Supply Chain
Logistics – which includes warehousing, distribution, and transportation of goods – is another arena where
automation is dramatically reducing the need for human labor . Traditionally, this sector has employed
millions  worldwide  in  roles  like  warehouse  picking  and  packing,  driving  trucks,  sorting  packages,  and40
56

delivering goods. But with the rise of e-commerce and the demand for ever-faster fulfillment, logistics
companies have turned to automation to boost speed and cut costs.  Automated warehouses ,  robotic
material handling , and  autonomous vehicles  are transforming how goods are stored and moved. The
long-term vision is a  supply chain with minimal human intervention : goods flowing from factories to
warehouses to stores or end-customers through mostly self-operating systems.
Automated Warehouses and Distribution Centers
Warehousing has seen some of the most visible automation gains in recent years. In large e-commerce
fulfillment  centers,  armies  of  robots  now  assist  or  replace  human  pickers  and  sorters.  For  example,
Amazon , the world’s largest e-commerce player , has massively invested in warehouse automation since
acquiring Kiva Systems in 2012. Amazon’s signature orange  Kiva robots (now Amazon Robotics drive
units)  zip around warehouses, carrying shelves of products to stationary human pickers, saving workers
from walking miles of aisles. This was just the start – Amazon has continually expanded its robotic fleet. By
2023, Amazon reported over 750,000 robots working in its fulfillment and sortation centers . This is a
staggering number , considering it had about 1,000 robots in 2013 and 45,000 by 2016 . The robot fleet
grew roughly 750-fold in a decade . These include not just mobile drive units, but also robotic arms for
sorting (like the “Sparrow” robotic arm that can pick individual items) , robotic palletizers, and even
autonomous forklifts. Amazon claims these robots work “collaboratively with our employees, taking on highly
repetitive tasks and freeing employees up to better deliver for customers” . The phrasing is diplomatic, but
the net effect is each worker can handle far more throughput with robotic assistance – meaning Amazon
doesn’t need to hire as many new people to meet growing demand as it would have otherwise. One
estimate by Morgan Stanley suggested Amazon’s robotics could save the company about $10 billion a year
by 2030  in operational costs .
Other companies similarly have built  highly automated warehouses .  JD.com’s 5-technician, 20-robot
warehouse  we mentioned in manufacturing is essentially a logistics center – it handles fulfillment of e-
commerce orders with minimal staff . In that facility, robots handle everything from picking items to
sorting packages, achieving throughput that would normally require hundreds of pickers, packers, and
loaders. 
Another famed example is Ocado , a UK online grocery company, which operates technologically advanced
fulfillment centers. Ocado’s system uses swarms of robots on a grid (“hive” system) to assemble grocery
orders. It’s reported that at Ocado’s Andover warehouse,  thousands of robots can together process
around 65,000 orders a week  – a level of activity that would be impractical with human pickers alone .
The robots in Ocado’s grid can pick a 50-item grocery order in about 5 minutes , something that would take
a human shopper much longer . Ocado’s model essentially eliminates the traditional supermarket stock
clerk or shelf picker role for fulfilling online orders; instead, a few technicians oversee the robotic grid. The
efficiency gains are huge, enabling Ocado to handle high order volumes with relatively few staff on site
(mainly maintenance and quality assurance personnel).
Automated sorting centers  in parcel delivery are another illustration. Companies like DHL, FedEx, UPS,
and China’s SF Express use high-speed sorting machines that scan barcodes and direct packages down
chutes, replacing what used to be rows of workers routing parcels. These systems, often coupled with
robotic arms for loading, can sort tens of thousands of parcels per hour with minimal human touch.
Conveyor systems and packet sorters  guided by computer vision have significantly reduced the number
of workers needed in hub facilities.58

In many modern warehouses, humans are increasingly only at the ends of the process  – e.g., unloading
inbound  goods  and  loading  outbound  trucks  –  and  even  those  tasks  are  becoming  automated.
Autonomous mobile robots  (AMRs) can unload trailers, and robotic arms with grippers can depalletize and
palletize goods. For instance, Boston Dynamics (known for its robots) has a robot called “Stretch” that is
designed to unload boxes from trucks automatically. Over the next decade, these kinds of unloading/
loading robots could reduce or eliminate the need for teams of warehouse lumpers (manual unloaders).
The economic benefits of warehouse automation are clear: labor in warehouses is often one of the highest
operating costs. Using robots can cut the per-order fulfillment cost significantly, especially as order volumes
grow. Additionally, automated systems can often run continuously and at a steady pace , unlike human
workers who may slow when tired or make errors. Automation improves throughput consistency and can
meet peak demands (e.g., holiday rush) by simply running more hours or scaling up systems, rather than
hiring huge numbers of seasonal workers. Amazon, for example, still hires many seasonal workers, but it
also simply cranks its warehouses to 24/7 operation with robots carrying much of the additional load.
One metric often cited is  orders per employee . Traditional warehouses might fulfill, say, 50 orders per
employee per hour (depending on complexity). Highly automated ones can boost that far higher . With
systems like Ocado’s, each human supervisor might oversee machines that together handle hundreds of
orders per hour . In JD.com’s case,  one human technician oversees what 100 human pickers would
normally do . This massive productivity leap is why companies invest heavily in these systems despite
the capital expense.
Autonomous Transportation: Trucks, Drones, and More
The logistics sector is not just about warehouses – transportation (moving goods between locations) is
equally critical. Here, too, the  “optimal” number of drivers or operators is trending down thanks to
automation . The advent of autonomous vehicles  poses the possibility that trucks, delivery vans, and even
ships could operate with few or no crew.
Self-driving trucks  are a major focus, given the high cost of truck drivers and driver shortages in many
countries.  Several  companies  (Waymo  Via,  TuSimple,  Aurora,  etc.)  have  been  testing  autonomous
semitrucks on highways. In late 2021, TuSimple announced it had completed a fully driverless semi-truck
run on public roads in Arizona (with no human in the vehicle). The vision for the next 5–10 years is that
highway stretches of trucking routes could be done autonomously , with drivers only needed for first-
mile and last-mile navigation or in remote command centers. If this materializes, a single human might
remotely oversee a convoy or a fleet of trucks, multiplying their productivity. Even if one human supervises
5–10 trucks, that’s an 80–90% reduction in drivers needed for those routes. Long-haul trucking, which is
relatively structured (highway driving), is seen as one of the earliest economically viable use-cases for
vehicle automation in logistics.
Platooning  is another concept – where one lead truck with a driver is followed closely by one or more
driverless follower trucks electronically tethered. This could reduce the number of drivers per convoy,
saving labor (and fuel via drafting). Some trials in Europe have shown platooning of two or three trucks can
work, cutting drivers by 50–66% for those loads.
In last-mile delivery , companies are experimenting with delivery robots and drones. Small delivery robots
on sidewalks  (like those by Starship Technologies) can carry parcels or food to customers in a limited44
13
radius, eliminating the need for human couriers for those deliveries. Several cities and campuses have
these robots in operation. They are slower and limited, but they operate continuously and at lower cost than
paying a person for each delivery, especially for small items. Delivery drones  have been tested by Amazon
(Prime Air) and others to drop small packages at homes, bypassing drivers entirely. While regulatory and
safety hurdles mean drone delivery isn’t widespread yet, the technology exists and in the coming years
could handle a niche of lightweight, urgent deliveries without human involvement.
Even rail and ports  are seeing automation. Many modern metro trains already run without drivers, and in
freight, automated trains and drone ships  (autonomous cargo vessels) are being piloted. Automated port
cranes and yard vehicles in port terminals (like in Rotterdam or Qingdao) have dramatically reduced the
dockworkers  needed  to  unload  containers.  For  example,  at  some  automated  container  terminals,  the
cranes and straddle carriers are run by software with just a few humans supervising from a control room,
versus hundreds of longshoremen in a traditional port operation.
All these transportation automations point to a future where  fewer drivers, pilots, or operators are
needed . Given that transportation jobs (truck drivers, delivery drivers) number in the millions globally, the
economic incentive to automate is huge: labor is a big portion of logistics cost, and removing it can improve
margins or allow lower prices. Also, automated vehicles could potentially operate more hours (truck drivers
are  limited  by  hours-of-service  laws  for  safety;  a  robot  truck  could  drive  overnight  without  fatigue,
potentially doubling daily range). 
Case Study: A Fully Automated Logistics Chain
It’s illustrative to imagine a product moving from factory to customer in a near-future scenario leveraging
maximal automation: 
A widget is manufactured in a lights-out factory  (as discussed, minimal staff). It’s packaged and moved by
AGVs  to an outbound dock. An autonomous truck  collects the shipment – perhaps a human driver brings
it from the factory to the highway, then engages autopilot mode for the long haul. Arriving at a distribution
center , the truck is unloaded by robotic unloaders . Inside the automated distribution center , conveyor
belts and robotic sorters  route the widget to the correct outbound bin. A robotic arm  picks the package
and places it onto a last-mile delivery robot or into a locker . Finally, a  delivery drone or sidewalk robot
carries it to the customer’s doorstep. In this chain, the only human involvement might have been at the very
start or end (and even those could be engineered out). We are not fully there yet, but each link in this chain
is being developed. 
Some parts are already reality: the automated warehouse of JD.com or Amazon, for instance, combined with
early trials of autonomous line-haul trucks (e.g., Waymo’s autonomous trucks doing freight runs in Texas).
It’s plausible that in 5–10 years, many main distribution centers will run with a fraction of today’s workforce,
relying on automation. Gartner predicted that by mid-2020s, 50%+ of supply chain organizations will invest
in AI and robotics to augment and automate their operations, aiming to handle growing e-commerce
volumes without commensurate headcount growth. 
Impact on Employment and Efficiency
The employment impact in logistics  is already evident. Each robotic system installed can displace multiple
workers. Amazon’s 750k warehouse robots haven’t led to layoffs per se – Amazon actually kept hiring more
14
people due to explosive growth – but they have  changed the work and likely prevented even larger
hiring . Amazon’s sales and volume roughly quadrupled in a recent five-year span, but its human fulfillment
workforce didn’t quadruple, in part because automation boosted each worker’s productivity. Going forward,
as Amazon’s growth stabilizes, it may rely more on robots and less on adding people, implying eventually a
plateau or decline in warehouse employment even as output rises.
Other  companies  might  use  automation  explicitly  to  reduce  headcount.  For  instance,  DHL  has  been
implementing autonomous tuggers and pallet movers in some warehouses, allowing them to operate with
fewer forklift drivers. They cite not only cost but also safety (robots don’t get injured or cause accidents as
often as humans might). 
One interesting dynamic is  labor shortages driving automation adoption . In many economies, finding
warehouse workers or truck drivers is getting harder due to aging demographics or low unemployment.
Rather than raise wages indefinitely, firms invest in automation. This happened in Japan early on – facing a
shortage of young workers, Japanese firms were pioneers in robotic warehouses and automated guided
vehicles. In the U.S. and Europe now, a shortage of truck drivers is one factor accelerating the push for
autonomous trucks. So ironically, even without a pure cost rationale, a lack of available employees makes a
zero-employee solution attractive.
In terms of efficiency, automated logistics systems can significantly cut delivery times and increase capacity.
Material  handling  efficiencies  from  lights-out  tech  can  shorten  dwell  times  between  steps,  reduce
inventory idle time, and raise throughput . For example, an automated retrieval system can bring items
to  packing  stations  faster  than  a  human  runner ,  thus  orders  get  out  the  door  quicker .  In  inventory
management,  robots  and  AI  can  cycle-count  (verify  stock)  continuously,  eliminating  manual  inventory
checks and ensuring better stock accuracy – all with fewer staff. 
Future Projections (5–10 years) in Logistics
By the late 2020s, we can expect: 
Many more warehouses will be heavily automated.  The cost of robots is coming down, and their
capabilities (like handling more varied items) are improving. Even mid-sized warehouses will likely
use  some  robotics.  “Dark  warehouses”  (operating  with  lights  out)  could  become  common  for
standardized goods. Analysts forecast the warehouse automation market to grow robustly, reaching
tens of billions of dollars, as firms invest to keep up with Amazon and others.
Emergence of fully driverless trucks in specific corridors.  Companies like Aurora and TuSimple
aim  for  commercial  deployment  of  self-driving  trucks  on  highways  by  around  2025–2026.  If
regulatory approvals come through, within 10 years we could see autonomous trucks handling a
meaningful  portion  of  highway  miles  in  the  Sunbelt  states  (which  have  favorable  weather  and
regulations). This might mean truck stops where a human driver hands off a load to a driverless unit
for the highway leg. It won’t wipe out truck driving jobs overnight, but could trim the demand
growth. The ultimate aim would be driverless end-to-end for highway routes – perhaps in dedicated
lanes or times of day.
Last-mile automation will expand in niche areas.  Delivery robots might become a fixture on
university campuses, corporate parks, and suburban neighborhoods with suitable infrastructure.64

Drones might service rural or difficult areas where they make more sense than driving. While it’s
unlikely that all mail carriers or couriers get replaced in 5–10 years, certain repetitive routes or on-
demand deliveries might be handed off to robots, reducing the number of van drivers or bike
messengers needed. Companies like FedEx have tested a delivery robot (“Roxo”) for short-distance
deliveries from local stores to customers.
Port and air cargo automation  will continue to grow. More ports will adopt automated cranes and
guided vehicles (following examples in Rotterdam, Singapore, etc.), which can cut longshore labor .
Air cargo warehouses may use robotic sorting and container loading systems, reducing ground
crews.
Overall, the logistics workforce may see a shift similar to manufacturing’s : fewer front-line handlers and
drivers, more technicians and managers of automated systems. A McKinsey study of automation potential
found  “Transportation  and  warehousing”  had  a  high  technical  automation  potential,  estimated
around 60% of tasks could be automated with known technology . This includes driving (predictable
highway driving is easier to automate than chaotic city driving) and warehouse operations (many of which
are predictable physical activities – lifting, moving, sorting – prime for robots). Indeed, McKinsey’s analysis
ranked sectors like  transportation and warehousing among those with above-average automation
feasibility , trailing only sectors like accommodation/food services and manufacturing in overall potential
.  This  suggests  that  the  equilibrium  employment  in  logistics  could  decline  substantially  as  those
technologies roll out.
One counterpoint is that the volume of throughput in logistics is rising (due to e-commerce growth, etc.), so
companies might automate just to handle more volume with the same or slightly fewer workers, rather
than massive layoffs. But if volume growth slows, then headcount could fall. For instance, if Amazon’s retail
growth levels off, they may start optimizing to cut labor – something already signaled by their investments
in robots that replace  tasks traditionally done by people (like the Sparrow arm for item picking, intended to
eventually handle items that humans currently pick) .
In conclusion, in logistics the  business rationale for automation  is very straightforward: it lowers labor
cost, increases speed, and can alleviate labor shortages. Warehouses are becoming “employee-light” if not
fully employee-free  in some cases. Transportation may not hit “zero drivers” within 10 years everywhere,
but likely far fewer drivers will be needed for the same freight task on certain routes. If the hypothesis is the
optimal number of employees tends toward zero, logistics is clearly moving along that trajectory – not as far
along as manufacturing perhaps, but steadily advancing. 
Next, we will examine the broad services sector , which includes a wide range of jobs from hospitality and
retail  services  to  back-office  administration  and  professional  services.  This  is  a  more  heterogeneous
category, but one where automation (especially through software and AI) is beginning to make similar
inroads in reducing human labor needs.
Services Sector Automation: Hospitality, Food Service, and
Administrative Work
The  “services”  sector  is  broad,  encompassing  everything  from  restaurants  and  hotels  to  call  centers,
administrative offices, and professional services. Historically, services have been more labor-intensive and• 
65
65
6066
16
slower to automate than manufacturing, since they often involve direct human interaction or complex, non-
repetitive tasks. However , the march of automation – particularly AI, software automation, and robotics
designed for service environments  – is increasingly affecting these jobs as well. Businesses in service
industries are embracing technologies like self-service kiosks, chatbots, robotic process automation, and
even physical service robots to streamline operations and cut labor costs. While the nature of work in
services is diverse, a common theme is emerging: companies try to offload simpler, routine service tasks
to machines or customers (via self-service), thereby requiring fewer employees to deliver the service .
We can break this discussion into a couple of sub-areas:  Hospitality and food service  (where physical
robots and kiosks are making headway) and  clerical/professional services  (where software automation
and AI handle tasks once done by office workers or support staff).
Hospitality and Food Service: From Self-Order to Robot Chefs
Food service (restaurants, fast food)  has traditionally been very labor-heavy – cooks, cashiers, servers,
cleaners. But due to slim margins, this industry has a strong drive to reduce labor costs, which can be 20–
30% of revenues. In recent years, many restaurants have introduced  self-service ordering kiosks and
apps , which effectively automate the cashier/order-taker role and let customers input orders themselves.
Major fast-food chains like McDonald’s, Burger King, Panera, and others have installed ordering kiosks
worldwide. These kiosks mean that instead of 4 cashiers on shift, maybe 1 roving assistant is needed to help
customers use the machines, cutting down on front-counter staff. As early as 2016, McDonald’s former US
CEO Ed Rensi warned that a higher minimum wage would accelerate such automation, explicitly saying “it’s
cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than hire a $15/hour employee”  for tasks like bagging fries .
Indeed, McDonald’s and others have since not only rolled out kiosks but also are piloting  automated
kitchen equipment .
One headline-grabbing example is the emergence of what might be the world’s first fully automated fast-
food restaurant . In late 2023, a restaurant called “CaliBurger / CaliGroup’s CaliBurger”  (operated by Miso
Robotics) in Pasadena, CA, opened as an almost entirely robotic burger joint. Customers order and pay via
self-serve kiosks , then can watch through a window as robots prepare the meal . The kitchen
features Miso Robotics’ machines: a robot named “Flippy” for the grill and fryer (a robotic arm that cooks
burgers and fries), an automated beverage dispenser , and conveyor systems. According to reports, this
location – called CaliBurger’s “CaliBurger 2.0” or “CaliBurger Pasadena”  – is believed to be the first fully
autonomous restaurant  of its kind . Humans are only present in a very limited capacity, perhaps to restock
ingredients or take care of maintenance, but not for direct cooking or cash handling. The owners claim it
improves safety (e.g., no humans around hot oil) and reduces food waste (precise automated cooking) .
Essentially, a job that would typically require, say, 3–5 kitchen staff and 1–2 cashiers can be done with
possibly 1 overseer or just remote monitoring. 
Another pioneer was Spyce , a robotic kitchen in Boston opened by MIT graduates, which featured a fully
automated wok line  that cooked stir-fry meals. Customers ordered via a kiosk, and the system portioned
ingredients,  tumbled  them  in  heated  induction-wok  drums,  and  dispensed  into  bowls.  Humans  only
garnished and handed over the final product (and cleaned). Spyce later got acquired and integrated into
Sweetgreen (a salad chain) to automate salad production. Yet another is Creator  in San Francisco, which
built a machine that could grind meat, form patties, toast buns, assemble and wrap a gourmet burger to
order – essentially a burger assembly robot visible behind a glass case. Creator employed a couple of
people mainly to load ingredients and welcome guests, but the cooking and assembly of the burger were1
6768
67
68
17
done by a  22-foot-long automated contraption . These examples indicate that  kitchen automation  is
technically feasible and can replace multiple roles (grill cook, assembler , etc.). 
Large chains are also in the game. White Castle  tested Flippy robots for frying. Chipotle  is testing a robot
named  “Chippy”  to  make  tortilla  chips.  Domino’s  has  tested  robotic  pizza  assembly  lines  and  even
autonomous  pizza  delivery  vehicles.  Starbucks  introduced  automated  espresso  machines  long  ago
(improving barista productivity) and more recently is experimenting with AI drive-thru voice ordering to
reduce staff needed for order taking.
The business incentives  in food service are straightforward: reduce labor costs and improve consistency. A
robot burger flipper might replace 1-2 line cooks and can work continuously without breaks, yielding more
output per hour . There is also a marketing angle – some customers are drawn to the novelty of robot-
prepared food. However , these are early days. For now, fully automated restaurants are niche. But self-
ordering  kiosks  and  partially  automated  kitchens  are  becoming  mainstream.  We  may  see  labor-light
restaurants  proliferate, where a skeleton crew (maybe one manager and one maintenance person) can run
what used to need a dozen staff, thanks to automation of cooking and service. 
In  hospitality (hotels) , automation has taken the form of self-service and robotics in certain functions.
Many hotels now offer mobile check-in and check-out, where a guest can use an app or kiosk to get a room
key,  bypassing  the  front  desk  staff.  This  reduces  the  number  of  clerks  needed.  Some  hotels  have
experimented with  robot concierges or delivery bots . For instance, some hotels use small robots to
deliver room service orders or amenities to guests’ rooms, navigating the elevators autonomously. This can
save bellhop or runner labor . 
A famous, albeit cautionary, example was Japan’s  Henn-na Hotel , billed as the world’s first robot-staffed
hotel. Upon opening, it featured robot receptionists (even dinosaur-shaped androids), robotic cloakroom
arm, and robot porters. Initially, they had over  240 robots handling various tasks  and minimal human
staff. However , over time they discovered many robots were not efficient – they often required human
intervention or annoyed guests. Eventually, Henn-na Hotel “fired” over half of its 243 robots  because they
created more problems than they solved . For example, the robot assistants in rooms misunderstood
snoring as voice commands and woke guests up, the robot luggage carriers could not handle outdoor
paths,  etc. .  The  hotel  had  to  bring  back  more  human  staff  to  maintain  service  quality.  This  case
underscores that automating service roles that involve nuanced customer interaction can be tricky; the tech
might not be fully ready. Nonetheless, it was a bold attempt at a near-zero-employee hospitality model, and
even though it scaled back, it demonstrated what is technically possible. Future iterations with better AI
might succeed where the early robots failed. 
Despite Henn-na’s experience, many hotels quietly use automation behind the scenes – e.g., AI scheduling
software, service request chatbots for guests (instead of calling reception, you message a bot for extra
towels), and automated energy management in rooms (sensors to control HVAC). These don’t eliminate
front-line jobs entirely but can reduce workload and staffing needs.
Retail service  overlaps with hospitality and will be discussed more in the retail section, but one can note
here:  in  convenience  and  retail,  unattended  stores  (like  Amazon  Go’s  cashierless  stores,  or  vending
machine-style automated shops) aim to provide retail service (shopping) with effectively no staff on site.6970

Office and Administrative Services: RPA and AI Replacing Back-Office Workers
A vast number of service sector employees work in offices performing administrative, support, or analytical
tasks – processing paperwork, answering routine inquiries, scheduling, bookkeeping, etc. Here, software
automation  and  AI  are  the  tools  reducing  needed  headcount.  One  major  trend  is  Robotic  Process
Automation (RPA)  – essentially software “bots” that mimic human clicks and keystrokes to handle repetitive
digital tasks in finance, HR, or customer support processes. Companies have been adopting RPA to, for
example, automatically transfer data from one system to another , generate reports, or validate forms, tasks
that might have occupied whole teams of clerks previously. A bank, for instance, might use RPA bots to
process loan applications overnight, cutting down on back-office staff overtime. Insurers deploy RPA to
handle claims routing and initial assessments, reducing the burden on claims adjusters.
The benefit is not just cost but speed and error reduction. A bot can work 24/7 and doesn’t make typos.
Thus a single bot might do the work of 2-3 full-time employees when running non-stop, which directly
translates to a smaller team needed for that workflow. Surveys by Deloitte and others have indicated that
the vast majority of large enterprises either have implemented RPA or plan to, often seeing ROI in less than
a year .
Customer service and call centers  are also being automated through AI chatbots and voice assistants.
Companies now commonly have AI-driven chat interfaces on their websites or phone lines that handle
many customer queries without a human agent. For example, Bank of America’s “Erica” chatbot  handles
millions of customer queries about account info, transfers, or common questions, reducing the call volume
to human reps. Similar AI assistants in telecom or retail can answer questions and even complete simple
transactions (like resetting a password or checking an order status). Each interaction handled by AI is one
less that a paid employee must do. Over time, as natural language processing improves, these AI agents
can resolve more complex issues. Some estimates claim that AI could handle up to 70-80% of routine
customer inquiries, leaving only specialized or angry-customer cases to humans. This could significantly cut
the number of call center agents needed, or at least allow companies to scale support without equivalent
hiring.
Virtual  assistants  and  scheduling  bots  can  replace  administrative  assistant  tasks.  Software  can  now
schedule meetings (finding mutually free times by scanning calendars), manage email filtering, or even
draft routine communications. Firms like x.ai had AI schedulers that do the email back-and-forth of finding
a meeting time. Microsoft and Google incorporate AI features in their office suites to automate tasks like
replying to emails, summarizing documents, etc., which means a single manager might not need a personal
assistant for routine duties the way they used to.
In more skilled professional services, AI is encroaching on tasks of junior analysts or researchers . For
example, in the legal field, e-discovery software can comb through thousands of documents for relevant
terms, a job that used to require an army of paralegals. AI legal research tools (like IBM’s discontinued Ross
or newer GPT-based tools) can answer legal questions or draft memos, potentially reducing the number of
entry-level lawyers needed for research tasks. In accounting, automated accounting software and AI can
categorize transactions, detect anomalies, and even compile draft financial statements, meaning fewer
bookkeepers. In consulting or finance, data analysis that once took a team using Excel might be accelerated
by AI-driven analytics platforms.
19
Even  software development , ironically, is seeing automation through AI code generation (Copilot, etc.)
which may allow smaller engineering teams to produce the same output – though this might reduce the
optimal  number of programmers needed for a project.
From the business perspective, the rationale is similar: these tools allow the same volume of work with
fewer personnel, or allow each employee to handle a larger scope of work. They also often provide faster
turnaround (an AI can retrieve info in seconds that a person might in hours). Companies aim to streamline
their  back  offices  –  in  banking,  insurance,  healthcare  administration,  etc.  –  through  digital
transformation , which often means automating manual workflows. A McKinsey study noted that sectors
like finance and insurance have a high percentage of work that is routine data processing , which is
highly automatable . For instance, processing insurance claims or mortgage applications involves
checking documents, verifying information, applying rules – tasks well-suited to RPA or AI. Thus, while these
industries  won’t  go  to  zero  employees  (they  still  need  decision-makers,  experts,  and  those  providing
personalized service), they could see a major thinning of the rank-and-file processing staff.
To quantify, one analysis suggested that in sectors like  accommodation/food services ,  up to 73% of
activities could be automated  (the highest among all sectors)  – we saw this with fast food and hotel
check-ins.  Manufacturing and agriculture  were next highest in potential (which we discussed) . But
notably,  “finance and insurance” had an automation potential estimated around 50%  of tasks, and
“administrative and support services”  similarly high . Meanwhile, healthcare and education  were on
the lower end (we’ll get to those later) . This means large swathes of service-sector tasks, especially
those that are routine, are poised for automation.
Case Studies and Evidence in Services
ATMs vs. Bank Tellers : A classic example often cited by economists (James Bessen, David Autor) is
the introduction of ATMs in banking. One might expect that ATMs (Automated Teller Machines)
would  eliminate  bank  teller  jobs,  since  ATMs  can  handle  cash  withdrawals  and  deposits.
Interestingly, teller employment did not immediately plummet; in fact, the number of bank tellers in
the U.S. actually increased  from the 1970s through the 2000s before eventually peaking and declining
slightly . What happened was ATMs reduced the number of tellers needed per branch (from
an average of 21 tellers to about 13 tellers per urban branch in the early ATM era) . This made
branches cheaper to operate, so banks opened more branches to better serve customers (especially
after deregulation) . The increase in branches roughly offset the reduction of tellers per branch,
so total teller numbers held steady or even grew for a while . This is often cited as an “automation
paradox” where labor-saving tech didn’t cut total jobs because of expansion effects . However ,
this was not the end of the story – eventually, banking did start consolidating branches and teller
numbers declined in the 2010s as online banking took over . Teller employment in the U.S. peaked
around  2007 at over 600,000, then fell to ~500,000 by late 2010s . So in the long run, fewer
tellers are needed; the ATM allowed one teller to do more (focus on sales or complex services while
machines did routine cash work). Today, many bank locations have just 1–2 tellers with ATMs doing a
lot of the transaction volume. Furthermore, banks are now pushing even more digital self-service
(mobile apps, automated phone systems, and now AI chatbots for customer service). The net effect
is fewer employees in routine service roles like tellers or call agents. For instance, Bank of America’s
AI chatbot “Erica” reached over 1 billion interactions, performing tasks that otherwise would likely
have required call center time or branch visits – a sizable labor offset . 7172

Call Center AI : A large telecommunications company (anonymous example from industry reports)
implemented an AI chatbot on its website and interactive voice response on its phone line that could
handle basic troubleshooting (resetting modems, checking account info). They found it resolved
about 30% of customer queries without a human. This allowed them to halt hiring despite growth in
customer base, effectively doing more with the same number of agents. Some companies even
reportedly closed certain call centers after implementing AI, reassigning a few staff to escalations
and cutting the rest. A public example is Lyft  (the rideshare company) which in 2023 announced it
was  heavily  investing  in  automation  for  customer  support,  aiming  to  automate  up  to  100%  of
support interactions that don’t require “high-level” intervention.
Accounting automation : A mid-sized accounting firm deployed an AI-powered bookkeeping system
that automatically categorizes expenses, matches receipts, and flags anomalies for human review.
As a result, they could serve the same number of clients with 30% fewer junior accountants. The
freed capacity was used to take on more advisory work, but notably they did not replace several who
left – a direct labor saving.
Human  resources  (HR)  automation :  HR  departments  use  software  to  handle  many  tasks  like
screening resumes (AI tools rank candidates), onboarding paperwork (e-signature platforms auto-fill
details), even answering employee questions via HR chatbots (like “How do I change my healthcare
plan?”). This means a large company might not need as many HR staff per employee as before. One
study by Oracle found a significant percentage of employees get their HR questions answered by
digital assistants now.
All these incremental automations contribute to a scenario where the “fully loaded” corporate office of
the  past  –  with  large  teams  of  assistants,  clerks,  support  staff  –  is  slimming  down .  High-level
professionals  remain,  but  their  support  system  is  often  partly  digital.  For  example,  where  a  team  of
executives in the 1990s might each have had a secretary and a pool of typists, today they might all just use
Microsoft Office and have one shared admin or none at all, relying on their own computers and automation.
Limitations and Customer Considerations
Service automation does face some pushback and challenges. Unlike a hidden factory robot, customer-
facing automation is very visible to the public and can influence customer satisfaction. Not everyone likes
dealing with machines instead of people. Businesses must balance cost savings with customer experience.
For instance,  some restaurants found that while kiosks save labor, they still keep some cashiers
especially for tech-averse customers or to provide a human touch that can increase upselling or
satisfaction . Similarly, hotels realized that while mobile check-in is great for frequent travelers, others value
a friendly face at reception – so many hotels move to a hybrid model, not zero staff.
Quality of AI in services is another limitation: chatbots can frustrate customers if they don’t understand the
query. Many companies have had to ensure a quick “escape to human” option to avoid losing customers.
The maturity of AI will determine how far companies can go in automating front-line service without
harming their business through poor service. 
In fields like healthcare or legal advice (part of services too), people generally demand human professionals,
and automation mostly plays a support role (we’ll cover healthcare separately due to its importance). • 
• 
• 
21
Economically , however , businesses will implement automation in services up to the point that the marginal
cost of lost customers or lower satisfaction equals the marginal savings. If customers largely accept or even
prefer automated options (as is often the case for simple tasks), then companies will push those heavily.
Already, many younger customers prefer self-service or digital interfaces over waiting for a human. This
generational shift bodes well for further service automation – the future customer might rarely need to talk
to an employee for routine needs, meaning companies can truly operate with minimal staff focusing only
on complex, high-value interactions.
The Next 5–10 Years in Services
Expect  the  line  between  human  and  machine  service  to  blur  further .  Generative  AI ,  like  GPT-4  and
successors, can potentially handle more sophisticated conversations and content creation. We might see AI
“agents” taking on roles like copywriting, basic marketing emails, drafting legal contracts from templates,
writing computer code from specs, etc., which could reduce the number of entry-level workers in those
areas . A law firm might not hire as many junior associates if an AI can do first drafts of contracts. A
marketing firm might streamline with AI producing social media content that a manager just edits.
In hospitality and food service, robots are likely to get cheaper and more reliable. Flippy the burger robot is
now in its second or third generation and being deployed in more restaurants (White Castle expanded its
pilot after initial success). McDonald’s in 2022 opened a concept restaurant near Fort Worth, Texas, that
is heavily automated  – it has conveyor belts delivering food to drive-thru customers, automated beverage
systems, and ordering is all digital; it’s not completely human-free, but it operates with a much smaller crew
focused only on cooking and some assembly in the back. If that model works, it could roll out to more
locations especially in high-wage areas.
Cleaning robots  (autonomous vacuums, scrubbers) are already used in big stores and airports, replacing
nighttime cleaning crews. In the future, small hospitality venues might use cleaning robots to do overnight
cleanup of dining areas or hotel corridors, reducing janitorial staff.
However , complete elimination of employees in many service contexts might lag other sectors due to the
human preference factor . Many service businesses will likely keep some personnel for the personal touch
or  oversight.  The  hypothesis  of  “optimal  employees  =  0”  has  to  be  tempered  by  “optimal  customer
experience = ?”. But from a purely operational cost standpoint, businesses will minimize staff as far as they
can without hurting revenue.
The  McKinsey automation potential analysis  highlights that  services like accommodation/food have
the highest potential (73%)  because of many predictable physical tasks (cooking, cleaning, serving) –
suggesting that if technology is adopted, those jobs could largely be automated with current tech. We’re
already seeing the beginnings of robotic cooks and cleaners as discussed. The lowest potential tasks  are
managing  people,  applying  expertise,  and  social-emotional  interaction ,  which  is  why  sectors  like
education, healthcare, and parts of professional services  remain more human. But even those will have
their routine components carved out by automation. 
Thus, for many service businesses, the equilibrium staffing  in a decade could be significantly lower . Fast
food  outlets  might  go  from  10-15  staff  per  location  to  maybe  2-3  (some  kitchen  managers  and  a
troubleshooter) plus remote support. A mid-tier hotel might reduce staff by 30-50% by relying on kiosks,65
80
22
mobile apps, and robotics for deliveries and cleaning. Large corporations might have smaller support
departments due to software automation, focusing hires on creative and strategic roles.
Services show that even work that once seemed inherently human-facing is being subdivided: the repetitive
parts to machines, the complex parts to humans. That naturally means fewer humans overall are needed
to deliver the service . The next sections will address retail (which overlaps with services) , followed by
knowledge industries like software (where the product is automation itself) , finance , agriculture , and
healthcare  – each with their own nuances in the automation journey.
Software and Technology Industry: Extreme Scalability with
Minimal Labor
It’s  often  noted  that  software  is  eating  the  world ,  but  in  doing  so,  software  companies  themselves
exemplify how a business can achieve enormous scale with very few employees. The software and tech
industry is unique in that its primary outputs (applications, digital services) can be replicated and delivered
electronically at near-zero marginal cost. This has enabled some software firms to reach millions or even
billions of users with tiny teams , a feat impossible in traditional industries. Thus, if any sector embodies
the “optimal number of employees is zero (or close to zero)” concept, it’s software – where automation isn’t
just a tool, it’s the product, and it can replace human effort both inside and outside the company.
Scaling to Millions of Users with Dozens of Employees
A  striking  case  study  is  the  earlier  mentioned  WhatsApp .  In  2014,  when  WhatsApp  was  acquired  by
Facebook  for  $19  billion,  it  had  just  55  employees  serving  420  million  users  worldwide .  Each
employee, through the leverage of software, effectively “handled” communications for over 7.5 million users
–  a  ratio  unheard  of  in  physical  industries.  WhatsApp  achieved  this  by  creating  a  highly  automated
messaging platform that required minimal manual intervention. The servers ran the service, and everyday
operations (routing messages, account management, etc.) were automated. It monetized very little (no ads,
just a nominal $1 fee in some cases) yet was incredibly efficient. Post-acquisition, even as WhatsApp grew to
1+ billion users, its core team remained very small (the founders famously emphasized simplicity and lean
staffing). 
Another iconic example:  Instagram . When Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion, Instagram
had only 13 employees  managing a platform of about 30 million users and rapidly growing . A mere 13
people to delight tens of millions with a photo-sharing service – again, possible because the app itself and
the cloud infrastructure did the heavy lifting. Instagram’s acquisition showed that in the digital realm, a
startup can create enormous value with practically no staff relative to user base. A quip from that time was
that Instagram was valued at ~$77 million per employee , highlighting the leverage each employee had
through technology.
We see similar patterns with other tech products:  YouTube  was running with a few hundred employees
when Google bought it, but serving millions of video views.  Skype  had on the order of a few hundred
employees  for  hundreds  of  millions  of  users  when  acquired  by  Microsoft.  Even  Google  and  Facebook
themselves, though they have tens of thousands of employees now, have user-to-employee ratios far
beyond any non-tech company of similar market cap. For instance, Facebook (Meta) serves nearly 3 billion7
8
81
23
users with roughly 60,000 employees; compare that to, say, AT&T which has 100 million customers but also
about 160,000 employees (telecom is more physical infra heavy, but it illustrates the contrast).
The reason software companies can be so lean is that  software automation underpins their entire
operation . Once the code is written and the servers are set up (which themselves are largely automated
nowadays), adding more users doesn’t require hiring more people linearly. The code handles it. Customer
onboarding, service delivery, even maintenance can often be automated or handled by very few engineers
monitoring systems. This results in near-zero marginal labor cost . If you double the number of users, you
might not need any new employees, just more servers (which can be managed by the same ops team using
scripts and cloud platforms).
DevOps and Infrastructure Automation
Within software companies, there has been a push to automate internal processes as much as possible – a
philosophy of DevOps and site reliability engineering (SRE)  ensures that running large services doesn’t
require large operations teams. Automation tools handle code deployment, scaling, monitoring, and failure
recovery. For example, automated build and deployment pipelines  mean that code written by developers
can be integrated, tested, and deployed to production with minimal human oversight. A small DevOps team
can keep thousands of servers running through software that detects issues and heals them (e.g., replaces
a failed instance, balances load). Google famously pioneered SRE where one rule of thumb was that one SRE
engineer could oversee hundreds of thousands of machines because of robust automation.
This meta-automation (using software to automate software operations) drastically cuts down the number
of system administrators or support engineers needed. In the early 2000s, a common ratio might have
been 1 sysadmin per 20–30 servers. Now, cloud computing and automation have blown that away: one
engineer can manage thousands of cloud instances by writing scripts or using cloud provider tools. This
enables companies like WhatsApp to run with tiny ops teams – WhatsApp, in its early days, leaned on highly
efficient tech like Erlang and a well-automated system, reportedly having only 5 operations engineers to
manage its back-end for hundreds of millions of users.
Product and Support Automation
Software companies also automate a lot of their  customer support and sales  via digital means. Many
adopt a self-service model – users sign up online, use the product, and find help in knowledge bases or
forums. Minimal human involvement is needed compared to traditional businesses that have salespeople
or large support call centers. For instance, when a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) product goes to market, it
might rely on automated onboarding emails, in-app tutorials, and maybe an AI chatbot for support, rather
than a big support team. Only escalations go to a small human team.
Open-source and developer ecosystems  further amplify how little direct labor a company might need:
open-source contributions can improve a product without the company paying those contributors, and
developer-users often support each other in communities.
AI Creating Software and Content
The software industry is now starting to use  AI to create software , which is automation turned inward.
Advanced  machine  learning  models  can  generate  code  from  descriptions  (GitHub’s  Copilot,  based  on
24
OpenAI Codex, is one such tool). While not ready to replace programmers wholesale, these tools can boost
productivity. Some startups claim they’ve reduced the need to hire extra developers because AI helps their
existing ones code faster . If this improves, a future software startup might need even fewer coders to
achieve a given feature set. 
Similarly,  tech  companies  that  deal  in  content  (social  media,  media  platforms)  use  AI  for  content
moderation , a task that would otherwise require armies of human moderators. Facebook, YouTube, etc.,
have invested in AI that automatically removes or flags policy-violating content. They still employ many
moderators for the hard cases, but the heavy lifting (like removing millions of obvious spam or nudity posts)
is done by algorithms, saving countless man-hours. 
Capital vs Labor in Tech
From a business view, software firms often see  labor as a fixed cost  to develop the product, and then
scaling mostly involves capital (servers, bandwidth). Given that the cost of cloud infrastructure per user can
be very low (pennies per user for many apps), they achieve high gross margins with few employees. When
they do hire, it’s often for creating new features (thus temporarily raising costs) or for direct sales efforts in
enterprise software (somewhat less automated segment). But even enterprise software is shifting to low-
touch sales (free trials, product-led growth) which reduces the need for large salesforces.
Software also tends to automate other industries . A small software company can disrupt a larger labor-
intensive industry by providing an automated solution. For example, Uber (though not small in employees
now) used software to mobilize freelance drivers, avoiding the overhead of managing drivers directly as
employees like a taxi company would. The trend of platform businesses  is relevant: they often generate
huge revenue with few employees by automating the matching of supply and demand (Airbnb, Uber , etc.,
have far fewer staff than the industries they compete with like hotels or taxi companies, because much of
the work is done by the platform or by external participants).
The Extreme: One-Person Companies
We’re seeing a rise in very small companies (even one-person) that thanks to software automation can do
what used to require teams. A single developer can deploy an app to millions using cloud services (which
handle  scaling),  use  payment  APIs  to  monetize  (no  need  for  a  billing  department),  and  use  online
marketplaces for distribution (no sales team needed).  No-code tools  enable non-programmers to create
apps or workflows, reducing the need for specialized staff.
There are anecdotes of “micro-SaaS” products earning substantial revenue with just one person behind
them who automates everything from marketing (via scheduled social media posts and SEO) to customer
service (canned responses, chatbots). While not all will succeed, the mere possibility shows how far one can
go with near-zero labor by leveraging existing automation building blocks.
Future Outlook
The  software  industry  will  likely  continue  to  push  the  envelope  of  minimal  necessary  employees.  If
anything, some large tech companies have bloated a bit with big staffs, but recent trends show they are
willing to trim workforce when growth slows, and often the underlying services don’t suffer because of how
much is automated. For example, in 2023 many big tech firms laid off sizable portions of staff (often in non-
25
engineering roles or experimental projects) without impacting their core product operations, hinting that
the core runs quite lean.
AI  developments  could  further  reduce  labor  needs  in  code  development,  quality  assurance  (AI  can
generate and run tests), customer support (AI support gets better), and even design (AI generating UI
layouts or graphic assets). That means a future startup could potentially be even more of a one-man show,
or a small team of product visionaries with AI doing a lot of grunt work.
However , one must note that tech companies do hire a lot for developing new products – the limiting factor
isn’t just running the service, but innovating. But the question is optimal employees for operations  tends to
zero; for innovation  there’s still a benefit to human talent, though even there some tasks are assisted by AI.
In conclusion, the software industry already demonstrates that  a company can operate at huge scale
with minimal human labor  – sometimes measured in single or double digits of staff. It achieves this by
turning every aspect of its business into code and algorithms, from the product to the support to the
distribution.  If  other  industries  adopt  even  a  fraction  of  this  approach  (digitizing  and  automating
processes), they too can slash the required workforce. The software sector’s motto could well be “let code
do the work” – and it highlights that when feasible, that is the most cost-efficient path. The “optimal”
employees for software delivery can be very close to zero for many tasks (and indeed, serverless computing
even abstracts away operations such that there aren’t even sysadmins managing servers – it’s all handled by
the cloud provider’s automation).
From software, let’s move to  finance , where automation has reshaped things like trading and banking,
continuing the theme of doing more with fewer people.
Finance and Banking: Algorithms and the Leaner Financial Firm
The finance industry, encompassing banking, investment, and insurance, has long been information-centric
and  thus  ripe  for  computerization.  Over  the  past  few  decades,  many  functions  in  finance  have  been
transformed by automation – from algorithmic trading on Wall Street to ATM networks in retail banking.
Financial firms pursue automation to reduce labor costs, increase transaction speed, and gain competitive
advantages in accuracy and data handling. As a result, the archetype of bustling trading floors filled with
hundreds of people or bank branches with rows of tellers is giving way to servers humming in data centers
and customers transacting via apps . The equilibrium number of employees in many financial institutions has
been dropping, particularly in roles like trading, operations, and customer service.
Algorithmic Trading and Investment
Perhaps the most striking change has been in the realm of  trading and asset management . In the
1980s-90s, large investment banks and hedge funds employed swarms of traders to buy and sell securities.
Today,  a  huge  proportion  of  trading  is  done  by  algorithms  –  computer  programs  executing  trades
automatically  based  on  market  conditions  and  quantitative  strategies.  These  algorithms  can  react  in
microseconds, far faster than any human. Consequently, trading floors that once housed hundreds of
people are now much quieter .
26
A  concrete  example:  Goldman  Sachs’  U.S.  equities  trading  desk .  Around  the  year  2000,  Goldman
employed roughly 600 traders in New York making markets in stocks . By 2017, 600 human traders had
been  whittled  down  to  just  2  equity  traders ,  supported  by  automated  trading  programs  and  about  200
computer engineers maintaining the algorithms . Goldman’s CFO highlighted that “four traders can
be replaced by one computer engineer”  on average in their experience , and indeed the firm had
about one-third of its entire staff consisting of engineers at that point . This is a dramatic labor shift:
where once dozens of highly paid traders were needed, now a handful of coders and a skeleton crew of
traders suffice, thanks to automation. The algorithms (and electronic market platforms) handle the routine
trading flows and market-making that humans used to shout about on exchange floors or phone lines.
Similarly, in hedge funds and asset management , systematic funds use algorithms to manage portfolios
with  minimal  human  intervention.  The  rise  of  index  funds  and  ETFs  –  which  are  often  managed  by
formulaic rebalancing – means fewer active stock pickers relative to assets under management. Some
investment firms like Renaissance Technologies (a quant hedge fund) have staggering ratios of assets to
employees because their models do the heavy lifting.
There are also fully automated trading firms – high-frequency trading (HFT)  shops – where the number of
employees is small (maybe a few dozen) but they trade volumes that would have required armies of floor
traders in the past. For instance, Virtu Financial, an HFT firm, once famously had only 148 employees and
yet on many days was responsible for 5% or more of U.S. stock trading volume , essentially letting
algorithms  do  the  work  of  thousands  of  traders .  Their  revenue  per  employee  was  astronomical
compared to traditional brokerages, illustrating how automation concentrates output in fewer hands.
The  cost advantages  are clear: automated trading systems execute huge numbers of transactions at a
fraction of the cost of a human-centric operation (no need to pay commissions or salaries to traders for
each trade, algorithms scale across markets 24/7). Additionally, they can be more precise and capture
opportunities that humans might miss (or in the case of HFT, exploit sub-second price discrepancies).
Retail Banking Automation
On the consumer banking side, as noted earlier , technologies like ATMs, online banking, and mobile apps
have automated many routine banking services. This has led to fewer bank branches and tellers over time.
For example, a combination of ATM ubiquity and digital banking  allowed banks to consolidate operations
– the  number of bank branches in the U.S. declined by about 12% from 2009 to 2020 , and that
decline accelerated in recent years (over 2000 branches closed in 2023 alone) . Each branch closure and
migration to digital channels effectively eliminates several teller and branch service jobs. 
Customers now commonly use mobile apps to deposit checks (check imaging) , transfer funds, pay bills,
etc., which used to require a banker’s time. Banks encourage this because the cost per digital transaction is
cents, whereas a teller transaction costs dollars. Some banks have even introduced fully automated or very-
light staffed branches – e.g., small kiosks with ATMs and video conferencing to a remote banker if needed.
Loan processing  is another area of automation. Online lenders and banks use automated underwriting
algorithms to approve consumer loans in seconds, a process that might have taken days of paperwork and
review by loan officers in the past. This reduces the number of loan officers needed for high-volume, simple
loans. For mortgages and complex loans, humans still often make final decisions, but even there, a lot of
the data gathering and preliminary decisions are automated (credit scoring algorithms, risk models).82

27
Insurance  has embraced automation in claims processing and underwriting as well. Some insurers use AI
to analyze photos of car damage for claims, eliminating some adjuster visits. Policy management and
customer inquiries are often handled with digital portals and chatbots, trimming call center needs.
One can see a pattern:  self-service and digital platforms  take over many customer-facing tasks, while
algorithms and RPA  take over many back-office tasks. The combination means a financial institution can
handle more customers or more assets without a proportional increase in staff.
Case Study: A Digital Bank vs. Traditional Bank
Consider a new fintech digital bank that operates primarily via an app – say  Chime or Revolut . These
companies boast millions of customers but have only a few hundred to a couple thousand employees. They
have no branch network (huge saving on personnel and real estate) and rely on automation for account
opening (online verification), customer onboarding, fraud monitoring, and even compliance (AI transaction
monitoring for AML, etc.). In contrast, a traditional bank with the same number of customers might have
tens of thousands of employees. The digital bank’s cost per customer is much lower , giving it room to offer
lower fees or attractive rates. 
Another example is the app-based trading platforms  (Robinhood, etc.) which gained huge user bases with
relatively small teams by automating all the trading infrastructure and customer support primarily through
app  interfaces  (though  Robinhood  had  to  scale  customer  support  after  some  incidents,  it’s  still  lean
compared to legacy brokerages).
Cost-Benefit in Finance
The  reasons  financial  firms  invest  in  automation  align  with  prior  themes:  cost  reduction,  speed,  and
capacity. But also risk reduction – automated systems can enforce compliance rules more consistently than
humans (reducing costly errors). They also reduce operational risk  from manual mistakes (like a fat-finger
trade  by  a  human  that  could  cost  millions;  algorithms  are  less  likely  to  deviate  from  programmed
constraints, though they introduce their own risks if misprogrammed).
From a labor perspective, the optimal staffing  for , say, a trading operation that’s fully algorithmic might
literally be zero traders , just some tech and oversight staff. Many modern trading desks approach that ideal.
A notable story was that some bank trading floors have been so depopulated that they converted the space
to other uses – a far cry from 30 years ago when adding more phones and people was the norm.
Financial Advisors and Automated Advice
Even the realm of personalized financial advice is seeing automation through “robo-advisors.”  These are
algorithmic investment advisory services (like Betterment, Wealthfront, or those offered by Schwab and
Vanguard) that allocate and rebalance your portfolio automatically based on your goals. They charge low
fees and handle many clients per algorithm. A single engineer can maintain an advisory algorithm that
serves tens of thousands of clients, whereas traditionally each human financial advisor could only handle a
few hundred clients at most. While many investors still value human advice for complex planning, the
growth of robo-advisors (with billions under management and minimal staff) shows the potential to scale
advice with software, reducing need for large advisory staff for basic investing.

Future Trends in Finance
Looking ahead, we can expect continued automation  in finance in areas like: 
Advanced AI in trading and portfolio management:  AI might further optimize trading strategies
or even dynamically adjust investment portfolios in ways humans can’t keep up with. This could
reduce analysts and active fund managers in favor of AI-run funds (though it may create some new
quants and AI specialists roles). The net likely still fewer people needed per $ of assets.
Blockchain  and  smart  contracts:  If  financial  transactions  move  to  decentralized  automated
systems (DeFi, etc.), that could automate trust and middle-office processes. For example, settlement
and clearing – currently requiring teams at exchanges and banks – could be handled by blockchain
automatically, trimming those operational teams.
Retail  banking  fully  digital:  The  number  of  branches  will  likely  continue  to  shrink  as  older
customers age out and younger generations rarely if ever visit a bank in person. Banks may try to
automate more complex services via video kiosks or AI (like AI that can answer complex questions
about mortgage options). Perhaps in 5–10 years, walking into a physical bank will be a rarity; most
routine banking and even lending may happen through apps and AI-driven interfaces. This implies
far fewer branch staff and perhaps fewer centralized call center staff if AI can handle more queries.
Insurance  automation:  Underwriting  will  increasingly  use  AI  models  (e.g.,  analyzing  driving
behavior data for car insurance) which could reduce underwriter jobs for standard policies. Claims
might be processed via automation (e.g., IoT devices in home detecting an issue and triggering a
claim payout through a smart contract without human adjusters, for some cases).
One report from analysts speculated that by 2030, the number of employees in the U.S. banking sector
could decline by hundreds of thousands  due to efficiency gains from AI and automation, particularly in
back-office and branch roles. Already, banks like JPMorgan have deployed AI to review legal documents
(something that used to require lawyers and loan officers) – e.g., one tool reportedly reviewed commercial
loan agreements in seconds that took lawyers 360,000 hours cumulatively a year . This freed those
lawyers for other tasks or enabled reducing external legal costs. 
One caveat  is that finance is heavily regulated, and sometimes regulation can slow down or require human
oversight even if automation is possible. Also, certain high-touch services (private banking for ultra-wealthy,
complex corporate dealmaking) will still rely on human relationships. But these are high value-add roles; the
bulk of transactional or routine work is on the path to automation.
In summary, the finance industry demonstrates how algorithms can do both high-volume routine work
(like retail transactions)  and high-stakes analytical work (like trading) , each time reducing the need for
human labor in those areas. The optimal staffing for many financial operations is now a mix of a few
experts and many machines – and in some cases, just machines with remote oversight. The industry’s shift
supports the hypothesis that as technology improves, a profitable firm in finance will employ as few people
as necessary , leaning on capital (IT systems, AI) to do the rest. Many banks and funds are explicitly aiming
for that kind of model to remain competitive.•

Next, we will address the retail industry , which overlaps partially with what we’ve covered (service kiosks,
etc.) but has its own dynamics in terms of automation’s impact on employees (especially in physical retail vs.
e-commerce).
Retail: Self-Checkout, E-Commerce, and the Automated Storefront
The retail industry – selling goods to consumers – is a major employer worldwide, with roles from cashiers
and store clerks to stockers and warehouse personnel. Automation in retail has been two-pronged: in-store
automation  to reduce staff (e.g., self-checkout kiosks, inventory robots) and the rise of e-commerce  which
shifts retail to a more automated warehouse-centric model (covered under logistics) that often requires less
labor per dollar of sales than traditional stores. Retailers are adopting technology to cut costs and adapt to
changing consumer preferences for speed and convenience. The guiding principle for many innovations is
to  enable  customers  to  serve  themselves  or  to  streamline  operations  so  that  fewer  employees  are
needed to run a store or fulfill orders.
Self-Checkout and Store Automation
One of the most visible retail automations is self-checkout systems . These kiosks allow customers to scan
and pay for their items without a cashier . They’ve proliferated in supermarkets, big-box stores, and even
small shops. Each self-checkout machine can replace one cashier station; a single attendant can oversee 4–6
self-checkout  units,  intervening  only  if  there’s  an  issue.  This  significantly  reduces  cashier  labor  hours
needed. For example, a grocery store that might have had 10 cashier lanes staffed at peak could install 10
self-checkouts and only 2 staff assisting, cutting cashier staff by 80%. 
The motivation is clear: cashiers are one of the largest categories of employment in many countries and
often a significant cost for retailers. By using self-checkouts, retailers save on wages. Customers often
appreciate  shorter  lines,  and  younger  shoppers  comfortable  with  tech  may  prefer  it.  Of  course,  self-
checkouts  come  with  issues  (theft,  need  for  occasional  assistance,  some  customer  frustration),  but
improvements (better weight sensors, AI cameras to detect mis-scans, etc.) are addressing some of these.
Beyond checkout, stores are trying other automated or semi-automated roles:
Inventory management:  Some stores employ robots that roam aisles to check stock and prices .
For instance, Walmart trialed shelf-scanning robots (Bossa Nova Robotics) that went down aisles and
used  cameras  to  identify  out-of-stock  items  or  wrong  pricing.  The  idea  was  to  automate  the
laborious task of inventory checking and free employees from that. Walmart did end one contract
after  finding  alternate  methods  (and  possibly  due  to  concerns  of  robots  bothering  customers),
noting that humans could handle it as well during online order picking . But other retailers,
like  Schnucks  grocery  chain,  have  kept  using  such  robots  (nicknamed  “Tally”)  effectively.  Even
without robots, some are using smart cameras on shelves  to detect product levels. Fewer workers
need to manually audit stock – they only come to replenish when flagged.
In-store robotics and automation:  Some larger stores have experimented with automated guided
vehicles  for  internal  transport  (moving  products  from  storage  to  shelves).  Grocery  stores  have
tested machines like automated deli slicers or baking machines  that require less staff operation.
Cleaning robots  (floor scrubbers that autonomously clean stores after hours) are being used by
Walmart and others, cutting down janitorial staff needs.•

Customer service robots or kiosks:  Information kiosks (touchscreens where customers can look up
product  locations  or  check  prices)  reduce  the  need  for  floor  staff  to  answer  questions.  Lowes
experimented with a robot assistant (“LoweBot”) that could guide customers to items, though such
concepts haven’t become mainstream yet.
The most radical approach to in-store automation is the  “just walk out” store concept , pioneered by
Amazon Go . These convenience stores have no checkout at all  – customers scan their app on entry, pick
up items, and simply walk out. A combination of cameras, shelf sensors, and AI tracks what they took and
charges their Amazon account automatically. The store thus has no need for cashiers . Amazon Go stores do
employ a few people to handle things like restocking and assisting or prepping fresh food, but the front-of-
store staff (cashiers) are zero. Other companies are following suit: in China, a flurry of “unmanned store”
startups emerged around 2017 using RFID or computer vision to allow a similar concept. Major retailers like
Tesco and Walmart have done pilots of cashierless stores as well. Amazon itself is expanding this tech to
larger supermarkets (Amazon Fresh stores in some locations use a version of it). 
If the “grab-and-go” model proves scalable, it could eliminate cashier roles entirely in many formats. There
are challenges – it requires sophisticated tech and can be costly to implement, plus some shoppers aren’t
comfortable or might try to foil the system – but it’s likely to improve and spread, especially as sensor costs
drop and AI gets better at tracking multiple people and items.
E-Commerce Shift and Labor Distribution
The rise of e-commerce  (online shopping) has arguably automated retail in a different way: by moving the
point of sale from a human-staffed store to a website and an automated fulfillment center . When you buy
online, no human “rings up” your sale; you browse and checkout through software. This fundamentally
reduces the number of sales associates and cashiers needed per transaction in the economy. Instead, you
have warehouse and delivery workers – but as we discussed, warehouses are increasingly automated, and
delivery may someday be as well. 
E-commerce is more  labor efficient per dollar of sales  in many cases. A study might find that a brick-and-
mortar retailer requires e.g. 3–4 employees per $1 million of sales (for stocking, sales, checkout, etc.),
whereas an e-commerce operation might only need 1–2 per $1 million of sales (mainly in fulfillment and
customer service), thanks to automation in ordering and processing. Over the last decade, as e-commerce
took double-digit share of retail, it led to some decline in physical retail jobs or at least slower growth
compared to sales growth.
Retailers like  Walmart  have huge initiatives to automate. Walmart, beyond testing shelf robots, also has
automated warehouses  for fulfilling online grocery orders (using systems by Ocado or others) which
reduce  the  labor  for  picking  items.  They  also  introduced  pickup  towers  (giant  vending-machine-like
structures in stores where customers can retrieve online orders without an associate’s help – effectively
automating the customer pickup process).
Another trend is smart vending and micro-fulfillment  – turning retail into essentially automated vending
machines  for  certain  products.  For  example,  you  might  have  automated  prescription  pickup  kiosks  at
pharmacies (thus fewer pharmacists handing out meds for refills), or automated locker pickup for packages
(no clerk needed).• 
31
Labor Impact and Cost Savings
The  cost  savings  from  these  retail  automations  come  from  both  reducing  payroll  and  increasing
throughput. Self-checkout not only cuts cashier hours, it can also speed up lines, arguably letting a store
handle more customers in peak times with the same floor space (if 6 people can check out at once via kiosks
vs 3 with human cashiers, that’s higher throughput). The  Amazon Go model  aims to eliminate checkout
lines entirely, making convenience shopping faster – which could attract more business.
For big-box retailers working on thin margins (~2-5%), trimming labor costs is crucial. Walmart, for instance,
spends tens of billions on wages annually – even a few percent saved via automation can mean huge
dollars. Walmart’s decision to pull back on shelf robots  was interesting; it suggests either the cost/
benefit wasn’t favorable or they found alternative ways (like leveraging employees already in aisles for
online order picking to also check inventory) . But Walmart also said it would continue testing other tech
and using apps for inventory with workers , so the drive to optimize remains.
Stock replenishment  is still labor-intensive – someone has to put items on shelves – but even there, some
innovation exists (e.g., robots that can bring shelves out or use mechanical systems to push products
forward as they sell, etc.). 
Where retail really cuts labor is by merging with e-commerce. Think of showroom stores  where customers
browse samples but orders are shipped from a warehouse. Those showrooms can have very few staff since
they’re not handling checkout or inventory on site.
In the next 5–10 years: 
We may see entirely cashierless supermarkets  if Amazon’s larger-format trials succeed. Amazon
has already opened a 25,000 sq ft grocery store in Seattle using the “Just Walk Out” tech. If rolled out
widely,  a  typical  supermarket  which  might  employ  20-30  cashiers  (plus  some  percentage  of
management for them) could drop that number to near zero, keeping maybe a couple staff for
oversight or special cases. Cashier is one of the most common jobs in the world, so this would be a
significant shift.
More “dark stores”  (stores closed to customers, functioning only as fulfillment centers for online
orders). These can be partially or fully automated, requiring only a handful of workers to handle
exceptions and maintenance. Dark stores essentially cut the customer-facing labor entirely.
Personalization  AI  on  retail  websites  might  reduce  customer  service  chats/calls  for
recommendations. Like a digital store clerk that helps you find what you need, replacing some sales
associate functions.
The net effect might be that while the absolute number  of retail jobs may not crater (due to overall growth
and slow adoption in some segments), the jobs per dollar of retail sales  will likely decline. Traditional retailers
will operate with leaner staffs, and new retail formats (like unattended stores, automated kiosks, etc.) will
emerge that intentionally have almost no employees on site.
One  must  also  consider  counterexamples :  Some  retailers  have  found  too  much  automation  hurts
experience. For example, some grocery stores initially went heavy on self-checkouts but had to keep some89

manned  lanes  due  to  customer  preference  (especially  among  elderly  or  for  large  orders).  Also,  theft
(“shrink”)  can  rise  with  self-checkout  if  not  carefully  managed,  potentially  eating  into  savings.  And  as
mentioned, Walmart paused the shelf robot rollout partially because employees picking online orders gave
them inventory visibility anyway during the pandemic surge , plus possible perception issues of robots in
stores .
Labor redeployment  can occur: retailers might move some cashiers into more customer service or sales
roles, which arguably could improve sales. But many will likely reduce net headcount or repurpose roles to
focus on things automation can’t do (yet), like high-touch customer engagement or keeping fresh food
prepared.
In sum, retail is on a path to have fewer employees per store and per transaction , thanks to self-service
and digital shopping. The optimal store of the future might have just a manager and a couple of stockers,
with everything else – checkout, info, even security (via cameras) – handled by tech. Already, some smaller
footprint stores (like electronics kiosks or automated convenience boxes) exist that have zero on-site staff –
basically giant vending machines with a broad selection. As technology and consumer comfort progress, we
could see more of those, especially in controlled environments like malls, airports, or campuses.
Now, after covering a range of sectors largely positively impacted by automation, we turn to agriculture
and healthcare , two sectors often highlighted as either historical examples (agriculture) or more resistant
(healthcare) to full automation.
Agriculture: From Mechanization to Autonomous Farming
Agriculture was one of the first sectors to undergo a dramatic labor transformation through technology – as
noted earlier , mechanization in the 20th century led to a massive drop in farm employment from ~40% of
the workforce in 1900 to <2% by 2000 in the U.S. . That initial wave (tractors, combines, automated
irrigation) can be seen as the first automation revolution in farming. Today, agriculture is poised for a new
wave of automation with precision farming, robotics, and AI-driven equipment  that could further reduce
the need for human labor in certain tasks, possibly steering toward the concept of “smart farms” that run
with minimal hands.
Mechanization and Its Legacy
The introduction of machines like tractors for plowing, planting, and harvesting fundamentally altered farm
economics. One tractor could do the work of many farmhands or draft animals. For example, the adoption
of the mechanical combine harvester allows one driver to harvest grain at a rate that would have taken
dozens of workers with scythes. Likewise, cotton harvesting, which once relied on huge numbers of manual
pickers, is now done by machines. These advances already realized the hypothesis in significant measure:
the “optimal” field labor for tasks like plowing or harvesting became effectively zero – a single farmer with a
machine or later even a self-guided machine could suffice.
By  boosting  each  farmer’s  productivity  enormously  (e.g.,  one  farmer  today  feeds  over  100  people  on
average, vs. one farmer feeding themselves and a few others in the pre-mechanization era), machines
displaced millions of agricultural jobs. Society absorbed that by shifting labor to other industries. But if we
focus on agriculture itself, it’s a near-complete example of technology drastically reducing workforce needs
while increasing output.89

Current Automation Technologies in Farming
Now the focus is on precision and autonomous agriculture . Key developments:
Autonomous Tractors and Field Equipment:  Major manufacturers like John Deere, Case IH, etc.,
are developing or selling tractors that can operate autonomously. In 2022, John Deere unveiled a
fully autonomous tractor system for tillage – the tractor has cameras and AI to navigate fields
without a driver . These tractors can be monitored via smartphone. By 2030, John Deere aims to
have a fleet of autonomous machinery covering multiple farm operations . If this takes off, tasks
like plowing, planting, or spraying could be done with no one in the cab. A farmer might supervise
multiple machines remotely or simply set them and let them run. That could reduce seasonal labor
needs drastically. For example, currently a large farm might hire extra tractor operators during
planting/harvest; with autonomy, the farmer and a technician could handle it all.
Robotic Harvesters:  Certain high-value crops like fruits and vegetables traditionally require hand-
picking due to their delicate nature and unstructured environments. Now, robotics companies are
tackling this: e.g., robotic strawberry pickers (using computer vision to identify ripe berries and
robotic grippers to gently pick them), apple-picking robots that vacuum or pluck apples from trees,
and lettuce/thinning robots. One company developed a lettuce thinning robot that uses AI to identify
which sprouts to remove to space out plants, a job once done by crews with hoes. There are also
prototypes of robots that can pick grapes, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. These machines are slower
than  humans  so  far ,  but  they  can  work  continuously  and  don’t  demand  wages,  making  them
economically attractive over time – especially as farm labor gets scarcer and more expensive in many
countries.
Drones and Aerial Imaging:  Drones equipped with cameras or sensors now survey fields to detect
issues like pest infestations, nutrient deficiencies, or irrigation needs. This automates crop scouting,
which used to be done by walking fields. Fewer agronomists need to physically inspect – a single
drone  operator  (or  fully  automated  drone  flights)  can  cover  huge  acreage  quickly,  with  AI
interpreting the imagery to tell the farmer what needs attention. This indirectly reduces labor by
optimizing where humans need to intervene.
Precision application (robots for weeding/spraying):  Robots like those by Naïo Technologies or
Blue River (acquired by John Deere) can navigate fields to precisely identify weeds and zap or spray
them individually, reducing the need for manual weeding or blanket spraying. Blue River’s “See &
Spray” system uses AI to detect weeds and only spray herbicide on them, which not only saves
chemicals but also automates what could be manual spot-weeding tasks in some crops. Fewer field
workers needed for weed control.
Milking Robots and Livestock Automation:  In dairy farming, robotic milking systems  (like Lely’s
Astronaut) allow cows to walk into a station and be milked automatically by a machine that cleans
and attaches to the cow. Many dairy farms in Europe and North America use these; one robot can
service around 50-70 cows, operating throughout the day, meaning a farm can reduce labor (no
need for twice-daily manual milking by farmhands). Automatic feeders, barn cleaning robots, and
even cow-monitoring sensors (to detect health or estrus) further cut down the manual oversight
needed  in  animal  husbandry.  Some  large  poultry  or  pig  operations  are  highly  automated  with•

climate control, feeding, egg collection, etc., all mechanized – one person can manage far more
animals than before.
Vertical Farming and Controlled Environment Ag:  These are essentially automated plant factories
– e.g., hydroponic or aeroponic systems in warehouses or greenhouses where lighting, nutrients,
and climate are computer-controlled. In some cases, seeding, transplanting, and harvesting are
done by machines or minimal labor . The earlier example of  Spread’s planned lettuce factory in
Japan  was telling: they aimed for a farm with no farmers , producing 30,000 heads of lettuce a day
with robots handling planting, transplanting, and harvesting . The plan was to reduce labor by
50% compared to their already partially automated farms and produce millions of heads of lettuce a
year with just a few human supervisors . That factory (Techno Farm) was scheduled around
2017–2018 and indeed such indoor farms are now in operation, though they often still have some
workers for maintenance and packaging. The principle stands: a combination of robotics and climate
control can greatly reduce traditional farm labor (no field workers, just a small crew in a clean facility
overseeing automated grow racks).
Given  these  tech  advancements,  the  next  5–10  years  in  agriculture  could  see  something  of  a  second
revolution where digital and robotic tech handles tasks that were left after mechanization . Historically,
mechanization took care of large-scale staple crops (grains, etc.), but specialty crops (fruits/veggies) and
certain tasks (weeding, pruning) still needed people. Now those are being addressed with robotics and AI.
The labor-intensive segments of agriculture (like fruit picking) face labor shortages and high costs in many
countries (e.g., fewer migrant workers available, or stricter labor laws). That economic pressure makes a
strong case for adopting robots despite high capital costs. There have been trials where a vineyard used
vine-pruning  robots  or  a  tomato  greenhouse  used  robotic  pollinators  (replacing  the  need  to  use
bumblebees). Each successful use case can chip away at the workforce numbers.
Economic Implications
If autonomous machinery becomes mainstream, a single farmer might manage what used to be dozens of
farmworkers’ worth of operations. It’s possible to conceive of a future “farm office”  where one operator
monitors a fleet of autonomous combines harvesting across fields via drone feeds, intervening only if
something goes wrong. Maintenance becomes the main human job (repairing robots, refueling/refilling
seed/fertilizer). Indeed, some large farms already operate almost like that – using GPS-guided equipment
that practically drives itself, the operator is there mostly for safety and small adjustments.
The cost benefit for farmers is significant: labor is a major cost especially for fruit & vegetable farms.
Automation can save those costs and mitigate the risk of labor unavailability. There’s also timing benefits –
e.g., harvesting promptly at peak ripeness is crucial and sometimes limited by available pickers; machines
could work nonstop to get it done in the ideal window.
One  measure  of  agricultural  efficiency  is  output  per  worker .  This  has  skyrocketed  historically  and  will
continue to climb if these automations spread. The social implication was moving labor to cities – but within
the farm sector , it meant consolidation (fewer , larger farms). From a business viewpoint, the fact that <2% of
people produce food for 100% is a success of “optimal employees ~ minimal”.•

Lights-Out Farming and Limitations
Could farms become fully “lights-out” like factories? Possibly indoor farms could, as they are controlled
environments  (the  Spread  lettuce  farm  aimed  for  essentially  that).  Outdoor  farming  is  trickier  due  to
weather , variability, and the need for judgment calls (e.g., deciding if apples are ripe enough). However , with
AI improvements, even those judgments may be approximated by sensors. Companies are developing AI
crop analysis  that tells the best harvest day based on images/sensor data, etc., something a skilled farmer
used to do by eye.
One interesting initiative is the concept of an autonomous farm swarm  – many small robots tending fields
continuously (planting, weeding, picking). Instead of one big tractor , you might have a dozen smaller bots. If
that becomes reliable, farming could indeed run largely on autopilot, with humans only coming in for
oversight or to handle exceptions (like a robot stuck in mud or needing repair).
Constraints include the high upfront cost of these machines and tech, which not all farmers can afford
without scale or financing, and some tasks remain hard for robots (like delicate picking in cluttered foliage,
or handling livestock birthing). So near-term, not every farm will be employee-free. But the trend is that
fewer and fewer workers are needed per acre or per ton of produce . Traditional farms might reduce
seasonal hires as machines fill in. New farming ventures might design their process around automation
from the ground up.
In conclusion, agriculture historically validated the principle of minimal labor for efficiency, and current
trends suggest an acceleration towards even fewer workers. Already, in many developed countries, farms
are run by a small family with lots of machinery. The next step is that some of that machinery won’t even
need drivers or constant human operation – getting us closer to the “zero labor farm” ideal. For the purpose
of  our  analysis,  agriculture  is  a  clear  example  where  the  “optimal  number  of  employees”  for  basic
production has shrunk dramatically and might approach zero for certain operations (like a robot-tended
greenhouse or a drone-operated field) in the coming decade or two.
Now, we move to  healthcare , a sector often cited as requiring the human touch and thus somewhat
resistant to full automation, but where business incentives are leading to significant automation in certain
tasks nonetheless.
Healthcare: Automation Augments Care, But Humans Still Essential
(For Now)
Healthcare is a sector where the demand for human labor has historically grown, not shrunk, despite
technological advances. This is largely because healthcare involves complex, personal interactions and
critical judgments about life and health – areas that have been less automatable. However , automation and
AI are increasingly infiltrating healthcare operations, aiming to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and cut
costs for providers. From a pure business perspective, healthcare institutions (hospitals, clinics, labs) do
look for ways to automate routine tasks to control labor costs (which are a huge portion of healthcare
expenses). But unlike an assembly line, patients often require empathy, ethical decisions, and unpredictable
problem-solving,  so  the  “optimal”  number  of  employees  in  healthcare  is  nowhere  near  zero  in  the
foreseeable future. That said, certain roles within healthcare  might see labor minimized through technology.
36
Automation in Diagnostics and Lab Work
One area of healthcare benefiting from automation is diagnostics and laboratory analysis . Medical labs
have long used automated analyzers for blood tests, chemistry panels, etc. A single lab technician with
modern equipment can run hundreds of samples in an hour – something that would have taken a large
staff manually in the past. Automation in labs reduces the number of lab technologists needed per test. For
example, large core labs in hospitals use track systems where blood vials go on a conveyor , machines
aliquot them, perform tests, and output results digitally, with minimal human intervention beyond loading
samples and maintaining machines.
Pathology  – examining tissue samples – is on the cusp of automation with digital pathology and AI.
Scanners can digitize microscope slides, and AI algorithms are being developed to detect cancerous cells or
other abnormalities. In trials, AI systems have shown promise in tasks like identifying metastases in lymph
node slides for cancer patients. If such systems become reliable, a pathologist might use AI as a first
screener or even delegate simpler cases entirely, thereby handling more cases with the same staff (or fewer
pathologists needed for same volume).
Radiology  is another field of interest. Modern radiology is already semi-automated in acquisition (e.g., MRI
and CT machines automatically capture images), but interpretation has been human. Lately, AI (especially
deep learning) has demonstrated the ability to read medical images for certain conditions nearly as well as
experts in narrow cases – for instance, identifying certain lung nodules on CT, or diabetic retinopathy in eye
scans. One study by Stanford showed an AI could detect pneumonia on chest X-rays at a level comparable
to radiologists. While AI isn’t replacing radiologists yet, it can triage or flag findings , potentially allowing
radiologists to focus on complex cases. An AI might pre-read all normal scans and only pass along ones
with suspected issues to the doctor . In fact, an AI tool tested for chest X-rays was able to identify normal X-
rays  and  could  cut  radiologists’  workload  by  about  20%–40%  by  filtering  out  those  cases .
Another trial in mammography screening suggested an AI-as-second-reader strategy could safely reduce
radiologists’ workload by up to 70%  in screening programs . If implemented widely, screening
programs might use half or fewer radiologists than today, because AI handles much of the detection.
In  pharmacy ,  many  hospitals  have  installed  robotic  pharmacy  systems  that  automatically  dispense
medications, fill pill bottles or unit doses, and package them for patients. This reduces the number of
pharmacists or pharmacy techs needed to manually count pills and retrieve drugs. Hospitals also use
medication  carousel  systems  and  barcode  checks  to  automate  as  much  of  the  dispensing  process  as
possible (enhancing safety and requiring fewer hands).
Surgery  has seen the rise of robotic surgical systems like the da Vinci robot . It is important to clarify these
are  not  autonomous;  they  are  surgeon-operated  telemanipulators.  They  don’t  reduce  the  number  of
surgeons (still one per patient), but they can improve precision or allow new minimally invasive approaches.
However , researchers are working on more automation in surgery – e.g., orthopedic surgery has some
robots that autonomously drill or align implants under supervision (like for knee replacements, some
systems can do the bone cuts with robotic guidance). In time, certain straightforward procedures could
become highly automated (though likely still with a human in the loop for oversight).9798

Administrative and Support Automation in Healthcare
A large part of healthcare costs and staffing is administrative: billing, coding, scheduling, documentation.
These areas are being automated with IT systems and AI:
Electronic  Health  Records  (EHRs)  have  digitized  charting,  though  ironically  that  sometimes
increased doctors’ clerical burden, leading to doctors spending hours on data entry. Now, however ,
there are efforts to use speech recognition and AI scribes  to automatically transcribe and fill out
charts  from  doctor-patient  conversations.  Companies  like  Nuance  (now  Microsoft)  offer  AI  that
listens during visits and drafts clinical notes. This could reduce the need for medical scribes (humans
who  currently  accompany  doctors  to  do  documentation)  or  free  doctors  from  typing  so  much,
effectively giving them more patient time (meaning the practice can see more patients with same
staff).
Medical Coding and Billing : AI and RPA are being used to automatically code patient encounters for
insurance billing (reading the doctor’s notes/EHR and assigning ICD/CPT codes). Traditionally this
employed  many  medical  coders.  Automation  can  perform  a  chunk  of  this  faster  and  flag  only
uncertainties  for  human  coder  review,  potentially  handling  a  majority  of  cases  automatically.
Similarly, insurance claims processing can be automated to approve straightforward claims without
adjuster involvement.
Patient Scheduling and Triage : Chatbots (like Babylon Health or many health system websites now)
can do initial symptom triage and recommend whether a patient should see a doctor , go to ER, or
self-care, etc. This automates what might otherwise be a nurse advice line call. Some clinics use
automated appointment reminders and even self-scheduling systems that reduce scheduler staff
time. For example, Kaiser Permanente uses an automated phone/email system for routine follow-
ups and scheduling, which decreased no-shows and also cut the volume of calls their staff handle. 
Telemedicine platforms themselves can increase a single clinician’s efficiency by cutting overhead (no room
turnover , etc.), though that might not reduce the total doctors needed since they spend the same time per
patient, but it might reduce support staff per encounter .
Limits and the Human Element
Despite  these  automations,  healthcare  remains  very  human-centric  where  it  matters:  doctors,  nurses,
therapists, caregivers – their roles are not easily replaced. There are critical aspects of patient care requiring
empathy, complex decision-making with incomplete data, and ethical judgment. For instance,  nursing
involves not just technical tasks (some of which can be automated, like IV pumps or vital sign monitoring)
but also direct patient interaction, comfort, responding to unpredictable situations like a patient fall, etc.
Some hospitals have tried helper robots (like tug robots to carry linens or medications across halls, which
actually are used in many hospitals) to offload some tasks, but the core nursing functions still require
humans.
Personal care in health  (like bathing patients, feeding those who can’t feed themselves) is labor-intensive
and not automatable with current or near-term tech in a sensitive and safe way. Japan has tried to develop
eldercare  robots  given  its  aging  population,  but  so  far ,  robots  that  can  safely  lift  patients  or  provide
companionship are limited. •

Doctors  likewise  handle  complex  diagnostic  synthesis  and  patient  communication.  AI  can  assist  (like
suggesting likely diagnoses), but final decisions and discussions with patients are likely to stay with human
doctors due to legal, ethical, and trust reasons. For example, IBM’s Watson for Oncology was hyped to
provide treatment recommendations, but it didn’t revolutionize or replace oncologists as some thought; it
faced challenges and is no longer actively marketed. That underscores how non-trivial it is to fully automate
high-level medical decision-making.
However , business incentives  in healthcare still push automation where possible: hospitals under financial
pressure use tech to streamline operations. One might see smaller hospitals or clinics using telehealth
to centralize certain specialties  (one specialist can remotely cover multiple hospitals via video – effectively
one doctor doing the work of what might have required presence of several).
Also, healthcare  outcomes  can actually improve with certain automation: e.g., reducing medication errors
with barcodes and automated dispensing saves lives and money from adverse events. So the incentive is
not just cost but quality (which indirectly is financial because of pay-for-performance metrics and avoiding
malpractice).
Employment and Projections
Healthcare,  unlike  other  sectors,  has  seen  rising  employment.  For  instance,  the  U.S.  Bureau  of  Labor
Statistics projected that healthcare jobs would grow more than any other sector through the 2020s due to
aging populations. Automation may slow  the growth or change the mix (with more tech roles, fewer clerical
roles), but it’s unlikely to cause net job decline in healthcare in the near future because demand outstrips
what automation can replace.
That said, certain roles may decline: for example,  medical transcriptionists  have largely been reduced
thanks to speech-to-text. Unit clerks  (managing paperwork on hospital wards) are fewer now with EHRs.
Even some diagnostic specialties like  radiology  are sometimes feared to eventually face oversupply if AI
covers  basic  reads  (though  famously,  many  radiologists  have  said  “AI  won’t  replace  radiologists,  but
radiologists  who  use  AI  will  replace  those  who  don’t”  –  implying  a  synergy  rather  than  outright
replacement).
In the next 5–10 years, we may see:
AI triage and symptom checkers  widely used by insurance or health systems, possibly reducing
initial doctor or nurse consultations for mild issues. (But likely those were often not attended anyway
or people just Googled, so not huge job impact, maybe reduces calls to nurse advice lines.)
Increased automation in hospital supply chain  (robots delivering supplies in hospitals, automated
inventory management for medical supplies), which could reduce back-end staff.
Expanded use of robots in surgery and rehabilitation , but mostly as tools, not replacing surgeons
or therapists entirely.
Pharmacies  possibly going more mail-order with automated dispensing, thereby reducing retail
pharmacist and tech headcount per prescription filled. Some pharmacies already have central fill
centers where robots fill 90% of scripts and ship to local pharmacies for pickup.•

The  McKinsey sector automation potential  placed healthcare among the  least susceptible  sectors
because so much time is spent on managing people, applying expertise, and unpredictable tasks – all
categories  with  low  automation  potential  (only  ~18-26%  automation  potential  for  those  tasks  as  per
McKinsey) . Indeed, caring for a patient or making complex diagnostic calls fall in those low-automation
categories.  McKinsey’s  estimate  was  that  perhaps  36%  of  healthcare’s  activities  could  technically  be
automated (which is lower than sectors like manufacturing or retail, but still a sizable chunk) . Many of
those are the administrative and routine diagnostic tasks we described. So we can expect automation to
handle around a third of tasks – which means healthcare workers might either handle more patients (if
demand is there) or do more high-value parts of their jobs rather than rote tasks.
From a pure economic standpoint of a healthcare business (like a private hospital), the goal is to automate
whatever doesn’t require a caring human touch , to cut costs in a tight reimbursement environment. So
they’ll invest in things like billing automation, robots for transport, AI to reduce radiology staffing nights,
etc. But they will likely not reduce the number of nurses per patient on a ward drastically any time soon
because there’s no safe replacement for that in-person vigilance and care.
Thus, for our hypothesis, healthcare illustrates  both sides : lots of automation in the “back office” and
diagnostics improving efficiency (which aligns with fewer employees needed for those functions), but the
core service of healthcare (treating and caring for patients) remains labor-intensive and relatively protected
from full automation in the near term. The “optimal” number of employees in healthcare is not trending to
zero in aggregate – if anything, healthcare as a whole will probably employ more people in 10 years than
now because of higher demand – but each of those people might be more augmented by tech, and certain
supporting roles will diminish.
In  summary,  healthcare  businesses  use  automation  to  augment  rather  than  replace :  they  seek
operational efficiency and cost control, but ultimately the business incentive is also to ensure quality of care
which often means keeping skilled humans involved. Automation in healthcare is thus often about  doing
more with the same number of clinicians  (or slightly fewer in support roles) rather than eliminating the
human factor entirely. 
Having  examined  all  these  sectors,  we  will  now  discuss  cross-cutting  case  studies  of  aggressive
automation , and then address  counterexamples and where labor remains superior , to balance the
analysis.
Case Studies of Aggressive Automation and Workforce Reduction
Throughout the industry discussions, we’ve mentioned numerous cases of companies pushing the envelope
of automation to drastically cut labor needs. Here, we compile a few standout examples across different
sectors that illustrate what highly automated operations look like and the real-world outcomes in terms of
workforce:
FANUC  “Lights-Out”  Robot  Factory  (Manufacturing):  FANUC,  a  Japanese  robotics  company,
famously operates a factory where industrial robots build other robots with virtually no human
intervention . It’s reported that this factory can run unsupervised for stretches of 30 days or more,
only  occasionally  requiring  a  human  to  come  in  for  maintenance  or  to  start  a  new  batch  of
production . In essence, FANUC achieved a feedback loop of automation: robots + automated
machining  produce  the  parts  and  assemble  new  robotic  units.  This  case  shows  that  for  highly74

repetitive and precise tasks (building standardized robot models), the optimal number of on-site
workers was essentially zero. Humans are only in the loop to program the production and maintain
the machines, often remotely. The result is a very high productivity and consistent output factory.
Other  companies  have  since  emulated  aspects  of  this  –  for  example,  Siemens  runs  a  highly
automated electronics factory in Amberg, Germany  where products communicate with machines
to direct their own manufacturing steps, resulting in minimal human oversight and a tiny error rate.
Siemens states that facility is ~75% automated.
JD.com Fully Automated Warehouse (Logistics/Retail):  JD.com’s Shanghai warehouse (3700 m^2)
employs only 5 technicians to handle maintenance for a team of 20 robots , replacing what would
have  been  around  500  warehouse  workers  in  a  conventional  setup .  The  warehouse  uses
automated conveyor systems, robotic arms for sorting, and AGVs (automated guided vehicles) for
moving  goods.  Orders  are  processed  end-to-end  by  machines,  with  the  technicians  ensuring
everything runs smoothly. This is a true case of a “dark warehouse” – JD even turned off the lights for
a  demonstration  since  the  robots  don’t  need  them.  The  facility  reportedly  operates  at  higher
throughput and lower error rates than human-based ones. Off the success of such facilities, JD.com
has continued to invest in automation to meet China’s enormous e-commerce demand without
proportional labor expansion. Similarly, Alibaba’s Cainiao network  has robot-operated warehouses
with hundreds of robots working collaboratively, significantly reducing human labor during peak
events like Singles’ Day . These illustrate that large-scale distribution can be handled with a small
caretaker crew and a lot of machines.
Foxconn  Automated  Factory  (Electronics  Manufacturing):  Foxconn,  known  for  assembling
iPhones and other electronics, has been automating some of its massive factories. In 2016, one
factory in Kunshan, China replaced 60,000 workers with robots in various assembly tasks . While
Foxconn still had over a million employees at the time, this was a clear sign of their direction. They
publicly stated plans to automate 30% of production by 2020  (and even more beyond) . Foxconn
has been building what it calls “Foxbots” – its own robotic arms – to deploy on lines. In those lines,
instead of hundreds of workers doing repetitive assembly or inspection, a handful of technicians
oversee robotic cells. This shift came after years of rising labor costs and incidents highlighting labor
conditions;  automation  was  both  an  economic  and  PR-driven  move.  Another  Apple  supplier ,
Pegatron , likewise invested in automated lines. The results are factories that, while not totally lights-
out,  employ  significantly  fewer  direct  assembly  workers.  Foxconn’s  journey  shows  the  practical
challenges too – not everything can be automated cheaply yet, so they tend to automate in phases,
targeting the most repetitive tasks first.
“CaliBurger”  Fully  Autonomous  Restaurant  (Food  Service):  In  late  2023,  Miso  Robotics  and
CaliGroup launched what might be the first quick-service restaurant where essentially all cooking
and order processing is automated (CaliBurger Pasadena).  Robotic cooking equipment (Flippy
robots) prepare the burgers and fries , conveyors assemble parts of orders, and customers use
kiosks to order and pay . The restaurant touted having almost no human workers needed in the
kitchen or at checkout. While they likely keep a staff member on site for oversight, cleaning, and
refilling ingredients, this represents a reduction of about 3-6 staff that a similar restaurant would
normally have. If scaled, one employee could potentially supervise multiple such automated stands.
Another  example,  McDonald’s  “Automation  Concept”  restaurant  in  Texas ,  heavily  uses
automation:  it  features  a  conveyor  belt  drive-thru ,  automated  beverage  filling,  and  kiosks  –
resulting in minimal staff mainly just assembling certain items and handing out orders. Early reviews•

noted the drive-thru has no human interaction at all. These cases are limited pilots, but they are
pathfinders for labor-lite fast food. They aim to maintain throughput and consistency with few
workers (solving the issue of staff shortages and wages creeping up). The success or failure of these
will inform how far widespread chains go.
Henn-na Hotel Robot Staff (Hospitality):  The Henn-na Hotel in Japan opened with over 240 robotic
“employees”  performing  front-desk  check-in,  luggage  transport,  room  service,  and  even
entertainment. Initially, it allowed the hotel to run with a very small human crew for security and
robot maintenance. It demonstrated initial viability: guests could check in at a robot receptionist and
have  their  bags  carried  by  a  porter  robot,  with  no  bellhop  or  front-desk  clerk.  However ,  as
mentioned, they eventually had to “fire” over half the robots and bring back humans  because
the automation wasn’t as smooth as hoped. Some tasks proved too complex or the robots too error-
prone (e.g., the concierge robot couldn’t answer many questions, the room assistant mis-activated
often). So this case study is a bit cautionary: it attempted near-zero staffing and found the tech
needed refinement. Still, the hotel continues to use some robots and remains a testing ground for
hospitality automation. It highlights that while the goal  was minimal employees, maintaining service
quality required a hybrid approach. The concept of a mostly robot-run hotel remains intriguing for
cost savings in an industry with tight margins, and we can expect others to try as robot intelligence
improves.
Goldman Sachs Automated Trading (Finance):  Goldman’s reduction of equity traders from 600 to
2, replaced by automated trading systems and supporting engineers, is a striking case of white-
collar automation . The fixed income and currency trading desks at many banks have undergone
similar transformations to electronic trading platforms. Additionally, many hedge funds moved from
discretionary  human  decision-making  to  quantitative  models  run  by  computers.  One  could  cite
Bridgewater Associates’ AI efforts  or  Two Sigma’s quant funds  – they manage tens of billions
with relatively few investment decision-makers, leaning on algorithms. While these finance firms still
have  significant  employees  in  technology  and  other  roles,  the  nature  of  trading  and  portfolio
management in those contexts is such that the “line employees” (traders/analysts making calls) are
replaced  by  code.  It’s  a  case  where  the  product  (capital  markets  trading/profit)  can  be  largely
delivered by automated strategies, overseen by far fewer humans, which significantly lowered the
cost per trade handled (good for competitiveness and profits).
Dutch Automated Greenhouse (Agriculture):  Companies like  Priva and Lely  in the Netherlands
have championed automated agriculture. A case in point: some large Dutch tomato greenhouses
employ automation for climate, watering, and even use harvesting trolleys and packing machines. A
reported  example  had  a  greenhouse  of  several  hectares  requiring  only  a  handful  of  people  to
monitor the system and do specialized tasks, whereas traditionally that area would have needed
dozens of pickers. Another is a  Japanese rice farm (Inaho)  that started using a robot for rice
transplanting and drone spraying, cutting labor needs by 50%. While not completely labor-free,
these examples show halving or more of workforce due to automation. 
Each of these cases, in their domain, shows that businesses can indeed function with drastically reduced
human staff when they aggressively apply current automation tech . They also illustrate the benefits
(cost  savings,  often  speed  or  consistency  gains)  and  some  pitfalls  (technical  limitations,  maintenance
burdens, or customer acceptance issues). •

Not every company can or will automate to these extremes, but these trailblazers set expectations. They
also often prompt competitors to adopt similar automation to stay cost-competitive. For instance, Amazon’s
robotics in warehouses pushed other retailers and logistics firms to invest in robots to keep up.
Next, we will consider counterexamples and scenarios where automation hasn’t reduced headcount as
expected or where human labor remains advantageous , to provide a balanced view and conditions
under which the hypothesis might not hold true or is delayed.
Counterexamples and Limits: When Humans Remain Economically
Superior
While the trend across industries is clearly toward greater automation and lower relative labor needs, there
are notable exceptions and situations where increased automation has not translated into fewer employees
– sometimes it even correlates with more employees (due to expanded output or new roles). It’s important
to examine these  counterexamples  to understand the constraints and where the “optimal number of
employees is zero” hypothesis breaks down, at least in the short to medium term. 
Automation Creating New Jobs or Shifting Roles
One famous paradox was the ATM and bank teller story  we discussed . The introduction of ATMs
did not immediately wipe out teller jobs. Instead, because ATMs made it cheaper to run branches (fewer
tellers per branch), banks opened more branches to reach more customers. For a couple of decades, the
number of tellers actually  increased slightly  even as ATMs proliferated . The ATMs changed the teller’s
role to be more about relationship and sales (since routine cash handling was offloaded) . This is a case
where  automation led to a redeployment of labor  rather than elimination, and actually spurred an
expansion of service that kept employment stable. Only later , as online banking further reduced branch
importance and banks saturated the market, did teller numbers decline. This example underscores that the
broader economic response to automation can be complex: cost reductions might lower prices or expand
services,  increasing  demand  and  thus  potentially  maintaining  employment  in  the  sector  (at  least
temporarily). 
Another case:  E-commerce vs. retail jobs . One might expect that e-commerce would reduce total retail
employment because of efficiency. To some extent it has shifted jobs from stores to warehouses and
delivery.  But  interestingly,  at  macro  scale,  the  growth  of  e-commerce  created  new  roles  (warehouse
associates, delivery drivers, IT, customer support for online retail) that offset some loss in traditional retail
jobs.  For  much  of  the  2010s,  the  total  combined  employment  of  “retail  +  warehousing”  didn’t  drop
precipitously; warehousing jobs grew strongly, compensating for retail store job stagnation. Essentially,
automation in retail changed the distribution of jobs  (fewer in storefronts, more behind the scenes),
rather than simply cutting the total one-for-one. Amazon is a prime example: it heavily automated parts of
warehousing, but it also massively increased volume such that it still hired hundreds of thousands of people
(albeit fewer than it would have needed without automation). 
However , as automation technology matures further (like robots that might reduce those warehouse jobs
eventually),  we  might  see  a  net  decline.  But  the  transition  period  can  feature  job  shifts  rather  than
immediate net loss.1617

Technical and Practical Limits
Some tasks remain technically very hard to automate reliably, to the point that keeping humans is more
cost-effective  or  necessary  for  quality.  Elon  Musk’s  Tesla  Model  3  production  is  a  good  case  of  over-
automation  backfiring .  Musk  attempted  to  automate  processes  like  flexible  wiring  harness
installation and complex final assembly tasks that robots struggled with. The automated conveyor system
they built turned out to be slower and less adaptable than humans, causing bottlenecks . He famously
admitted “humans are underrated” . Tesla had to add humans back to the lines to troubleshoot and do
tasks that the automation couldn’t handle. The lesson here is that when the environment or task is not
highly  structured,  humans  still  outperform  robots  in  flexibility  and  problem-solving .  For  highly
customized products or rapidly changing designs, full automation can be a mistake if reprogramming and
integration costs outrun labor costs. Thus, the “optimal” number of humans in such scenarios isn’t zero –
there’s an optimum mix where humans fill in the gaps machines can’t.
Another well-known case:  Walmart’s withdrawal of shelf-scanning robots . Walmart found that
employing robots to scan inventory wasn’t yielding enough benefit over human workers who could do it
during their normal course of work (especially once the pandemic increased the number of workers picking
online  orders  in  aisles,  who  could  double  to  report  out-of-stocks) .  Also,  there  were  hints  Walmart
worried how customers perceive robots in stores . So here, even though the technology worked, the
business case wasn’t strong enough. Humans turned out to do “just as well” for now . So the immediate
optimal solution was to redeploy humans efficiently rather than invest in robots chain-wide. This may
change as tech improves or wages rise, but it’s a current counterexample where more automation was tried
and then scaled back.
Hospitals and healthcare  illustrate limits strongly – you can add lots of tech, but you often still need
similar staffing ratios for safety and care quality. For instance, adding patient monitoring alarms didn’t
enable one nurse to handle twice as many patients; in fact it introduced alarm fatigue and often required
even a “monitor tech” role to watch the alarms. Many hospitals discovered that technology in practice
required  new  human  roles  to  manage  it  (like  EHR  documentation  demands  led  to  hiring  scribes).  So
ironically, some automation in healthcare initially created as much work as it saved. Now they’re refining it
(like using AI to truly lighten documentation). But it shows that in complex socio-technical systems, naive
automation can shift burdens or even increase workload if not done carefully. 
Quality and brand considerations  can also limit labor reduction. Some companies choose to use humans
even if automation exists, for differentiation. For example, high-end restaurants won’t replace waiters with
tablets because part of their value is human service. Some retailers highlight having knowledgeable staff as
a  selling  point  (e.g.,  boutique  stores,  or  associates  who  offer  fashion  advice).  In  those  cases,  even  if
automated checkouts or AI styling could be used, they might keep humans for the brand experience. The
“business incentive” there is customer satisfaction and loyalty, which can outweigh pure cost-cutting. We
see this in certain hospitality segments too – luxury hotels won’t replace concierges with kiosks, because
personalized service is their hallmark (unless all competitors did and they had to follow, but likely not). So in
segments where human touch is a core part of the value proposition, the optimal number of employees is
not zero; having zero could reduce profitability because customers leave. 
There's also a phenomenon where automation increases capacity and demand , which can paradoxically
keep or even increase employment. For instance, when manufacturing becomes more efficient, product
prices drop, which can increase demand, requiring more production. This could lead to hiring in other areas5152

44
(or even in manufacturing if scale outruns productivity gains). Historically, that’s how overall employment
hasn’t collapsed even as productivity rose – new jobs emerged due to higher output and new industries.
Specifically,  the  personal  computing  revolution  automated  many  office  tasks  (typewriters  to  word
processors, etc.), yet it created whole new industries (IT, software) employing millions. Those new jobs often
require  higher  skill,  but  they  did  fill  the  gap.  So  at  a  macro  level,  the  number  of  employees  doesn’t
necessarily trend to zero even if each business tries to minimize – people shift to tasks machines can’t do
yet, often in new fields or in improving/marketing the automated products.
Cheap labor availability  can slow or negate automation’s labor reduction. In parts of the world where
wages are very low and capital is expensive, businesses may find it optimal to keep using human labor
rather than automate, even if tech exists. For example, in garment manufacturing, sewing automation is
still limited; there are “sewbots” that can make simple garments, but many clothing items are still sewn by
hand in low-wage countries. It’s been more cost-effective to pay workers a few dollars a day than to invest
in robotics that might struggle with fabric flexibility. Thus, we have not seen sewing factories with zero
employees – instead, they shift to where labor is cheapest. However , as wages rise or technology improves
(like vision-guided sewing robots), this could change. Right now, though, the optimal number of employees
in, say, a Bangladesh garment factory is far from zero because the automation alternative isn't sufficiently
developed or cheap. Similar stories in agriculture: in some developing countries, it’s still cheaper to hire
many  farmhands  than  to  buy  a  tractor ,  so  they  haven’t  fully  mechanized  like  the  West  did.  That’s  an
economic reason why not all businesses will automate at the same pace – the trade-off varies.
Regulation and safety  can also force human presence. Autonomous vehicles might be capable in coming
years, but regulators may require a safety driver or limit usage initially. So a trucking company might want
zero drivers, but law might mandate one operator supervising multiple trucks remotely at least. That could
still cut labor by 80%, but not all the way to zero if oversight is compulsory.
Social acceptance and trust : Businesses sometimes hold back on replacing too many people due to fear of
customer backlash or political pressure. For instance, fully automated customer service might frustrate
some demographics enough to harm business, so a company keeps some human reps. Or a bank might
keep some branches open to maintain a public image of accessibility even though cost-wise they could
push everyone online.
In summary, the main counterarguments to “zero employees” are: - Human flexibility/adaptability where
tech is inflexible  – humans remain better or cheaper for unstructured tasks. -  Quality of experience
needing humans  – brand differentiation or complexity requiring empathy/judgment. - Initial automation
not as effective as expected  – requiring human re-introduction (as Tesla found). - Economic expansion
effects  – automation lowers costs which can increase demand or spawn new tasks for humans, reallocating
labor rather than eliminating it immediately. - External constraints  – regulatory, cultural, or labor market
conditions that favor keeping humans in the loop.
Even with those caveats, the overall direction is still that businesses will incrementally automate more
tasks as soon as it makes business sense , and these counterexamples often represent either transitional
issues or areas where tech isn’t yet up to the job. As technology advances, some of today’s limits will be
overcome (e.g., AI might handle more of the “human touch” via better natural interaction – perhaps not
emotional care, but routine social interactions maybe). 
45
A  balanced  perspective  is  that  the  equilibrium  number  of  employees  tends  toward  the  minimum
needed for the tasks that machines truly cannot do  profitably or acceptably. That minimum is above
zero in many cases, but it’s shrinking. In each industry, we identified core human roles that remain (creative
design, strategic management, complex caregiving, etc.), which for now set a floor on how few staff you can
have. For instance, a hospital will always need some nurses per patient; a creative studio might always need
some designers even if AI generates rough content. The hypothesis of “zero” is a theoretical extreme –
practically, maybe it means “as close to zero as feasible without hurting the business.” In some operations
like lights-out factories or algorithmic trading, that’s nearly zero. In others like healthcare, it's not close to
zero yet because humans are integral to the service.
Nonetheless, the pressure of competition means if one company figures out how to deliver similar value
with fewer workers (via tech), others must follow or get undercut. Over time, technology tends to expand
what can be automated (e.g., early AI couldn’t handle natural language, now it can to a degree), so those
human-exclusive domains shrink in scope.
The last section will conclude and summarize this deep analysis, tying together the insights from all sectors
and addressing the overarching question: is the optimal number of employees truly zero, and under what
conditions does that hold?
Conclusion
Across  industries  and  decades,  the  trajectory  is  unmistakable:  businesses  leverage  technology  to
minimize the human labor required  to produce goods and services, driven by the pursuit of efficiency,
consistency, and profit. The hypothesis that “the optimal number of employees is zero” is an exaggerated
way to express a real trend – firms incessantly seek to  optimize toward lower labor inputs , and as
technology capabilities grow, the asymptote of minimal necessary employees gets closer to zero in many
processes. 
In manufacturing, we saw that automation has enabled huge output with a fraction of the workforce of
earlier eras. Lights-out factories  and robotic assembly lines illustrate how, for repetitive production, the ideal
is  indeed  no  humans  on  the  shop  floor .  In  logistics,  automated  warehouses  and  impending
autonomous transport hint that the supply chain can keep flowing with very few people involved . In
services,  from  fast-food  kiosks  to  AI  customer  support,  routine  service  delivery  is  being  offloaded  to
machines, allowing companies to serve more customers with leaner teams . Software companies,
arguably the purest example, have demonstrated that  millions of users can be served by dozens of
employees or fewer  – an extreme validation of the idea that if you can automate the service itself, human
labor becomes almost superfluous .
Economically, the rationale is clear: human labor is a variable cost that technology can often reduce ,
turning  high  marginal  costs  into  low  fixed  costs  plus  relatively  cheap  operational  costs  (electricity,
maintenance). With automation,  scalability explodes  – an algorithm can handle an expanding workload
with  zero  extra  salary,  a  robot  can  work  multiple  shifts  without  overtime.  This  unlocks  growth  and
competitive pricing that labor-heavy models can’t match. In competitive markets, there’s strong pressure
for all players to automate to maintain margins if one player does so successfully. We’ve observed that in
auto  manufacturing  (widespread  robotics),  in  retail  (universal  self-checkouts  and  e-commerce),  and  in
banking (ubiquitous ATMs and online banking), among others.3644
4458
167
78
46
Crucially,  the transition period matters . In some cases, rather than immediate labor cuts, automation
enabled growth or reallocation. But over the long run, as industries mature, those redundancies often get
eliminated. The banking example showed a delayed effect – eventually, those extra branches closed and
tellers declined . We can surmise that in sectors currently adding jobs (like e-commerce warehouses), as
soon as automation passes certain thresholds of capability and cost, a phase of labor reduction or slower
labor growth will follow. We see early signs: Amazon’s astonishing robot fleet growth  suggests that
future fulfillment centers or expansion will rely proportionally more on machines than hiring 1:1 humans as
before. 
We must highlight that  “optimal” from a business perspective means profit-optimal, not necessarily
socially optimal . Businesses will pursue zero employees  to the extent it aligns with profit maximization .
Typically,  that  means  automating  up  to  the  point  where  the  marginal  cost  of  automation  equals  the
marginal benefit. If fully zero-human operation would cause, say, a loss of quality or customer trust that hits
revenue,  then  the  optimum  includes  some  humans.  Many  of  our  counterexamples  (Henn-na  Hotel,
Walmart’s shelf scanners, etc.) illustrate that premature or excessive automation can diminish returns .
Thus, while the direction  is toward fewer employees, the optimum  in practice might be a hybrid model. 
However , as technology improves, the breakeven shifts further . Tasks that needed a human for quality or
perception reasons might be automated acceptably with next-gen AI or better robotics. A decade ago, few
would trust an AI to drive a car; now we’re on the cusp of that being reality in limited domains. Similarly, an
AI’s emotional intelligence is limited today, but if future AIs could emulate empathy convincingly, perhaps
even caregiving or customer service could be done by robots without customer revolt. These advancements
would lower that human-involvement threshold further .
In  the  5–10  year  projection  horizon  across  industries:  -  Manufacturing  will  inch  closer  to  fully
autonomous  production  in  certain  high-volume  segments,  with  humans  mainly  as  overseers  and
maintenance  –  essentially  transitioning  many  from  laborers  to  engineers  and  technicians .  -
Logistics  will likely see pilot projects of driverless trucks and more dark warehouses, reducing logistics staff
needs notably . - Services  will experience more AI customer interaction and self-service, trimming
entry-level service jobs especially in call centers and retail checkout . - Software/Tech  will continue
high productivity with modest headcounts, possibly aided by AI in development, reinforcing the model of
huge leverage per employee. - Finance  will further automate trading and banking processes; we might see
a continued decline in certain finance roles like traders, brokers, and a lesser need for bank branch staff as
digital services dominate . - Retail  will get more cashierless and more online – likely net a decline in
physical retail jobs, partially offset by automated fulfillment centers (which themselves will move toward
needing  fewer  people) .  -  Agriculture  will  adopt  more  autonomous  machinery  and  robotics  in
advanced economies, possibly stabilizing or reducing farm labor even as output grows, finishing the job
mechanization started . - Healthcare  will automate numerous support tasks but probably re-deploy
human workers to direct care roles because demand is rising faster than automation can replace. Here the
equilibrium might shift more slowly; the optimal number of certain support employees might drop, but
total clinical staff might still rise due to aging populations.
Taking a step back: if we imagine the far future (beyond our 10-year scope), it’s conceivable that for many
sectors, the direct production or service delivery can be mostly automated. The “factory” of the future could
be a black box: raw materials in, products out, zero line workers. The “warehouse” of the future could be all
robots. The “store” of the future could be an automated showroom or entirely online. The “office” of the
future could have AI assistants doing the grunt work. Businesses in such a future would indeed have very76

few employees – perhaps just a small leadership, creative, and engineering team – or possibly even none in
the case of fully self-driving corporations (this is speculative, but one can imagine an AI-run investment
fund with no human employees, for instance). 
In essence, the  equilibrium number of employees trending toward zero  is a way of saying that  the labor
component of production costs is trending toward zero  as a fraction of total costs, due to automation.
We see that in productivity statistics – output per labor hour keeps climbing. For businesses, if they could
run with zero employees, they would capture maximum value (all revenue minus capital and input costs
would be profit, no wages to pay). In reality, there will always be some labor costs – at least until AI and
robotics reach science-fiction levels of general intelligence and capability – but those labor costs will be
focused in areas that either technology can’t do or where human involvement is part of the value.
Finally, it’s important to note that even as a given business might minimize its own workforce, on a macro
scale those displaced workers (and new entrants) historically found new employment in emerging sectors
(from agriculture to industry to services, and now to digital or green economies). So “zero employees
businesses” could proliferate in one domain, while new human-centric jobs appear in another (consider
how the tech industry created jobs like UX designer or data scientist that didn’t exist before). From a
business perspective , though, each firm’s goal is efficiency, not keeping people employed. So our analysis
supports  the  notion  that  each  company  will  keep  cutting  headcount  as  far  as  technology,  customer
acceptance, and regulation allow, approaching that minimal ideal.
In summary,  the business hypothesis stands: companies will continue to hire “only the minimum
number of employees necessary” , and as technology advances, that minimum keeps shrinking. In sector
after sector , we’ve witnessed a steady elimination of roles that become automate-able. The equilibrium
number of employees is not universally zero yet – and may never be absolutely zero in many fields – but it’s
trending in that direction for the purely technical components of work. The economically rational endpoint
is  a  business  that,  if  possible,  operates  fully  autonomously,  capturing  the  full  value  of  automation.
Companies are not quite there in most cases, but they are steadily moving along that path. 
The  cross-industry analysis  demonstrates this movement with concrete data: manufacturing output up
with fewer workers , warehouses run by 5 people instead of 500 , trading floors reduced from 600
traders to algorithms maintained by 200 engineers , restaurants run by robots flipping burgers , and
so on. Even agriculture, once the bastion of manual toil, now sees robot farmers on the horizon . The
counterexamples  teach us that the transition has friction and some domains resist full automation due to
complexity or human preference – but they don’t invalidate the core economic drive.
For expert readers and industry strategists, the implications are clear: plan for a future where automation
takes over more and more tasks, and design business models and workforce strategies accordingly .
This might mean upskilling workers to manage automation, focusing human labor on the truly value-add or
creative aspects, and continuously assessing new technologies for integration. Companies that successfully
integrate automation can achieve lower marginal costs and scalable profits – those that don’t may be left
behind competitively. From an economic and business standpoint, while zero employees is an extreme that
serves as a thought experiment, it’s a guiding star for efficiency. Each incremental step toward that –
whether it’s one less cashier , one less assembly worker , or one less analyst because a machine took over –
can contribute to the bottom line.15 44

In conclusion,  the age of automation continually redefines the “optimal” workforce size downward .
The evidence across industries supports the hypothesis that the equilibrium number of employees for many
business operations will keep decreasing. Fully “zero-employee” businesses might be rare in the near term
outside of narrowly defined enterprises (like algorithmic trading funds or certain automated web services),
but the minimal workforce model is expanding. Businesses will keep pushing that envelope as far as
technology, economics, and society will let them, because ultimately, in the calculus of profit maximization,
humans are an input cost – an input that, whenever possible, automation will reduce or eliminate in the
pursuit of efficiency .
