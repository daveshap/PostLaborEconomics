Labor’s Pendulum: Scarcity, Glut, and Power
Through World History
Introduction: The Tide of Labor Supply and Power
In the grand sweep of history, the fortunes of workers have often risen and fallen on the tide of labor
supply. When workers are few and in demand, their bargaining power swells – wages climb and conditions
improve. When workers are abundant or easily replaced, the opposite occurs: wages stagnate or fall, and
rights erode. This narrative arc has played out repeatedly across continents and centuries. After the Black
Death  ravaged  14th-century  Europe,  survivors  suddenly  found  their  labor  in  short  supply  –  and  they
leveraged that scarcity to demand higher wages and freedom from feudal bonds . In stark contrast,
on colonial plantations flush with enslaved or indentured laborers, or in industrial cities teeming with
unemployed workers, those who toiled had little power to negotiate and lived under grinding conditions.
Even in modern economies, a moderate oversupply of labor – whether due to globalization, recession, or
automation – has been enough to hold down pay and weaken job security . 
This historical report follows the swinging pendulum of labor supply and its effects on workers’ lives, from
ancient times  through the medieval plague era , the colonial age , the Industrial Revolution , the Great
Depression , and into the globalized 20th century  and technological 21st century . We will see in narrative
detail  how  labor  scarcity  empowered  common  people  –  and  how  labor  gluts,  even  moderate  ones,
undermined their position. Across Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas, the same thesis emerges: when
hands are few, those hands gain strength; when hands are many or easily replaced, they lose their grip on a
decent livelihood. In telling these stories, we draw on the voices of the past – chroniclers, economists,
workers themselves – to illustrate how profoundly shifts in labor supply have shaped wages, worker rights,
and bargaining power throughout history.
Scarcity and Survival After the Black Death (14th Century Europe)
In  the  middle  of  the  14th  century,  a  catastrophe  decimated  Europe’s  population  –  and  paradoxically
liberated the survivors. The  Black Death , a bubonic plague pandemic, swept through Europe starting in
1347 and killed at least one-third of the people . Whole villages were left silent. Fields went untilled for
lack of farmers; workshops sat idle for lack of craftsmen. For medieval peasants and laborers, it was the end
of  the  world  they  had  known  –  and  the  beginning  of  a  new  one.  Amid  the  horror  and  grief,  an
unprecedented  labor scarcity  had emerged. One English chronicler marveled (with aristocratic dismay)
that because workers were so few, “Aristocrats and high clergymen not only had to pay triple wages to
those toiling in their fields, but, even worse, they themselves had to perform manual labor” . The ruling
classes found the social order upended: suddenly the mighty imagined themselves forced to swing sickles
in their own fields, a spectacle of “unthinkable” inversion that underscored how severe the labor shortage
had become .
For the peasants who survived the plague, this inversion was very real. They understood that their labor
had become more valuable  in a depopulated world . Contemporary records show workers demanding12

– and receiving – higher wages in many places. In Rochester , England, a monkish chronicler recorded with
shock  that  lords  were  having  to  pay  three  times  the  usual  wage  to  field  laborers .  Across  Europe,
landowners and guild masters faced a “sharp increase in competition for workers” and found that laborers,
aware of their newfound scarcity,  “had increased bargaining power and commanded higher wages.” . In
manorial account rolls and city wage data from the late 1300s, historians indeed find evidence that wages
rose significantly in the decades after the plague . One economic analysis notes that in England, farm
wages roughly doubled between 1350 and 1450 . Real wages of English workers peaked at levels “not
again equaled until the 1880s” – a stunning fact suggesting how extraordinary the 14th-century gains were
.
Yet these gains did not come without struggle. Europe’s elites were deeply alarmed by the empowerment of
the lower classes. Rather than accept higher labor costs, the landed nobility and urban patricians fought to
hold back the tide. In England, King Edward III – pressured by landowners – issued the  Ordinance of
Labourers (1349) , followed by the Statute of Labourers (1351) , which aimed to freeze wages at pre-plague
levels  and  legally  compel  workers  to  serve  if  offered  work  at  those  old  wages .  The  Statute  of
Labourers forbade anyone to pay or receive higher pay than what prevailed in 1346, before the plague .
It also made it a crime for jobless peasants to refuse work or to leave their home village in search of a
better deal . This was essentially an attempt to reinstate the status quo ante  – to nullify the workers’
newfound bargaining power by decree.
Enforcement of these laws proved spotty (it’s hard to police every farm and town), and wages did rise  in
practice despite the statutes . Many peasants simply defied the law. In 1352, for example, the prior
of Bradenstoke complained that a man named Edward le Taillour “left his employment before the term was
up” and that another laborer demanded an “excess” wage of six shillings eightpence  for reaping a harvest .
Court records are filled with cases of workers moving to wherever wages were highest – in open “contempt
of the king”  and his statute . The authorities could accuse these laborers of being greedy or “idle” under
the law, but in truth they were doing rationally what their lords had long done: seeking the best price for
their work . 
The  tug-of-war  between  labor  and  elites  in  post-plague  Europe  sometimes  turned  violent.  When
subsequent generations of peasants saw their gains threatened by taxes and renewed feudal pressures,
they revolted – notably in the  English Peasants’ Revolt of 1381 . One cause of that uprising was the
lingering resentment that the laws had capped wages and tried to bind workers in place, denying them the
full fruits of labor scarcity . The rebels explicitly demanded the abolition of serfdom and the freedom
to work for wages of their choosing. Though the revolt was crushed, serfdom in England did continue to
wither in the century after the Black Death, partly because a free wage economy was taking hold in
response to the labor shortage . 
Elsewhere in Europe, similar dynamics played out. In Western Europe broadly, historians note that after the
plague, “wages rose, inequality decreased, feudalism ended.”  While that summary may be a bit simplified,
it captures the essence:  labor scarcity shifted power toward the lower classes . In Eastern Europe, by
contrast, where feudal landlords managed to clamp down harder , serfdom actually intensified after the 14th
century – illustrating that beneficial outcomes for workers were not automatic even with scarcity, but
required seizing opportunity. In the West, workers for a time enjoyed better diets, higher pay, and more
mobility than their forebears. A 14th-century Florentine chronicle notes that after the plague, many rural
laborers wore finer clothes and ate meat almost daily – small luxuries previously rare for the poor . The
equilibrium had changed: the *“common” laborer was no longer so common , and he knew it.**5

That new equilibrium, however , was not permanent. As decades and then centuries passed, populations
recovered. By the 1500s, European population growth was again abundant, and the advantage began
tipping back to landowners and employers. The temporary golden age for workers gradually eroded – elites
reasserted  control,  and  real  wages  eventually  declined  from  their  post-plague  heights .  As  one
historian put it, whatever gains peasants and artisans made in those plague decades “did not survive the
following centuries. Elites successfully reclaimed a greater share of wealth and income... and laborers’
power  diminished.”  In  other  words,  when  labor  became  abundant  again,  or  hierarchies  were
rebuilt, the old order reasserted itself . The pendulum had swung back. But the Black Death episode left
an indelible example of labor scarcity empowering the underclass – a lesson not lost on later generations. 
Before moving on, it’s worth noting that the phenomenon of catastrophe-induced labor scarcity wasn’t
unique to medieval Europe. Earlier in history,  plagues and population crashes often brought similar
effects . In the Roman Empire, the Antonine Plague  of the 2nd century (likely smallpox) killed millions and
caused severe manpower shortages; some scholars argue that in its wake, wages for free workers rose
considerably due to the scarcity of labor . Records from Roman Egypt after the plague hint at rising pay
for soldiers and workers as the state struggled to fill ranks . Likewise, the Plague of Justinian  in the
6th century depopulated large parts of the Byzantine Empire – one consequence was an interruption of
massive building projects and difficulty finding workers . These ancient cases are less documented than
the Black Death, but they suggest a recurrent pattern: when population drops suddenly, survivors gain
unusual leverage – at least until societal forces counteract it. 
The story of the Black Death’s aftermath, then, is a dramatic early chapter in the larger saga of labor scarcity
versus  labor  surplus.  It  shows  how  an  extreme  labor  shortage  translated  into  higher  wages,  lower
inequality,  and  more  worker  autonomy  (serfdom’s  decline)  –  but  also  how  quickly  the  powerful
fought back to restore “order .” As we turn to other eras, we will see the converse scenario – times and places
where workers were far too plentiful , and the grim consequences of those gluts. For if scarcity was a boon to
medieval peasants, labor abundance would prove a curse to many others .
Colonization and the Engineered Labor Gluts (16th–19th Centuries)
As European empires spread across the globe from the 1500s onward, they established economic systems
that often hinged on an  oversupply  of labor – sometimes a violently manufactured oversupply. In the
colonies of the Americas, in Africa, and in parts of Asia, European colonizers created or exploited large pools
of cheap labor to extract resources and agricultural wealth. This era offers some of history’s starkest
examples of how a labor glut can be engineered and how devastating its effects are on worker rights and
wellbeing.  Enslaved  Africans  on  New  World  plantations,  indigenous  peoples  forced  into  colonial
mines, and indentured servants shipped across oceans  all formed a massive surplus labor force with
virtually  no  bargaining  power .  The  consequences  included  depressed  (or  non-existent)  wages,  harsh
conditions, and long-term underdevelopment that lingered even after these coercive systems formally
ended.
Slavery in the Americas: Abundant Labor, Absent Rights
In the plantation economies  of the Caribbean, Brazil, and the American South, the supply of labor seemed,
from  the  planter’s  perspective,  inexhaustible.  After  Europeans  arrived  in  the  Americas,  indigenous
populations were initially enslaved or forced to work, but staggering disease-induced die-offs (another
tragic labor scarcity of sorts) led colonizers to seek new sources of manpower . They turned to the Atlantic2122

slave trade , which over four centuries transported an estimated 12 million Africans to the Americas in
chains. This flood of enslaved labor created a paradigmatic labor glut: planters had more workers than they
could ever acquire locally, and those workers had zero rights or bargaining power . If an enslaved person died or
resisted, the master could acquire another from the slave markets. Wages were irrelevant – enslaved people
toiled for no pay, under coercion. This  labor surplus under coercion  drove production booms in sugar ,
cotton, coffee, and other commodities, yielding enormous profits for plantation owners at horrific human
cost.
In economic terms, the planters enjoyed the fruits of an extremely elastic labor supply. For example, a
single sugar estate in 18th-century Jamaica or Saint-Domingue  (Haiti) might have hundreds of enslaved
workers, and the colonial system ensured replacements were available via continued slave imports if the
workforce dwindled. Because enslaved laborers could not leave or negotiate, planters had no need to
improve  conditions;  in  fact,  they  often  literally  worked  people  to  death,  then  bought  more.  One
contemporary observer in the British West Indies noted that it was cheaper for planters to overwork and
replace slaves  than to maintain them in the long run – a gruesome calculus only possible when a glut of
enslaved labor was readily obtainable. The result was that wages for free labor in those societies were also
depressed: why pay a free worker a decent wage when enslaved people (or indentured ones) could do it for
next to nothing? In this way, the abundance of unfree labor  undermined the position of any free laborers
as well. Society stratified sharply between the mostly white planters and the vast coerced workforce with
virtually no middle class in between.
Even after slavery was abolished in various colonies (the British Empire in 1834, French in 1848, US in 1865,
Brazil in 1888, etc.), the legacy of labor oversupply persisted in new forms. Plantation owners, desperate to
keep labor costs low in the absence of slaves, quickly turned to importing indentured laborers from other
populous parts of the empire. A telling example comes from the British Caribbean. When Britain ended
slavery,  “newly free men and women refused to work for the low wages on offer on the sugar farms”  –
understandably, former slaves sought better than the pittance plantation owners were willing to pay. In
response, beginning in the 1830s, British colonies imported some 2 million indentured workers from
India (and smaller numbers from China and elsewhere)  to create a fresh surplus of cheap labor .
These  indentured  laborers  –  derogatorily  called  “coolies”  –  signed  contracts  (often  under  misleading
pretenses or coercion) to work for 5 or more years on plantations in places like Trinidad, Guyana, Mauritius,
Fiji, and South Africa . They received meager wages, often below any free-market standard, and lived in
harsh, prison-like conditions not vastly different from slavery . The planters had essentially recreated a
labor glut  to replace the one slavery had provided. As a contemporary report noted, the Indian indentures
allowed the West Indian sugar estates to “recover”  after emancipation by ensuring a steady supply of cheap
labor  – thus undercutting the bargaining power of the newly freed Black workers who might otherwise
have successfully demanded higher pay .
The glut of labor in these colonial settings was not a natural occurrence; it was deliberately orchestrated.
Colonial powers imposed legal and fiscal pressures to force locals into wage labor  in Africa and Asia as
well. In many African colonies, officials used taxation as a lever: they imposed a  hut tax or head tax
payable only in cash , which effectively pushed subsistence farmers into working for European employers
to earn money for the tax . This created a pool of Africans who  had to seek work, swelling the labor
supply for mines and plantations. When even that was insufficient or too slow, outright  forced labor
policies  were introduced. In Portuguese Mozambique, for instance, the colonial government codified a
“moral obligation” for indigenous men to work – in practice conscripting tens of thousands of Africans
for plantation labor  each year . Companies like the Sena Sugar Estates had contracts whereby the state26
27
28

delivered quotas of forced laborers (3,000 every six months, in one case) to keep their operations fully
staffed . Research using archival records from Mozambique found that these  coerced laborers were
paid about 40% less  than what equivalent free workers would have earned . The coercion thus directly
depressed wages . It created an  artificial surplus  of labor by dragging people into the workforce on
unfavorable terms, ensuring that employers never faced a genuine shortage that might empower workers.
Similar practices occurred under French rule (the corvée system in Africa and Indochina), Belgian rule (the
infamous Force Publique in the Congo, which brutalized villagers into collecting rubber), and others. Across
these cases, labor was abundant from the perspective of the colonial enterprise – and thus exploited to
the hilt, with scant regard for rights or welfare .
It is important to note that not every colony always had a labor surplus; in fact, paradoxically, colonizers
often initially complained of labor “shortages” – meaning local people would not work for the pittance
offered. But the colonial response was not to raise wages to attract workers (as a competitive market might
dictate); instead it was to remove the locals’ alternatives  or compel their service, effectively manufacturing
the labor supply. As one historian summarized, “the crisis of wage labor was the main problem faced by all
European colonies in Africa. Solving the problem of labor shortage was the central obsession.”  They solved it
by force, turning a shortage into a surplus on their terms. The outcome for workers was uniformly grim:
low or no wages, long hours, unsafe conditions, and violent punishment if quotas were not met . In
the Congo Free State around 1900, for example, village men conscripted to gather wild rubber faced
mutilation or death if they failed to bring in enough – a gruesome illustration of total powerlessness of
labor under extreme coercion.
By the 19th century, industrializing colonial powers also used their home populations as a kind of pressure
valve on labor . Britain, for instance, encouraged millions of its surplus workers to  emigrate  to colonies
(Australia, Canada, South Africa, etc.) as settlers or laborers. This sometimes eased domestic labor gluts
(reducing unemployment or over-competition at home), but it exported those workers to colonial contexts
where they often formed a labor elite atop local populations. In British India, by contrast, there was an
internal labor glut – a huge population competing for limited formal employment. The colonial economy
there largely kept wages very low; occasional famines (due to both weather and policy failures) would kill
millions, and labor remained cheap. Late-19th-century India saw scant improvement in living standards
despite  the  global  economic  growth  of  that  era;  one  could  argue  the  labor  oversupply  –  alongside
exploitative  colonial  policies  –  meant  Indian  workers  had  weak  bargaining  power ,  especially  against
British planters or railroad companies that could hire from a vast pool of the poor . Indeed, observers often
commented that labor in India was “abundant and inexpensive,” which was one reason the British could
construct massive infrastructure (railways, canals) with relative ease – but also why Indian wages stayed
near subsistence.
In  sum,  the  colonial  period  demonstrates  how  deliberately  maintained  labor  surpluses  enabled
systematic underpayment and abuse . Whether through slavery, indenture, or forced wage labor , colonial
systems made sure there were more workers available than decent jobs or fair wages . The result was to
enrich the colonizers and domestic elites while stripping laborers of agency. Unlike the post-Black Death
peasants who could threaten to “vote with their feet” by leaving for higher pay, enslaved and colonized
workers typically could not escape  the system. The imbalance of supply (high) and options (low) left them
voiceless. As an extreme example of this voicelessness, one might consider that an enslaved field hand
picking cotton on a Mississippi plantation in 1850 had virtually the same “wage” (zero) and rights (none)
whether labor was scarce or plenty – but the slaveholders saw to it that  labor was never scarce  by
continually acquiring more slaves (through birth or purchase). The moderating effect of scarcity was thus33
34
35

negated  by the institution of slavery itself. And when emancipation threatened scarcity (as in the British
Caribbean), indenture was introduced to bloat the labor pool again . For free or freed workers of color ,
this meant any budding leverage they might have gained was immediately undermined by a new influx of
hands willing (or compelled) to work for little. Even moderate gluts  – say, a few thousand extra imported
laborers on an island – had  significant detrimental effects  on labor conditions, nullifying attempts by local
workers to seek better terms.
The broader legacy of these colonial labor practices has been long-lasting. In regions where labor was
super-abundant and cheap, economic development often skewed toward low-wage industries and extreme
inequality. When slavery in the United States ended, the South turned to sharecropping and convict labor to
keep a semblance of labor surplus (tied workers) and maintain planter control – effectively extending the
glut  conditions  by  other  means.  In  colonies  that  gained  independence  in  the  20th  century,  large
populations with limited employment opportunities often remained, a problem in many post-colonial states
as they struggled to industrialize. 
But even as colonies provided stark examples of labor glut oppression, a new kind of labor surplus was
emerging on the global stage – one tied to the rise of industrial capitalism. The scene shifts now to the
factories  of  the  Industrial  Revolution ,  where  a  burgeoning  working  class  found  itself  remarkably
numerous, and at the mercy of employers in ways that echoed some of the colonial dynamics (albeit
without  formal  slavery).  The  industrial  age  would  test  whether  the  pattern  held  true  in  the  modern
economy: would an oversupply of workers in cities lead to low wages and weak bargaining power? The
answer , as we shall see, was largely yes – at least until workers organized to counteract it.
The Industrial Revolution: Factories, Crowds, and “Surplus” Hands
(18th–19th Centuries)
In an oft-quoted passage from 1844, the young Friedrich Engels lamented the fate of workers in England’s
new industrial cities. He claimed that the medieval English peasant or artisan of past centuries had been
“far  better  off  than  his  successors  of  the  factories  of  the  1840s,”  living  a  “passably  comfortable
existence” compared to the misery of the industrial proletariat . Engels was observing the bitter reality of
the  Industrial Revolution ’s early decades: while factories were producing wealth on an unprecedented
scale, the ordinary workers saw little improvement in their wages or living conditions. In fact, for many their
situation worsened, at least initially. What explains this disconnect between increasing economic output
and stagnant or falling real wages for workers? One crucial factor identified by Engels and others was the
glut of labor  relative to the demand – in other words, a “reserve army” of workers that kept competitive
pressure on everyone’s wages. The rapid growth of population, combined with masses of people migrating
from rural areas to industrial centers, created a labor market where  workers were plentiful and thus
easily exploited .
The Flood of Workers into the Factories
Britain was the first industrializing nation, and from around 1760 to 1830 it underwent massive social
changes. Agricultural improvements had fueled a population boom in the 18th century, so by the time
textile mills and coal mines were hungry for labor , there were many hands available. Traditional livelihoods
(small farming, handcrafting) were being disrupted by enclosure and mechanization, pushing people off the
land.  These  dispossessed  rural  folk  and  a  new  generation  of  young  workers  poured  into  cities  like26
37

Manchester , Birmingham, and London seeking waged work. The result was that labor supply outpaced the
growth of good jobs  for a time. Employers, from cotton mill owners to coal mine operators, found they had
a long line of applicants at the gates , desperate enough to accept long hours and low pay. If any worker
demanded higher wages or went on strike, there were others willing to take the spot – a classic labor
surplus dynamic.
Economic data bear out what Engels and the Chartist reformers of the 1830s suspected: despite Britain’s
economy growing, real wages for workers barely budged for decades. Historians have dubbed this the
“Engels’ Pause” – a period roughly from the 1790s to 1840s when productivity and profits rose but ordinary
workers’ real wages stagnated . One quantitative study finds that in the first half of the 19th
century, British real wages were essentially flat while output per worker climbed, leading the share of
national income going to profits (owners) to increase markedly . In fact, Gregory Clark’s long-run wage
series shows that English workers in some trades did not consistently exceed their late-medieval wage
highs until the late 19th century . On the eve of the Industrial Revolution (c. 1750), real wages were
no higher than they had been in the early 1500s; by 1850, after 100 years of industrial growth, the average
working-class living standard had improved only marginally – maybe 15% higher than the 1780s, according
to one study . In short, most of the gains of the industrial boom initially went to industrialists and capital
owners, not to the laborers. Why? Contemporary commentators pointed to oversupply of labor and the
power imbalance it caused . 
Factories could hire women and children as well as men, vastly expanding the potential labor force and
further  augmenting the labor surplus . Indeed, the use of child labor was rampant – not just because
children could be paid less, but also because there were so many poor families willing (or needing) to send
their kids to work. In 1815, an observer might see seven-year-old children darting around the spinning
machines in a cotton mill , earning a pittance for 12 hours of work, or entire families trudging into a coal
mine before dawn. The overabundance of labor at the factory gates meant that if one worker dropped from
exhaustion or lost a finger in a machine, a new hire could be made in an instant. Jane Humphries, an
economic historian, notes that during the early Industrial Revolution the pressure of population growth and
lack of worker bargaining power led to widespread use of child labor , which itself then reinforced  low wages
by  undercutting  adult  male  workers’  wage  demands  (since  a  child’s  wage  could  supplement  a  family
income) . The whole system thus kept labor cheap. 
Working conditions in this era were famously horrific. A British parliamentary report from 1832 on child
labor in factories detailed children as young as six beaten to keep them awake on the job, deformities
caused by endless standing, and workers forced to eat on the run to keep the machines constantly running.
Why did such conditions persist with impunity? Largely because employers held all the cards in a labor-
abundant  market .  Labor  was  treated  as  a  cheap,  replenishable  input.  If  one  village’s  supply  was
exhausted, industrialists knew that Ireland or the rural counties or the European continent had thousands
more willing to come. The early 19th century also saw an influx of Irish immigrants into English industrial
towns (especially after the 1840s famine) – another stream adding to the labor pool and putting downward
pressure on wages in Britain.
On the  European continent , similar processes occurred slightly later . In Belgium, Germany, and France,
rapid  population  growth  after  1800  combined  with  fitful  industrialization  meant  periods  where  labor
outstripped jobs. In the 1840s, Europe experienced a continent-wide economic crisis (“the Hungry Forties”)
with high unemployment; discontented workers and the urban poor helped fuel the Revolutions of 1848 .
Those upheavals were in part a reaction to the social ills of nascent industrial capitalism – low wages, job3839

insecurity, and political exclusion of the working class – all exacerbated by the perception (and reality) that a
surplus  of  workers  kept  them  expendable.  The  famous  revolutionary  slogan,  “Bread  or  work!”,
encapsulates the desperate choice facing unemployed masses.
Karl Marx, writing in the late 1840s and 1850s, formalized the concept of the “reserve army of labor”  – a
permanently  unemployed  or  underemployed  segment  of  the  workforce  that  capitalists  maintain
(inadvertently, through competition) which serves to depress wages for those employed. He drew this from
observing England’s economy, noting that whenever industry cycled down, unemployment surged, and
even in good times there were more workers than jobs requiring their full capacity. This “reserve army,”
Marx argued, was what kept wages at mere subsistence, as workers knew there were always others ready
to take their place if they demanded more pay . In other words, labor glut was a feature, not a bug, of
the capitalist system , ensuring profits stayed high and workers’ bargaining power low. One does not have
to subscribe fully to Marx’s theory to see its reflection in the events of the 19th century: periods of labor
shortage (like wartime demand spikes) did see wages rise slightly, but long-run trends until late century
showed wages largely constrained by the large labor supply.
Turning the Tide: Organization and Scarcity
By the second half of the 19th century, some factors began to shift this dynamic in industrialized countries.
Population  growth  eventually  slowed  and  emigration  to  the  Americas  relieved  some  European  labor
surpluses. Workers also began to organize into trade unions  and press for legal limits on working hours
and child labor . These efforts somewhat counter-balanced the effects of a surplus workforce by introducing
collective bargaining – essentially, workers banding together to create a kind of artificial scarcity of labor
(through strikes or closed-shop agreements) so that employers could not simply replace one worker with
the next man off the street. Early successes were limited (unions were often repressed or illegal until mid-
century), but gradually the tide turned. By the 1870s and 1880s, real wages in Britain were rising more
noticeably , and labor laws had improved conditions modestly.
It’s telling, however , that this turning point coincided with a time when the labor supply pressure eased .
Historian Robert Allen and others argue that from about 1850 onward, Britain’s demographic transition
(declining birth rates) and its massive export of people (to colonies like Canada, Australia, and the U.S.)
reduced the labor glut at home, allowing wages to increase as industrial productivity continued growing. In
essence, the reserve army shrank , and workers could press for a larger share of the economic pie without
being undercut as easily. Moreover , new technologies eventually demanded more skilled labor , giving some
workers leverage due to skills scarcity rather than sheer numbers. The later 19th century saw the fruition of
this in what some call the “horse race” between technology and education – but that goes beyond our
scope. The key point remains: where workers remained plentiful and unorganized , as in many colonial or
peripheral regions feeding raw materials to industry, wages stayed extremely low (for example, Indian
textile workers in 1900 earned a tiny fraction of what British textile workers did, as India had a vast labor
pool and weak bargaining institutions).
In the United States, the Industrial Revolution took hold after the Civil War , and waves of immigrants from
Europe and Asia created a huge labor pool for the burgeoning factories and railroads. During the Gilded
Age (1870s–1900) , American industrialists similarly benefited from an oversupply of labor , often pitting
immigrant groups against each other to keep wages down. A miner in Pennsylvania in 1880, say a recent
Polish or Italian immigrant, would find thousands of others vying for the same back-breaking jobs – and
mine owners ruthlessly exploited this, hiring strikebreakers and using ethnic tensions to prevent a unified41
4422

labor front. One result was violent clashes like the  Homestead Strike (1892)  and the  Ludlow Massacre
(1914) , where labor’s attempts to gain power met armed resistance. Union leaders like Eugene V. Debs
pointed out that as long as capital could draw on a vast “army” of the unemployed or desperate, any single
group of workers was in a weak position. This contributed to the push for national labor reforms and
tighter immigration restrictions (indeed, by the 1920s, the U.S. imposed immigration quotas partly to stem
the labor supply and protect wages).
By the early 20th century, then, in the industrialized world there was at least recognition that uncontrolled
labor gluts led to social instability  – hence reforms from  Bismarck’s social insurance in Germany  to
Roosevelt’s New Deal in the U.S.  sought to soften the edges. But before exploring the 20th century
further , we must examine one of the most dramatic labor market shocks in history, one that tested societies’
capacity to handle an extreme oversupply of workers: the Great Depression of the 1930s .
The Great Depression: Labor Glut and the Loss of Worker Power
(1930s)
When the global economy collapsed in 1929, it was as if the trapdoor opened beneath tens of millions of
workers  worldwide.  Factories  shuttered,  banks  failed,  farms  went  bankrupt.  By  1932,  unemployment
reached astounding levels: 25% in the United States , nearly 30% in Germany , and even higher in some
hard-hit countries like Poland (where it rose above 40%) . This sudden, massive labor glut  – so many
people desperate for any job at any wage – had a predictably dire impact on those workers’ bargaining
power and living standards. With four, five, or ten jobless men for every opening , employers (those that
survived the downturn) found themselves in an overwhelmingly advantageous position to dictate terms.
Wages  tumbled,  working  hours  were  cut  or  made  “flexible”  to  the  employer’s  whim,  and  job  security
vanished. The Great Depression thus stands as a stark example of how an oversupply of labor (through
mass unemployment) can systematically undermine wages and worker rights .
Wage Cuts and “Any Job at Any Pay”
At the onset of the Depression, some policymakers clung to the hope that keeping wages stable would prop
up purchasing power . But as the crisis deepened, wage cuts became widespread and often severe. In the
United States, nominal wages in many industries fell by over 20% between 1929 and 1933, as companies
slashed pay to reduce costs amid plummeting prices. Deflation actually made some  real wages appear
stable for a time, but in truth most workers had less money in their pockets – or no job at all. In  Great
Britain , detailed data show that the early 1930s brought “masses of wage cuts.” Between 1930 and 1932,
the average frequency of pay cuts spiked dramatically . In 1931 alone, more than one-third of British
workers saw their wages reduced . One economic analysis notes that in 1931, 36.3%  of U.K. employees
got a pay cut, while a vanishingly small  0.4%  received a raise . Those numbers paint a bleak picture:
essentially no workers had the leverage to secure raises, while one in three had to accept lower pay. In the
United  States ,  the  situation  was  similar .  Even  though  President  Herbert  Hoover  initially  implored
businesses not to cut wages, by 1931–1932 reality prevailed: wages were cut or work hours reduced across
the board to avoid outright layoffs (or in addition to layoffs).
For those out of work, the struggle was even more acute. Lines of unemployed workers – the iconic
“breadlines” and queues at soup kitchens – became everyday sights in cities like New York, Chicago, London,
and Berlin. A New York City man in a breadline in 1932 might have been an office clerk a year before; now4546

he would take any manual labor for a meal. John Steinbeck’s novel The Grapes of Wrath  memorably depicts
how oversupply of labor drove down wages: when masses of Dust Bowl migrants reached California, they
found “the state oversupplied with labor; wages are low, and workers are exploited to the point of
starvation.”  Steinbeck describes contractors spreading false rumors of plentiful jobs to attract far more
workers than needed, so that they could pay as little as 5 cents an hour for picking fruit – knowing
desperate families would accept. In one scene, farm owners cut the offered rate in half because so many
hungry people camp outside the gates willing to work. “How can you frighten a man whose hunger is in the
wretched  bellies  of  his  children?”  Steinbeck  writes  –  such  a  man  will  work  for  any  pittance .  This
fictionalized account was grounded in real occurrences during the Depression: for example, the cotton
harvest wage in California fell from $1.50 per hundred pounds picked to 40 cents  as thousands of migrants
flooded  the  fields .  This  is  a  textbook  case  of  labor  glut  killing  bargaining  power  –  there  was  no
bargaining, only take it or leave it, and too many had to take it.
Collapsed Unions and Worker Rights
The early 1930s were a dark time for labor rights. In much of the world, union membership plummeted
along with employment. Organizing a strike was nearly impossible when so many unemployed were ready
to replace strikers. Employers and authorities often took a hard line, fearing both communist influence and
the need to cut costs to survive the economy. In the United States, unionization actually picked up later in the
1930s  (after 1935, thanks to the New Deal’s pro-labor reforms), but in the worst years of 1930–1933, unions
struggled. A notable event was the  Ford Hunger March  of 1932 in Detroit, where thousands of jobless
autoworkers  protested  for  relief  and  some  were  shot  by  police  –  a  brutal  reminder  that  economic
desperation could lead to violent confrontation, with little immediate gain for labor .
In countries like Germany, the Depression’s labor glut had profound political effects. With unemployment at
6 million (about 30%) in 1932, German workers were extremely vulnerable. Wages fell, and the Weimar
government’s  emergency  decrees  cut  welfare  and  pay  in  a  deflationary  spiral.  This  mass  desperation
eroded support for moderate politics and helped fuel the rise of extremist solutions – including the Nazi
Party, which promised jobs (through public works and rearmament) and crushed independent unions once
in power . In the U.K., high joblessness and wage cuts led to the fall of the Labour government in 1931 and
formation of a National Government that, among other things, actually  cut unemployment benefits (a
controversial move that prompted riots in some towns). In one grim incident, a Welsh miner commented
that the means test for dole relief was so degrading that it “made you wish you were back underground; at
least down the mine we had a wage – now we have nothing.” Countless personal stories from the era echo
that sentiment of lost dignity and power .
Poland’s experience during the Depression offers an extreme quantification of the pain: By 1933, nominal
wages in Poland had fallen by over 50% compared to 1928 . Even though prices also fell, the drop
in wages was catastrophic for living standards. Discontent led to strikes and even uprisings – in 1932,
starving workers in the Lesko county of Poland rose up, only to be violently suppressed . Here we see
that even moderate labor gluts can degrade conditions, but massive ones can spark social upheaval .
The Polish government, much like others, eventually turned to public works and later military spending to
absorb unemployment, implicitly acknowledging that leaving such a surplus labor condition unchecked was
untenable.
It  wasn’t  just  industrial  workers  affected.  Professional  and  white-collar  workers  also  faced
underemployment and pay cuts, though their plight gets less attention. Schoolteachers, civil servants, and48

others often took significant salary reductions as tax revenues plunged. For instance, in the U.S., President
Hoover in 1932 signed the Economy Act which slashed federal salaries and veteran pensions by about 15%
. In effect, the Depression pushed not just the working poor but also segments of the middle class into
a weaker economic position, many losing their jobs and joining the labor surplus.
Government Intervention: A New Role in the Labor Market
The utter collapse of worker bargaining power in the early Depression forced a rethinking of economic
policy.  In  the  United  States,  Franklin  D.  Roosevelt’s  administration,  coming  to  power  in  1933,  took
unprecedented steps to boost workers’ position – not out of pure altruism, but as a means of economic
recovery.  The  National  Recovery  Administration  (NRA)  encouraged  industries  to  set  fair  wages  and
allowed collective bargaining (though the NRA was later struck down by the Supreme Court) . The
Wagner Act of 1935 firmly established workers’ right to unionize, leading to a surge in union membership
late in the decade. These measures aimed to remove some of the labor oversupply pressure by empowering
workers to negotiate as a group and by shortening workweeks (so more jobs could be spread around).
Likewise, large public works programs (like the WPA in the U.S.) directly hired millions, taking them out of
the desperate labor pool and thus indirectly shoring up wage standards (a form of Keynesian strategy to
reduce the glut). 
In Europe, various strategies were used. Britain instituted a modest unemployment insurance earlier (since
1911) which was expanded, though benefits were kept low. Germany under Hitler pursued autarky and
rearmament, which by 1936 had essentially eliminated unemployment (through massive state employment
and conscription), albeit at the cost of militarizing society. The Soviet Union, meanwhile, had its own labor
issues but claimed to have no unemployment – an artifact of state control rather than a balanced labor
market.  In  any  case,  the  Depression  taught  governments  that  extreme  labor  surplus  –  mass
unemployment – was not just an individual tragedy but a collective economic and political disaster .
This lesson shaped policy for decades to come, as maintaining a high level of employment became a key
goal (enshrined, for example, in Britain’s 1944 White Paper on Employment Policy).
By the late 1930s, as the world economy gradually clawed back or shifted into wartime production, the
labor glut of the Depression receded. World War II, grim as it was, effectively solved unemployment in the
U.S. and elsewhere by drafting soldiers and ramping up factory work (suddenly labor scarcity reappeared
– e.g., American factories in 1943 had to recruit women en masse, “Rosie the Riveter ,” because so many men
were at war , and wages for many workers rose during the war due to overtime and demand). It is a telling
contrast: from the early 1930s, when a man might beg for a day’s work at any wage, to the early 1940s,
when  defense  plants  were  complaining  of  worker  shortages  and  offering  training  and  decent  pay  to
whoever would join. The pendulum had swung from glut to scarcity under the extraordinary circumstance
of total war .
The Great Depression experience reinforced the core thesis: when labor is abundant and jobs are scarce,
wages and conditions fall unless something steps in to change that dynamic . In the Depression, that
“something” was partly government policy and partly external events (war). But absent those, the market
alone was driving a race to the bottom for workers, as illustrated by cases like the California migrant
farmworkers or the Polish labor riots. Economists later quantified this relationship as the “wage curve” or
Phillips  curve  trade-off  –  high  unemployment  correlating  with  lower  wage  growth.  One  analysis  of
post-2008  data  by  the  IMF,  for  instance,  notes  that  recovering  labor  markets  see  wages  lag  until
unemployment gets low enough . Indeed, a study by the Economic Policy Institute found that excessive53
54
55
11
unemployment  in  the  aftermath  of  the  Great  Recession  (and  in  most  years  since  1979)  has
“suppressed wage growth” for typical workers . In other words, the Depression was an extreme case,
but even moderate upticks in unemployment can have measurable negative effects on wages. We turn next
to the late 20th century, where we see this principle play out in a more gradual but profound way through
globalization .
Globalization’s New Reserve Army: Late 20th Century Labor and the
“Great Doubling”
In the latter decades of the 20th century, the world’s labor markets underwent a transformation arguably as
significant as that of the Industrial Revolution. Barriers between national economies came down; hundreds
of millions of new workers from populous countries entered the global workforce. Factories could now be
moved across oceans to tap cheaper labor , and competition for jobs was no longer local or even national,
but  global . Economists have called this the  “Great Doubling”  – the effective doubling of the available
global labor force due to the integration of China, India, the former Soviet bloc, and other developing
regions into the world economy . This enormous increase in labor supply on a world scale had far-
reaching effects on wages and worker power , especially for less-skilled workers in developed countries and
industrial workers in developing ones. Broadly, globalization from the 1980s onward tended to undermine
worker bargaining power in high-wage countries (through outsourcing and import competition)  and
keep wages low in low-wage countries (through an abundance of rural migrants and eager job-seekers
willing to work for little). It was a new form of labor glut – not localized in one place, but distributed via
global supply chains and capital mobility.
The Great Doubling and Its Discontents
Harvard economist Richard Freeman famously observed that with the opening of China and India and the
collapse of Soviet communism by the 1990s, the world’s market labor force effectively doubled from about
1.5 billion to 3 billion workers . He wrote that this “Great Doubling”  posed a challenge: there were now far
more workers relative to capital, tilting bargaining power away from labor on a global scale . One
analysis put it starkly:  “the supply of labor available to capital doubled in two decades (Freeman 2006)... This
situation brought a considerable excess of labor supply, which deteriorated wage structures and increased job
insecurity worldwide.” . In other words, companies suddenly had a much larger pool of labor to choose
from,  which  exerted  downward  pressure  on  wages  and  made  employment  more  precarious  nearly
everywhere.
In industrialized Western countries, this era saw  manufacturing jobs migrate  to lower-wage nations. A
steelworker in Pittsburgh or a textile operator in Manchester who once had strong union wages found their
factory shutting down and reopening in China or Mexico where wages were a fraction of the cost. The
threat of offshoring became a powerful cudgel in negotiations: employers could credibly say, “Accept lower
pay or we’ll move production abroad.” This wasn’t an idle threat. For example, from 1979 to 2010, the U.S.
lost  some  8  million  manufacturing  jobs;  not  all  due  to  trade,  but  trade  and  offshoring  were  major
contributors . Studies by the Economic Policy Institute estimated that competition with imports from
low-wage  countries  (especially  after  China  joined  the  WTO  in  2001)  not  only  eliminated  jobs  but  also
suppressed wage growth for non-college educated workers in the U.S. . Indeed, EPI noted that global
integration  with  low-wage  countries  has  “adversely  affected  wages”  of  workers  without  college
degrees in America . This was essentially the labor glut principle writ large: American workers now3

effectively had to compete with an enormous surplus of labor in countries where workers earned perhaps
one-tenth the wage. The result was often either wage stagnation, job loss, or the erosion of benefits and
conditions to cut costs.
One emblematic case was the NAFTA  agreement in 1994, which integrated the U.S., Canadian, and Mexican
markets. While it brought some investment to Mexico and cheaper goods to the U.S., it also exemplified
pressures on labor . Many U.S. factories moved to Mexico for cheaper labor , weakening manufacturing
unions.  Conversely,  Mexican  farmers  faced  an  influx  of  U.S.  agribusiness  crops,  leading  to  rural
displacement and further swelling Mexico’s pool of low-wage workers (some of whom then migrated to U.S.
illegally, further adding to labor supply there in certain sectors like agriculture and construction – another
nuance: migration itself being a labor supply augmenter). 
In Europe, the fall of the Iron Curtain and expansion of the European Union meant Western European
workers now effectively competed with Eastern Europeans as well. Companies could outsource to Poland or
Slovakia, or hire cheaper migrant workers. This increased labor supply within the integrated EU market kept
a lid on wages in some industries. For instance, German manufacturing underwent reforms in the 2000s
(the Hartz reforms) that created a large low-wage sector; Germany also benefited from offshoring parts of
production  to  Eastern  Europe,  containing  labor  costs.  By  the  late  1990s  and  2000s,  even  though
unemployment in advanced countries sometimes fell (like the U.S. in late 90s had low unemployment),
workers’ bargaining power remained historically weaker, reflected in the declining share of national
income going to labor  in many countries . Global competition was a key reason. As one report noted,
“the  falling  labor  share  of  GDP  and  stagnant  real  wages  since  the  late  1990s”  can  be  linked  to  these
globalization dynamics .
Effects on Developing World Workers
One might ask: what about the workers in the low-wage countries themselves? Did they gain or suffer from
this glut? The answer is mixed. Countries like China experienced an economic boom that did lift hundreds of
millions out of extreme poverty. Real wages in coastal Chinese factories did eventually rise, especially by the
2010s, due to growth and some shortages of young labor . However , in the earlier period of the 1980s–
2000s, these gains were limited and hard-won. China in the 1990s  had an enormous “floating population”
of rural migrants streaming into cities to work in factories for very low pay (young women stitching apparel
in Shenzhen or assembling electronics in Dongguan for , say, 12 hours a day, six days a week, at wages that
barely covered dormitory housing and food). This huge internal reserve of labor – hundreds of millions of
underemployed peasants – meant that even as China’s export industries expanded, the labor supply kept
coming, holding wages down initially. It was only after perhaps 15–20 years of rapid growth that China
began to near what economists call the “Lewis turning point,” where surplus rural labor is absorbed and
wages start rising more sharply. But throughout the 90s and 2000s, Western companies sourcing from
China benefited from that  vast surplus of labor . The workers, for their part, often lacked independent
unions (unions were state-controlled in China) and so had little bargaining power beyond occasional wildcat
strikes. Conditions in many factories were harsh (famously, the Foxconn electronics plants had a series of
worker suicides in 2010 that drew attention to repetitive stress and pressure-cooker environments).
In other developing nations like  Bangladesh  or  Indonesia , a similar story: global garment brands could
contract production to factories where armies of young women earned meager wages, often in unsafe
conditions, because labor was abundant and job alternatives few. The deadly Rana Plaza factory collapse in
Bangladesh in 2013 – killing over 1,100 workers – underscored how cheap and interchangeable labor had59
60
13
become in the global garment supply chain. Workers who raised concerns could be easily replaced, and
safety was neglected in the push for low-cost production. It’s a grim parallel to earlier eras: just as 19th-
century British mill owners had a queue of rural children to hire, 21st-century apparel contractors in Dhaka
had a queue of rural migrants at their gates, willing to accept $2 a day. 
One could argue that globalization did create new jobs in poor countries (which is true), but it often kept
those jobs’ wages very low due to the sheer number of people willing to work . The result was a transfer
of some manufacturing from high-wage regions to low-wage ones – benefiting some workers in poor
countries with employment, but also transmitting the downward pressure on wages globally . Indeed,
the presence of this global labor surplus allowed multinational corporations to play workers in different
countries off against each other , much like 19th-century mill owners played local ethnic groups against each
other . For example, if a Taiwanese factory got “too expensive,” a brand could move orders to Vietnam; if
Vietnam’s wages rose, next stop Ethiopia, and so forth – a global “race to the bottom” in labor costs. 
In the late 20th century, unions and labor laws struggled to catch up to this new reality. In the U.S. and U.K.,
union density fell precipitously in the face of deindustrialization and hostile political climates (Reagan and
Thatcher’s  eras).  One  result:  a  weaker  ability  for  workers  to  negotiate  wage  increases  even  when
unemployment  was  moderate.  The  1990s  in  America,  for  instance,  saw  decent  economic  growth  and
relatively low unemployment by decade’s end, but median wages stagnated  for much of the decade .
Many attributed this to global pressures – companies could outsource, or threaten to, which kept workers
cautious. Additionally, the rise of temporary and contract work (the “precariat”)  in advanced economies
in the 1990s and 2000s meant that even if headline unemployment was low, many workers felt insecure and
had reduced bargaining power . Labor economist Guy Standing called this emerging class the “precariat,”
noting how globalization and deregulation created a large group of workers with precarious jobs, no union
protection, and thus little leverage to demand better pay or stable schedules.
Moderate Gluts, Big Effects
It’s worth highlighting that the labor oversupply in the globalization era was often not a visible mass
unemployment in rich countries – it was more subtle. In the U.S., the unemployment rate in the mid-1990s
was around 5% (not high), and in the mid-2000s before the financial crisis it hovered around 4-5%. On paper ,
that’s near “full employment.” Yet wages for average workers barely rose , and inequality widened. How
could  that  be,  if  not  many  were  unemployed?  The  answer  lies  in  the  broader  effective  labor  supply .
Globalization meant that even a fully employed domestic workforce was competing (indirectly) with a much
larger pool abroad, and within the country the decline of unions and fear of jobs moving kept a lid on wage
demands. In technical terms, the Phillips curve (which inversely relates unemployment to wage inflation)
appeared to flatten – low unemployment didn’t translate into high wage growth as strongly as before .
The  IMF  in  2018  noted  a  “disconnect  between  unemployment  and  wages” ,  partly  attributing  it  to
globalization  and  automation  making  workers  feel  replaceable .  This  shows  that  even  a  moderate
perceived labor glut or threat  can have significant detrimental effects on labor conditions – you don’t
need 25% unemployment as in the 1930s; even an environment of job insecurity and competition from
outside can achieve a similar dampening of worker power .
By the late 2000s, an interesting reversal started in some emerging markets: China, for instance, began
experiencing labor shortages in certain coastal areas and wages started rising around 15-20% annually for
factory workers in the early 2010s. This led some companies to move to inland China or to countries like
Vietnam – again chasing the surplus. In essence, whenever scarcity arose in one place, capital sought out a3
55
55
14
new labor surplus elsewhere. This global agility of capital is a defining feature of late 20th and early 21st
century economics, and it tends to keep the overall bargaining power of workers in check  on a worldwide
scale. 
As we move to the next section on the post-2008 Great Recession  and the current century’s technological
upheavals, keep in mind how this globalization-driven glut set the stage. The workforce in developed
countries was already on the back foot entering 2008 – years of offshoring and outsourcing had eroded
what  was  once  strong  organized  labor  in  many  sectors.  Then  came  another  cataclysmic  shock  –  the
financial crisis – which created a new surge of unemployment. And just as economies recovered from that, a
new specter appeared: automation and artificial intelligence, threatening to displace workers and create a
different kind of labor surplus: humans replaced by machines . 
Bust Again: The Great Recession (2008–2009) and Its Aftermath
When  the  global  financial  system  teetered  in  2008,  millions  of  workers  once  more  faced  sudden
unemployment. The  Great Recession  that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008
was the worst downturn since the 1930s. While its duration was shorter , its impact on labor was harsh. In
the United States, over 8.7 million jobs vanished between 2008 and 2010; the unemployment rate spiked to
10% (in late 2009) . In parts of Europe, it was even worse – Spain’s unemployment exceeded 20%,
Greece’s over 25%. Even countries less directly hit by the financial crash felt the slowdown. This swift
creation of a labor glut  – many more workers than jobs – once again put downward pressure on wages and
working conditions. What distinguished the Great Recession’s aftermath was how long some of its labor
effects lingered, even as headline unemployment rates eventually fell. The post-2008 recovery was often
dubbed a “jobless recovery” initially, and then a “wageless recovery,” meaning jobs came back slowly and
wages even more slowly. This highlighted how even moderate, persistent labor slack  can hold back wage
gains for years.
Unemployment and Wage Stagnation in the 2010s
By 2010, economists and policymakers noticed a troubling trend: despite efforts like stimulus spending and
near-zero interest rates, employment was improving at a crawl and wages were barely rising. In the U.S.,
the unemployment rate remained above 8% for over three years (2009 through 2012). Historically, such
elevated joblessness would correspond to stagnant or falling wages – and indeed, wage growth was very
sluggish.  A  report  by  the  Economic  Policy  Institute  pointed  out  that  chronic  high  unemployment
post-2008 “suppressed wage growth” especially for low- and middle-wage workers . They emphasized
that this was not only during the recession itself but “over most years since 1979”  – essentially arguing that
except  for  late-1990s,  the  U.S.  had  frequently  maintained  enough  of  a  labor  surplus  (with  either
unemployment or underemployment or global labor competition) to keep wages down for the majority .
In the 2010–2013 period, as unemployment slowly ebbed, businesses were often able to hire without
offering big pay raises because plenty of job seekers were available. As Federal Reserve officials noted,
there seemed to be more “slack” in the labor market than the unemployment number alone indicated
(many  discouraged  workers  had  left  the  labor  force,  for  example,  and  could  come  back  if  conditions
improved, thus acting as an extra reserve labor pool).
Europe faced a two-speed situation: Germany and some northern countries recovered employment faster
(Germany  even  had  a  short-time  work  scheme  that  prevented  mass  layoffs),  whereas  Mediterranean
countries saw depression-level unemployment for many years. In  Greece , by 2013 unemployment was61
3
3
15
~27%, and wages were cut sharply as part of austerity measures. In  Spain , unemployment over 20%
persisted into 2015, and a whole generation of young Spaniards struggled to find stable jobs. The EU’s
lesser-developed members (Eastern Europe) actually experienced some emigration of their workers to find
jobs elsewhere, ironically easing their local labor supply pressure by exporting it.
In the U.S., one outcome of the slack labor market was the rise of the gig economy . Companies like Uber ,
TaskRabbit, and others emerged around 2009–2013, offering people side gigs or freelance work. Part of
why these platforms could grow was the abundance of people needing extra income or unable to find
traditional jobs. Uber famously classified its drivers as independent contractors, meaning they had no labor
protections or benefits. The implicit promise was flexibility, but the reality for many was long hours for
relatively low pay, with the constant churn of new drivers signing up – an oversupply keeping earnings for
gig  workers  in  check.  An  article  on  the  gig  economy  noted  that  if,  say,  driving  for  Uber  became  too
remunerative, it would attract more drivers and thereby lower the average driver’s share of riders (and
income). In effect,  the gig platforms dynamically adjust to labor surplus : more workers join, the pie
doesn’t grow as fast, so each gets a smaller slice. 
By the mid-2010s, as unemployment finally fell to low levels (the U.S. reached ~5% by 2015 and under 4% by
2018), wages did start to pick up modestly. However , the gains mostly went to higher-skilled workers; low-
wage workers saw very limited improvement , partly because they had been hit hardest and had the least
bargaining power . Moreover , the scars of the recession (like long-term unemployed people who never
returned to the workforce, or accepted lower-paying jobs than before) meant a lot of  hidden  slack. A
Brookings Institution analysis in 2016 pointed out that even though the headline unemployment was down,
one in eleven American workers was either unemployed, underemployed, or discouraged (not actively
looking but wanting a job) . They also noted many of those who found new jobs were re-employed at
lower wages  than their pre-recession jobs . This suggests a lingering effect: once a labor glut drove
wages down or job quality down, some of that was “locked in” even after the glut abated, as workers had
lost their previous footholds. 
The Great Recession  also accelerated a trend toward more contingent and part-time work . Employers,
having learned to “do more with less” during the lean years, were cautious about hiring back full-time staff.
Instead, many expanded part-time roles or contract positions. Involuntary part-time employment (people
who want full-time but can only get part-time) spiked during the recession and remained elevated for years
after . This underemployment is another form of labor oversupply – people have more hours they  could
work, but the jobs don’t provide them. It too keeps a lid on wage pressures.
Policy Responses and Missed Opportunities
In some sense, the policy response to the Great Recession was the inverse of the 1930s. Governments and
central  banks  intervened  very  aggressively  to  stabilize  the  banking  system  and  stimulate  economies
(through  spending  and  ultra-low  interest  rates).  These  measures  likely  prevented  an  even  worse
unemployment catastrophe. However , in terms of direct labor empowerment, the post-2008 period saw
fewer dramatic pro-labor reforms than the New Deal had provided in the 1930s. There was no new Wagner
Act or nationwide mobilization of unions (union density in the U.S. actually continued to decline). One
exception might be the rise of minimum wage campaigns in the 2010s – for instance, the “Fight for $15”
movement in the U.S. successfully pushed several cities and states to commit to $15/hour minimum wages
by the late 2010s. This was a response to the reality that low-end wages had stagnated for decades (federal
minimum wage in the U.S. stayed at $7.25 from 2009 onward, losing purchasing power each year). Studies6263
64
16
show that raising the minimum wage in a tight labor market can lift incomes with minimal job loss. But in a
slack labor market, minimum wage hikes are harder to push politically (fear of job loss looms larger when
unemployment is high).
Some economists argued that policymakers allowed the labor glut to persist too long after 2008. The U.S.
Congress, for example, ended extended unemployment benefits early (in 2014) and pursued austerity in
budgets around 2011–2013, which possibly slowed job growth. In Europe, austerity measures in many
countries kept unemployment painfully high for longer than necessary, critics say. If governments had
instead aimed for faster full employment, workers might have regained bargaining power sooner . This
debate underscores a modern understanding: policy can influence how long a labor glut lasts and thus
how much workers suffer . Those years of weak labor markets in early 2010s were arguably a policy choice
to some degree. 
By the time the world economy reached late 2019, in many places unemployment was at multi-decade lows
(the U.S. hit 3.5% unemployment, Germany ~3%, U.K. ~4%). One might have expected a triumphant return
of labor’s bargaining power . There was some improvement: U.S. wage growth ticked up to around 3%
annually (still modest by historical standards). But crucially, even at these low unemployment rates, worker
bargaining power did not fully recover to pre-globalization or mid-century levels . A 2021 IMF report
was tellingly titled “The Disconnect Between Unemployment and Wages” , noting that in many advanced
economies wage growth remained weaker than expected given low jobless rates. The reasons cited include
globalization (as discussed) and also technology  – automation substituting for workers, and digitalization
enabling new forms of gig work – which is the next and ongoing story.
The 21st Century Technological Squeeze: Automation and the New
“Surplus” of Labor
As we venture into the current era, a new specter looms over workers: the prospect that machines – robots,
algorithms, artificial intelligence – could render many of them redundant, creating a kind of technological
unemployment  on a large scale. The idea isn’t new (the Luddites feared it in 1811, John Maynard Keynes
warned of it in 1930), but recent advances in artificial intelligence and automation have given it fresh
urgency. While optimistic economists argue new jobs will emerge as old ones vanish, there is evidence that
the last few decades of automation have already contributed to wage inequality and job polarization.
Essentially, technology can act as a force multiplier of labor glut: if one machine can do the work of five
people, then unless new tasks appear , we have four people “surplus” to requirements. And if those people
then compete for the remaining jobs, down go the wages.
Automation’s Impact on Wages and Inequality
A comprehensive study published in 2022 by MIT economists Acemoglu and Restrepo quantified how much
automation (particularly in manufacturing) has affected U.S. wages since 1980. Their findings were striking:
they estimate that automation reduced wages significantly for less-educated workers, accounting for
most of the growth in the wage gap over that period . Specifically, since 1980, automation (from
robotics, software, etc.) cut the wages of men without a high school diploma by about 8.8%, and women
with similar education by 2.3% . One of the authors remarked that automation is “a labor-shifting device,
rather than a productivity-increasing device,”  meaning companies used it chiefly to replace workers and cut
costs,  not  necessarily  to  greatly  increase  output  per  se .  The  consequence  was  an  oversupply  of65
66
66

17
displaced workers relative to the jobs still needing humans, which  pushed their wages down . This
research supports the view that technology has been a key driver in undermining worker bargaining power
over the last few decades – not by causing mass unemployment (employment did recover) but by changing
the mix of jobs and giving employers alternatives to human labor .
Consider a simple example: in an auto factory in 1970, 10,000 union workers might have built cars. By 2010,
the same factory might produce more cars with 2,000 workers and hundreds of industrial robots. The 8,000
displaced workers have to find other work – perhaps in retail, services, or not at all if they retire early or
drop out. The new jobs they find likely pay less (since manufacturing used to be higher-paid blue-collar
work). And importantly, the presence of automation weakens those who remain in manufacturing: the
union cannot easily demand big raises if management can point to the possibility of further automation or
outsourcing. This indeed happened: auto manufacturing wages stagnated or even fell in real terms in the
U.S., especially after the 2000s (new hires at U.S. car plants post-recession often started at half the wage of
senior workers, a result of the union concessions in 2009). Part of the reason was globalization (foreign non-
union plants in U.S. South undercutting Detroit’s union shops), but part was that technology had altered the
labor-capital balance – fewer humans were absolutely necessary.
Another visible area is retail and fast food. Self-checkout kiosks  in grocery stores and ordering tablets  in
restaurants are becoming common. Each such machine potentially replaces a cashier or order-taker . For
now, these sectors still employ millions (there is usually one attendant for many self-checkout lanes, for
instance), but the direction is clear . If a restaurant chain faced a push to raise wages to, say, $20/hour , they
might accelerate the deployment of automated systems to avoid hiring more staff – an implicit check on
how far wages can rise. The pandemic of 2020–2021 actually hastened some automation as well (e.g., some
establishments moved to QR code menus and online ordering to reduce staff interactions). The  fear of
technology displacing jobs  can itself act as a brake on worker demands: one cannot bargain with an
algorithm, after all.
On the flip side, technology also created new gig-like opportunities (Uber , Lyft, food delivery apps) as
mentioned, but those often lack protections and stable income. There’s an eerie parallel to the 19th-century
“putting out system” or piece-work: modern gig workers are paid per task (per ride, per delivery), a model
that keeps them in competition with one another and with the platform’s ever-adjusting algorithms.
Early 21st Century: Whose Scarcity?
One  interesting  wrinkle  in  the  late  2010s  was  that  even  as  many  workers  felt  the  squeeze,  certain
specialized skills did become scarce and commanded high wages. Software developers, data scientists, and
other tech professionals saw booming demand and could often name their price. This highlighted a divide:
for high-skill labor, scarcity prevailed (driving wages up), while for lower-skill labor, surplus prevailed
(holding wages down) . This divergence contributed to inequality. For instance, a top AI engineer in Silicon
Valley might earn a six-figure or even million-dollar salary due to a shortage of people with cutting-edge
machine learning skills. Meanwhile, a warehouse worker at an Amazon fulfillment center might find their
real wage barely above the minimum, because there are many people who can do that work and Amazon is
investing in robots to do it too.
In some advanced economies like Japan and parts of Western Europe, demographics introduced another
factor: aging populations and low birth rates led to genuine labor shortages in certain sectors (e.g., elder
care,  construction).  Japan,  faced  with  a  shrinking  workforce,  turned  heavily  to  automation  (robots  for66
18
caregiving, AI, etc.) to compensate – a different way of tackling scarcity that ironically prevented wages in
those fields from rising too much (if a care robot can do some tasks, the human caregiver’s wage doesn’t
skyrocket due to scarcity of staff; instead, fewer staff are needed). In countries like Germany, shortages of
skilled tradespeople have led to wage increases and efforts to attract immigrants. But the global pool of
labor (including migrants) often fills gaps before wage surges can occur . For example, Poland’s outflow of
workers to Western Europe created a shortage at home, but Poland then brought in hundreds of thousands
of workers from Ukraine and elsewhere to plug the gap – thus mitigating local wage pressures. 
This fluidity shows how in a globalized world with technology, true labor scarcity is localized and often
temporary , whereas surplus (in at least some categories of labor) remains more persistent. It took a shock
as huge as the 2020 pandemic to create a brief broader labor scarcity in places like the U.S. – after initial
layoffs, by 2021 many employers struggled to rehire, and wages for service jobs jumped as they competed
for  workers.  Some  dubbed  it  the  “Great  Resignation”  period,  with  workers  quitting  at  high  rates  and
demanding better conditions. But even that may prove fleeting; as of 2022–2023, with interest rates rising
and the economy cooling, the leverage might shift back again. History teaches that unless reinforced by
strong institutions (unions, labor-friendly laws), worker gains during scarcity moments can be eroded when
conditions swing back to surplus.
The Future: AI and the Unknown
As we stand today, the development of advanced AI (like language models, self-driving technology, etc.)
raises the question: will this time be different? Will large segments of workers – not just in manual jobs but
white-collar roles – be displaced, creating an unprecedented labor glut? Or will new industries and roles
emerge to absorb them? If history is a guide, even the threat of such displacement can weaken worker
power . A software engineer negotiating a salary in 2030 might hear , “We’re also considering an AI solution
to maintain this code, so we can’t justify a higher salary.” True or not, that dampens wage pressure. In
sectors like trucking, if self-driving trucks become viable, the mere anticipation can keep truck drivers’ wage
demands in check – why fight for higher pay if the company might soon replace drivers with autonomous
vehicles? This scenario echoes the reserve army concept but with machines as the reserve.
However ,  some  argue  that  aging  demographics  and  slowing  labor  force  growth  globally  (China,  for
example, now has a declining working-age population) will counterbalance automation – essentially, we’ll
automate because there aren’t enough workers, not to create surplus. That might be true in some macro
sense, but the distributional effect remains: some categories of workers may be very scarce, others very surplus.
The mix matters. Nursing might remain a scarce-skill job (thus higher wages) if robots can’t do it effectively;
whereas routine accounting might become largely automated, making junior accountants surplus.
One should note that technology doesn’t operate in a vacuum – policy will shape its impact. Strong social
safety nets, retraining programs, or even ideas like universal basic income have been proposed to handle a
future where not everyone’s labor is needed. Those policies could mitigate the negative effects of labor
surplus by decoupling income from a job to some extent, thereby giving workers more power to refuse
terrible pay (since starvation is off the table). Whether societies adopt such measures will greatly influence
whether the coming waves of automation lead to  widespread prosperity or a new era of underpaid,
underutilized labor .

Conclusion: The Arc of Labor Supply and Power
From the plague-ravaged fields of medieval Europe to the AI-driven workplaces of the 21st century, the
story is consistent: when workers are scarce relative to the work to be done, they can claim a greater
share of the rewards; when workers are abundant or easily replaced – by other workers, by slaves, by
immigrants,  by  offshoring,  or  by  machines  –  their  leverage  and  conditions  deteriorate.  We  have
traveled through time and around the globe to see this thesis confirmed in era after era. After the Black
Death, English peasants briefly broke the chains of feudalism as labor scarcity made their toil precious
. Centuries later , African slaves and indentured Indians on colonial plantations, forced into  artificial
abundance , toiled in conditions as bad as any in history, deprived of even the chance to bargain . In
smoky  19th-century  factory  towns,  a  glut  of  hands  willing  to  feed  the  machines  kept  wages  at  bare
subsistence even as wealth accumulators prospered . In the depths of the Great Depression, armies
of unemployed stood in line for bread, and those with jobs took pay cuts without a peep, lest they join the
jobless  multitudes .  When  globalization  flung  open  the  doors  between  those  multitudes,  the
effective labor pool exploded, contributing to the long stagnation in pay for working classes in advanced
countries and gruelling low wages in new industrial hubs abroad . And now, as automation and AI
loom, workers wonder if the pendulum will swing further toward surplus, and how they will find footing in a
world where even their skills can be replicated by code.
History also teaches that these outcomes are not simply fate. Human institutions and choices matter . The
post-Black Death peasants had to fight  – in courts, in fields, even in revolt – to secure their higher wages,
and  eventually  many  gains  were  rolled  back .  Conversely,  in  the  late  19th  and  20th  centuries,
workers organized unions and pushed for laws that tempered the effect of labor gluts: antitrust laws to
limit employer monopolies, immigration laws, minimum wages, unemployment insurance, and so on. The
New Deal stands out as a time when policy actively sought to strengthen labor’s hand (through union rights
and public employment) as a way out of depression. In our contemporary period, new ideas such as job
guarantees  or higher minimum wages indexed to productivity  are being debated to ensure that even if
labor is abundant, it is not destitute. 
Yet, it must be acknowledged that the fundamental economic force at play – supply and demand for labor –
remains powerful. Even well-intentioned policies can struggle if they go against a massive labor surplus. For
example, efforts to significantly raise wages in a highly globalized sector might just cause production to
move elsewhere, unless coordinated internationally. This is why some advocate for global labor standards:
to prevent a race to the bottom whereby capital hops between pools of surplus labor .
It is also notable that even moderate labor surpluses have significant effects . We saw that clearly in the
post-2008 recovery: an unemployment rate a few points above normal for a few years was enough to
suppress  wage  growth  for  nearly  a  decade .  We  don’t  need  another  Great  Depression  to  feel  the
consequences – even a mild recession or a slack in a specific industry (like a glut of newly graduated lawyers
in a slow legal market) can lead to salaries stagnating or young professionals taking unpaid internships, etc.
The historical record is essentially a caution to maintain what economists call full employment  – or even
“tight”  labor markets – if the aim is to improve worker wages and conditions. Periods like the immediate
post-World War II decades saw generally low unemployment in the West and coincidentally strong income
gains for the working and middle classes. When unemployment rose in the 1970s and 1980s, those gains
halted or reversed, and labor’s share of income began to fall in many countries. 1

As we conclude this journey, one might reflect on a final dynamic: power and voice . Wages and rights are
not only determined by headcount but by who has voice in the system. Labor scarcity often forces the
powerful to listen to workers – as when medieval lords, however grudgingly, met peasants’ wage demands
or  when  1940s  industrialists  conceded  to  union  terms  because  labor  was  needed  for  the  war  effort.
Conversely, labor surplus often silences workers – who dare not speak up in a sweatshop or a recession for
fear of replacement. Thus, the see-saw of supply is intimately tied to human dignity on the job.
Understanding this history is vital as we navigate our present and future. If technology does create a large
“effective” labor surplus, society will have to decide: do we repeat the patterns of the past – squeezing
workers because we can – or do we use our wealth to ensure a fair distribution even when not everyone’s
labor  is  in  high  demand?  If  another  plague  (or  pandemic)  ironically  bestows  some  scarcity  power  on
essential workers (as we saw briefly during COVID-19 when nurses, delivery drivers, and grocery clerks
gained new leverage), will those gains last or will the old hierarchies reassert themselves ? The thesis of
this report has been that economics tilts strongly in favor of employers when labor is abundant . But
history also shows that through solidarity, policy, and sometimes sheer upheaval, workers have clawed back
power even in unfavorable tides.
In the end, the pendulum of labor supply and demand continues to swing. Knowing its history arms us to
push for a more equitable outcome, so that during times of plenty (of workers) we do not abandon the
principles of fairness, and during times of scarcity we do not forget the value of those whose work truly
makes the world run. The stories of the past – of peasants and artisans, slaves and factory girls, assembly-
line  operators  and  gig  drivers  –  all  echo  a  simple  truth:  treat  workers  as  human  beings,  not  as
interchangeable cogs, and society prospers more justly . When workers have a fair share of bargaining
power ,  economies  tend  to  be  more  stable  and  inclusive;  when  they  are  crushed  by  oversupply  and
indifference, the seeds of discontent and instability are sown. The past has spoken – it is up to us to heed its
lessons for the labor struggles of the present and future.
