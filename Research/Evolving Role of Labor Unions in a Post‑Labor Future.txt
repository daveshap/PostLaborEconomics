Evolving Role of Labor Unions in a Post‑Labor
Future
Industrial robots on an automated food production line. As automation advances in developed economies, labor
unions face the challenge of protecting workers’ interests in an era of dwindling traditional employment.
Introduction and Scope
The accelerating pace of automation – from AI-driven software to physical robotics – is reshaping labor
markets in developed nations. Experts warn of a possible “post-labor” future  in which demand for human
workers shrinks substantially, leading to a surplus of labor , depressed wages, and weakened labor rights.
This report examines how labor unions might adapt and remain relevant under such conditions. It focuses
on the United States, the European Union (with examples from member states), the United Kingdom, and
Japan, across three time horizons:  2025–2035 ,  2035–2050 , and  2050 and beyond . Both the private and
public sectors are considered.
Key questions addressed include: (1) What role will labor unions play if automation significantly reduces the
need for human labor? (2) How can unions help ensure humane, equitable transitions for workers displaced
by technology – for example, via retraining programs, secure pensions, job guarantees, reduced working
hours, or universal basic income (UBI)? (3) How might unions need to evolve structurally or ideologically to
stay relevant – could new models of collective bargaining or solidarity emerge?  (4) What lessons can be
drawn from case studies of union responses to automation so far – what strategies have succeeded, failed,
or shown promise?  (5) Looking ahead, what novel strategies or first-principles innovations might unions
pursue in a future where traditional employment is greatly diminished?
The report draws on academic research, labor organizations’ publications, economic think-tank analyses,
and government data. Tables are included to compare union responses across sectors and regions, as well
as trends in union density and policy approaches. All sources are cited in-text. The goal is a comprehensive,
chronological analysis of union strategies as we move toward a highly automated, “post-labor” society – and
how organized labor can champion workers’ rights and welfare in the face of unprecedented technological
change.
Current Landscape (2025): Automation and Labor Unions
Rising Automation and Its Impact on Labor
By the mid-2020s, automation technologies – including industrial robots, artificial intelligence (AI), and
advanced  software  systems  –  have  become  integral  in  many  industries.  The  “Fourth  Industrial
Revolution”  (encompassing AI, machine learning, IoT, and robotics) is well underway. The World Economic
Forum’s  Future of Jobs 2018  report projected that by the early 2020s nearly  42% of task hours  in the
economy would be performed by machines, with only 58% by humans . While new tech-driven jobs (e.g.
data  science  roles)  are  being  created  –  one  estimate  was  133  million  new  jobs  worldwide  –  many1
1
traditional jobs are being displaced; for example, up to  75 million jobs  (such as postal workers) were
expected to disappear , creating a significant pool of workers needing reemployment . These trends have
only continued, and if anything accelerated, through 2025.
Crucially,  automation  tends  to  increase  productivity  and  can  generate  tremendous  wealth,  but  the
distribution of those gains is uneven. Without intervention, the benefits of automation largely accrue to
business owners and tech producers, while workers face job instability. Numerous studies have found that
automation  exerts downward pressure on wages and labor’s share of income , especially in routine
manual and routine cognitive occupations. For instance, research by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
concluded that automation disproportionately displaces lower-paid workers, worsening income inequality
and  wage polarization . In other words, the lowest-skilled workers – who often have the fewest
resources to adapt – are at the highest risk of job loss and income decline from automation.
By 2025, glimpses of a potential “post-labor” scenario  are visible. Advanced AI systems are beginning to
handle tasks previously thought safe from automation (from customer service chatbots to drafting basic
legal documents). Physical robots are not only on factory floors but also in warehouses, retail (self-checkout
machines), and even transportation (pilot programs for driverless taxis, trucks, and trains). While we are not
yet at a stage of mass structural unemployment, labor markets in developed countries are experiencing
significant churn . Many workers are being forced to transition to new roles or industries as old ones
become redundant. This creates an environment of uncertainty and anxiety among the workforce.
Challenges for Unions in an Automation Era
Labor  unions  –  historically  the  collective  voice  of  workers  –  face  twin  challenges  in  this  environment:
diminishing membership  and diminished leverage . Union power has traditionally rested on organizing a
mass of workers who can collectively withdraw their labor (strike) to demand better conditions. Automation
undercuts both pillars: it reduces the number of workers (hollowing out union membership) and provides
employers alternative means of production that make strikes less threatening (if machines keep running, a
strike is less effective).
Indeed, union density has been on a long-term decline in many developed nations, due to globalization,
shifts  to  service  sectors,  gig  work,  and  decades  of  anti-union  policies  –  and  automation  threatens  to
accelerate that decline. In the United States, only 10.0%  of workers were union members in 2023, an all-
time low, with private-sector unionization at a mere  6% . This is despite a recent uptick in union
activism (e.g. high-profile strikes in 2023 in manufacturing and Hollywood); the overall trend is that union
membership has not kept pace with employment growth, so density fell further in the early 2020s. The UK
tells a similar story: union membership has fallen from over 30% of employees in the 1990s to about 22%  in
2022, the lowest on record . Japan’s unions organized about 17%  of workers as of 2018 , continuing a
steady decline from previous decades. Continental Europe varies by country – some nations like Sweden
and  Denmark  still  boast  high  union  density  (over  60%  in  part  due  to  systems  that  encourage  union
membership), whereas others like France have under 10% of workers unionized. Table 1  summarizes these
trends:

Kingdom22%Down from ~50% in early 1980s; membership now lowest
since records began (1995), with slight recent uptick in
2023.
Japan ~17%Gradual decline from ~25% in late 20th century;
enterprise-based unions struggling to attract younger
and non-traditional workers.
Even as union density declines, public support for labor protection remains significant.  Surveys show workers
are concerned about the impacts of AI/automation and want safeguards . A 2024 European Commission
poll, for example, found  75–80% of Europeans favor new rules  to guide AI in workplaces – including
regulations to involve workers in decisions about new tech, ensure transparency, protect privacy, and
limit automated monitoring of employees . In Ireland, 80% said workers (and their unions) should be
involved in designing/adopting workplace technologies . This indicates that while union membership
numbers are down, the public appetite for collective solutions to tech-driven disruptions is strong .
In summary, as of 2025, labor unions stand at a crossroads:  Automation is beginning to erode the
traditional foundations of union power  (mass worker numbers and the threat of strikes), yet the need  for
worker representation and protection in this disruptive transition may be greater than ever . The following
sections examine how unions are responding and might respond in the future, across our three time
horizons.
2025–2035: Near-Term Union Strategies in the Face of Automation
In the coming decade (mid-2020s through mid-2030s), automation is expected to make deep inroads in
both blue-collar and white-collar jobs. Forecasts by McKinsey and others have suggested that by 2030,
hundreds of millions of jobs worldwide could be displaced by automation – McKinsey researchers projected
up to 800 million global workers  could lose jobs by 2030 in one scenario . Even if many of these
workers  find  new  employment,  the  transitions  will  be  challenging.  During  2025–2035,  we  anticipate
heightened labor market turbulence : sectors like manufacturing, transportation, logistics, retail, and
some services will see significant automation, while new jobs arise in tech, healthcare, and green industries.
Labor  unions  in  developed  countries  will  need  to  navigate  this  turbulence,  aiming  to  protect  existing
workers, help displaced workers, and ensure that technology is implemented in a fair , human-centered  way.
Protecting Workers’ Rights During Technological Change
In the near term, unions are deploying a variety of strategies to  protect workers from the negative
impacts of automation . Rather than opposing technology per se, most unions now seek to manage how45

it’s implemented. A common refrain is that workers should have a  “seat at the table”  whenever new
technologies are introduced on the job. This enables unions to negotiate over safeguards such as training,
redeployment, or compensation. For example:
Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs) with Tech Safeguards:  Unions have started to insert
language into labor contracts addressing automation. A notable case is the Culinary Workers Union
(UNITE HERE Local 226) in Las Vegas, which in 2018 negotiated contract clauses to protect hotel
workers from new tech . The agreement requires employers to give at least 6 months’ advance
notice  if they plan to introduce technology that could lead to layoffs or reduced hours, and to
provide free retraining  for workers to qualify for new jobs created by technology . If automation
(say, new software or machines) creates new roles, affected employees must be given access to
training for those roles at no cost . These provisions don’t stop automation, but they slow its
rollout  and  ensure  workers  aren’t  ambushed  by  sudden  job  losses.  Similarly,  in  the  U.S.
transportation sector , the AFL-CIO’s Transportation Trades Department (TTD) has outlined principles
for bargaining around driverless vehicles, including  advance notice  before autonomous tech is
deployed and a requirement that  human operators remain onboard  for safety even if vehicles
drive  themselves .  Larry  Willis,  then  TTD  President,  emphasized  that  good  jobs  shouldn’t  be
“steamrolled” just so tech companies can cut costs .
Limiting  Surveillance  and  Algorithmic  Management:  With  more  workplaces  using  AI  for
monitoring and managing workers (e.g. tracking productivity or even automating discipline), unions
are  fighting  to  preserve  worker  dignity  and  due  process .  In  Europe,  unions  and  worker
representatives are pushing for an “AI at Work” directive to regulate such practices. As of 2025, 72%
of EU citizens  support rules limiting automated employee monitoring , and 75%+ support rules
for transparency  in algorithmic HR decisions . The European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC)
has advocated a  “human in control” principle  for workplace AI, demanding that AI be used to
assist rather than arbitrarily boss workers . Unions also highlight examples of abuse: for instance,
Amazon’s warehouse management system that automatically tracks “time off task” and can generate
firing decisions without a human supervisor . Marc Perrone, President of the United Food and
Commercial Workers (UFCW), called it “surreal” that a company could fire workers with no human
involvement .  Unions  argue  that  collective  bargaining  can  curtail  such  practices ,  by
negotiating checks on algorithmic management or at least requiring human review in disciplinary
actions .
Ensuring Fair Share of Productivity Gains:  Where automation boosts productivity, unions in the
2025–2035 period will fight to ensure workers benefit through higher wages or other compensation,
rather than all gains accruing to shareholders. This connects to broader campaigns like the “Fight
for $15”  minimum wage movement. Organizers see raising baseline wages as essential in an age
where  automation  often  increases  profits  even  as  it  reduces  labor’s  bargaining  power .
Unions as a collective force are better positioned to demand that  efficiency gains are shared  –
whether  through  wage  increases,  bonuses,  or  profit-sharing  –  so  that  workers  are  not  simply
replaced or left with stagnating pay while productivity soars.
Reducing Working Time (Work-Sharing):  To avoid layoffs when technology makes processes more
efficient, some unions advocate  shorter workweeks or hours with no loss in pay , effectively
spreading the remaining work among more people. A prominent example is Germany’s IG Metall
(Europe’s  largest  industrial  union),  which  has  called  for  a  four-day  workweek  (reducing  the•

standard week from 35 hours to ~28-32 hours) to preserve jobs in industries undergoing structural
change .  In  2020,  facing  both  COVID-19  and  automation  in  the  auto  sector  (e.g.  electric
vehicle production requires less labor for engines), IG Metall’s leader Jörg Hofmann argued that a
four-day week could save thousands of jobs by  avoiding redundancies  – companies would cut
hours  rather  than  headcount .  Crucially,  IG  Metall  insists  that  workers  shouldn’t  suffer
proportional pay cuts  for reduced hours, since productivity has risen; instead, some costs must be
borne by employers or supplemented by state support . This work-sharing approach, long part of
European labor strategy, is gaining renewed attention as a humane way to distribute the fruits of
automation  (more leisure time for workers, rather than unemployment).
Public Sector Employment Protections:  In government and public services, unions are similarly
vigilant. Automation in public sector contexts (e.g. municipal offices introducing AI chatbots, or
transit  systems  moving  toward  driverless  trains)  can  threaten  public  employee  jobs.  Unions
representing civil servants, transit workers, teachers, etc., often push for “no forced layoffs” clauses
and retraining or redeployment of any impacted staff. For example, in London’s public transport, the
RMT and ASLEF unions have repeatedly struck or threatened strikes to oppose ticket office closures
and driverless trains on the Underground, arguing that such automation compromises both jobs and
service quality . These unions have at times won concessions (e.g. delaying automation plans
or securing guarantees about staffing levels). The message is that even in a high-tech future, public
safety and service may require human presence , and unions will campaign to retain those human
roles or at least slow their elimination.
Through these measures, labor unions in the late 2020s are not opposing technology outright  (the old
stereotype of Luddites “smashing machines” no longer applies). Rather , unions are seeking to  shape the
trajectory  of  innovation .  They  aim  to  bargain  for  introduction  of  technology  in  ways  that  maintain
workers’ rights, ensure training and adjustment assistance, and prevent a one-sided distribution of benefits.
AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler summed up this stance in 2024, noting that in every industrial revolution,
labor’s role has been to harness technology for good – making it “productive and safe” . The
AFL-CIO has demanded a voice in AI deployment, calling the labor movement “the greatest counteracting
force to AI’s disruption” and a necessary “stabilizing force”  in the face of rapid change . In practice, this
means unions lobbying for stronger collective bargaining rights (to better negotiate tech changes), for
regulatory oversight of AI  (Shuler advocated a federal agency to pre-approve high-risk technologies, akin
to an “FDA for algorithms” ), and for public investments in worker training.
Facilitating Transitions for Displaced Workers
Even with proactive measures, automation will inevitably displace some workers. A critical question is: what
can unions do for those who lose their jobs to technology?  Between 2025 and 2035, we expect unions to
focus heavily on policies and programs to ensure  “just transitions”  for these workers – so that being
automated out of a job does not mean permanent hardship.
Key union-supported strategies include:
Retraining and Upskilling Programs:  Unions are increasingly positioning themselves as champions
of lifelong learning for workers. As jobs evolve, the ability to reskill is vital. Many unions have
negotiated  employer  commitments  to  training  in  collective  agreements,  or  partnered  with
employers/government on training initiatives. For example, unions in manufacturing and service2425

25

2829

industries have pressed companies to provide paid retraining  for workers whose jobs are changing
due to automation . If a factory installs advanced robotic equipment, the union may demand
that  existing  machine  operators  get  the  first  chance  to  be  trained  as  robot  technicians  or
maintenance specialists. In the Las Vegas case mentioned earlier , free training was guaranteed for
affected hotel workers . Likewise, the European trade union movement has strongly advocated
that  “active labor market policies”  (like the EU’s Globalisation Adjustment Fund) be expanded to
help workers retrain for the digital economy . Unions often argue for a principle of “protect
people, not jobs” – acknowledging that some jobs will vanish, but insisting that the people should be
protected through training and support . As one union-friendly researcher put it, those who lose
jobs to automation are typically not prepared for the new jobs, so investment in upskilling is essential .
Unfortunately, funding for such programs has often been woefully insufficient. Unions therefore
lobby  governments  to  dramatically  increase  support  for  worker  retraining  and  adjustment
assistance.
Stronger Unemployment and Income Supports:  Unions also push for bolstering the social safety
net for displaced workers. This includes better unemployment benefits (higher payments, longer
duration) and pension protections  for those near retirement. For example, if automation leads to
early  layoffs  of  older  workers,  unions  may  negotiate  enhanced  severance  or  early  retirement
packages – essentially a bridge to a secure pension. During the pandemic and automation-related
downturns, some unions secured extended unemployment pay and subsidized shorter workweeks.
In  Germany,  IG  Metall  in  2020  called  on  the  government  to  extend  short-time  work  benefits
(Kurzarbeit) to up to 24 months . Short-time work schemes, where the government and employer
supplement wages for workers whose hours are reduced, can be a tool to avoid layoffs during tech
transitions as well. Unions generally advocate any approach that prevents workers from falling into
poverty if their jobs disappear – whether that’s through insurance, severance, or public income
support.
Job Guarantee Programs:  In the public sector especially, unions may support the idea of a  job
guarantee  – the government acting as an employer-of-last-resort for those who cannot find private
employment. While not mainstream in 2025, the concept is gaining some interest in progressive
policy circles and labor discussions. A job guarantee could involve public works projects (including in
climate  adaptation,  education,  healthcare,  infrastructure)  that  both  provide  employment  and
address social needs. Unions would likely want any such program to offer decent wages and the
right to collective representation  for the workers. Historical precedent exists (e.g., the New Deal’s
public employment programs), and future discussions may revive these ideas as automation bites
harder . Indeed, by the late 2020s, some union-supported think tanks are exploring policies like a
federal job guarantee or large-scale public sector hiring to combat the dual pressures of automation
and inequality. For instance, climate-related projects (planting trees, building flood defenses, etc.)
could absorb workers leaving carbon-intensive automated industries, with unions ensuring these
new “green jobs” are good jobs .
Advocating Reduced Working Time  (as mentioned): work-time reduction is also a transition aid –
by lowering individual hours, it can curb redundancies. In unionized sectors, this might be pursued
through bargaining (e.g. negotiating a shift from 8-hour to 7-hour workdays, or from 5-day to 4-day
weeks with partial wage compensation). Already some experiments are underway. For example,
unions in Spain and elsewhere have backed pilot programs for a 32-hour workweek without pay loss,3233

funded partly by government to test productivity effects. The logic is that if productivity is much
higher with automation, society can afford to let people work less without reducing output.
Support for Universal Basic Income (UBI):  While unions have traditionally focused on wages for
work, the automation era has brought some union voices to consider more radical ideas like UBI.
During 2025–2035, we see a growing (though still debated) trend of union leaders and activists
engaging with UBI proposals. One high-profile example is Andy Stern , former president of the SEIU
(Service Employees International Union). After leaving union leadership, Stern became a prominent
advocate  for  UBI,  arguing  it  may  be  the  best  way  to  “eradicate  poverty”  and  deal  with  mass
unemployment from automation . Andrew Yang’s UBI-centered political campaigns in the late
2010s drew inspiration from Stern’s views . The pro-UBI argument from a labor perspective is that
if the ability to withhold labor (strike)  is no longer strong leverage – because employers don’t need
as many workers – then ensuring people have an income floor is crucial . UBI could give
workers more bargaining power by providing an “exit option” (nobody is forced  to take a bad job out
of  desperation) .  Essentially,  a  modest  UBI  functions  like  a  continuous  strike  fund,
empowering workers to refuse exploitative conditions since they won’t starve . Unions are not
universally sold on UBI; some fear it could weaken the work-based solidarity model or be used as an
excuse to dismantle other welfare provisions. But notably, younger labor activists and some union
coalitions are exploring UBI as part of the solution space  for a post-labor economy. By the early
2030s, it’s plausible we’ll see pilot UBI programs (perhaps at city or regional levels) that unions
cautiously support, especially if these programs are funded by taxes on wealth, robots, or corporate
profits (to ensure the burden falls on those benefiting most from automation). The core of the labor
movement’s interest is that UBI, if designed well,  could  strengthen worker power (by raising the
baseline of negotiation) rather than undermine it . Unions also emphasize that UBI is not a
replacement for collective bargaining  or labor rights – rather a complement to ensure basic
economic security where bargaining power is inherently weak .
Overall, in the 2025–2035 period, we anticipate labor unions will play a key role in policy debates  about
how to manage automation’s fallout. Unions and allied worker advocacy groups will lobby for robust public
policies:  funding  for  retraining,  stronger  social  safety  nets,  perhaps  shorter  workweek  standards,  and
experimentation with ideas like UBI or job guarantees. Their role will extend beyond the workplace into the
political arena, advocating for a new social contract  suited to a high-automation economy.
Structural Adaptations and New Models of Organization
To remain effective through this period, unions themselves must adapt organizationally . A few emerging
trends and experiments in the late 2020s suggest how unions are changing:
Including Non-Traditional Workers:  With the rise of the gig economy and contract work (often
facilitated by digital platforms), unions are finding ways to represent workers who aren’t “employees”
in the classic sense. For instance, the U.K.’s Independent Workers Union (IWGB) and App Drivers &
Couriers Union (ADCU) have organized gig workers like Uber drivers and Deliveroo riders, even as
their legal status was disputed. In 2021, a UK Supreme Court victory supported by worker advocates
confirmed  that  Uber  drivers  are  “workers”  entitled  to  minimum  wage  and  holiday  pay,  a  case
effectively pushed by quasi-union groups. In the U.S., traditional unions like the Teamsters have
launched campaigns to organize Amazon warehouse workers and delivery drivers, who often face
algorithmic management and high-tech workplaces. The early successes (e.g., a 2022 union win at•

an Amazon warehouse in New York) show unions expanding into sectors emblematic of advanced
automation  and  logistics.  We  expect  unions  to  broaden  membership  criteria  –  welcoming
freelancers,  contractors,  unemployed  job-seekers,  and  others  into  the  fold  through  new
membership  models.  Some  unions  have  created  associate  memberships  for  those  without  a
unionized  workplace,  offering  benefits  like  training,  legal  advice,  or  portable  benefits.  The
Freelancers Union  in the U.S., while not a collective bargaining union, exemplifies how providing a
form of mutual aid and representation to independent workers is possible. By 2030, the boundary of
who  is  a  “union  member”  will  likely  expand  beyond  the  traditional  payroll  employee.  This  is  a
necessary adaptation, as  automation blurs the line between employed and unemployed, or
between employees and gig contractors .
Sectoral  and  Broader-Based  Bargaining:  Facing  the  decline  of  firm-level  bargaining  power
(especially in fractured industries with many small employers or platforms), labor movements in
some countries push for sectoral bargaining  – setting labor standards across an entire industry or
sector .  This  model  is  common  in  Europe  (e.g.,  nation-wide  agreements  for  an  industry,  often
extended  by  law  to  all  firms).  In  the  U.S.,  policy  experts  and  unions  have  advocated  exploring
sectoral  bargaining  to  cover ,  for  example,  all  fast-food  workers  or  all  nursing  home  workers,
regardless of the individual employer . Such models could ensure baseline pay, benefits, training
funds,  etc.,  across  a  whole  sector  heavily  affected  by  tech  changes,  thus  covering  even  those
workplaces where no traditional union is present. Between 2025 and 2035, we may see experiments
or  new  laws  (at  state  or  national  levels)  enabling  broader  bargaining  units,  especially  for  gig/
platform-based  industries.  Unions  are  rethinking  strategies  to  increase  coverage  even  as
membership is hard to grow – one way is to win policies that apply to all workers (like higher
minimum wages, overtime laws, or AI regulations), effectively doing via law what they can’t do via
individual contracts. This is sometimes called “ social bargaining ” or using unions’ political clout to
achieve gains for the working class at large, not just union members.
Harnessing Technology for Organizing:  Unions are also learning to  fight fire with fire – using
digital tools and AI to empower workers . In an era where employers might use AI to surveil or
union-bust, unions can deploy countermeasures: data analytics to identify wage theft patterns, AI-
driven  communication  platforms  to  connect  with  members  and  potential  members,  and  online
platforms  for  mobilization.  A  United  Nations  University  analysis  suggested  that  unions  must
“embrace digital tools”  such as AI-powered chatbots and real-time communication apps to engage
workers who are geographically dispersed or isolated by technology . For example, instead of
traditional in-person shop-floor meetings (harder when workers are remote or gig-based), unions
might use mobile apps that allow workers to discuss issues anonymously, report violations, and
collectively strategize. By 2030, it’s likely that successful unions will be those that have modernized
their internal operations – utilizing big data to inform bargaining (e.g., analyzing company financials
with  AI),  using  social  media  effectively,  and  even  possibly  employing  AI  assistants  for  member
services.  On  the  flip  side,  cybersecurity  and  privacy  become  concerns  –  unions  must  protect
member  data  and  communications  from  employer  surveillance.  Investing  in  secure  digital
infrastructure (as some forward-looking unions are doing) will be critical.
Alliances and New Solidarity Models:  In the late 2020s, we see unions forging alliances beyond
their traditional scope – teaming up with community organizations, tech worker collectives, and even
ethical business leaders to shape the future of work. One intriguing idea emerging is the “Augment
Movement”  –  a  concept  where  international  labor  unions  collaborate  with  sympathetic  tech• 
48
•

entrepreneurs  to  steer  AI/robotics  development  toward  augmenting  human  labor  rather  than
replacing it. In a scenario sketched by futurists, the Augment Movement influenced AI design such
that many technologies in the 2020s were built to  assist workers, keeping humans in the loop ,
instead of creating fully autonomous systems . While this is partially speculative, there are
real signs of such collaboration: for example, the partnership announced in 2023 between the AFL-
CIO and Microsoft to involve union workers in AI design and to jointly develop training programs for
AI  skills .  This  labor-tech  partnership  approach  suggests  that  not  all  tech  companies  are
adversaries – some see value in consulting workers (who have frontline insights) when implementing
AI. By 2035, we may see more unions having tech committees or hiring technology specialists to
engage with employers on how AI is deployed, ensuring it truly complements workers. Unions might
also support legislation that requires algorithmic transparency and worker consultation  prior to
introducing certain AI systems (akin to how German works councils have co-determination rights on
technological changes affecting workers).
In summary, the 2025–2035 decade for labor unions is about  adaptation and proactive engagement .
Unions  will  fight  for  near-term  protections  (training,  notice  periods,  fair  wages),  help  workers  adjust
through  social  supports,  and  at  the  same  time  reinvent  their  own  structures  to  organize  a  more
fragmented, tech-driven workforce. We will now examine some concrete case studies from this period that
illustrate these strategies in action.
Case Studies (2025–2035): Union Responses to Automation
To ground the discussion, consider a few real and emerging examples of how labor unions have responded
to automation-related challenges so far:
Longshore Workers and Automation:  The introduction of robotic container cranes and automated
port terminals has threatened the jobs of dockworkers. Unions on both U.S. coasts have taken
strong  stances.  In  2022–2023  negotiations,  the  International  Longshore  and  Warehouse  Union
(ILWU) on the U.S. West Coast hotly debated automation with port operators. Although details were
kept private, it’s known that resistance to fully automated terminals was a sticking point, leading to
work slowdowns. On the East and Gulf Coasts, the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA)
achieved a notable contract in 2025 that explicitly protects against job losses from automation .
The new six-year master agreement (2025–2030) not only provided a hefty 62% wage increase  over
its term, but also included “guaranteed safeguards” that prevent employers from laying off ILA
members due to automation . This likely means any implementation of labor-saving tech must be
done  through  attrition  or  reassignment  rather  than  firing  union  workers.  The  ILA  contract
demonstrates  a  successful  union  negotiation  securing  both  economic  gains  and  technology
protections. It shows unions can still leverage their power in critical industries (ports are choke
points in supply chains) to set terms on technology use.
Auto Manufacturing – From Resistance to Re-skilling:  Automation has long been part of auto
manufacturing (robots welding, painting, etc.), but the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and AI-
driven quality control is a new wave. Unions like the UAW (United Auto Workers) in the U.S. and IG
Metall in Germany have adopted a mix of approaches. In Germany, as noted, IG Metall proposed a
four-day  week  to  save  jobs  during  the  EV  transition .  They  also  negotiated  provisions  for
training – e.g., when German automaker Volkswagen introduced more automation, its works council
(backed by IG Metall) secured commitments for retraining assembly-line workers to become EV5152

battery technicians or maintenance staff, rather than layoffs. In the U.S., the UAW’s 2023 strike
against the Big Three automakers, while largely about wages and EV production allocation, also
touched on job security in an increasingly automated, EV-centric industry. The resulting contracts
included unprecedented wage increases, suggesting unions are ensuring that increased productivity
and future profits (partly from tech improvements) translate into higher pay now . The UAW has also
been vocal about the need for a “just transition” in auto – calling for new battery and EV plants (often
less unionized) to come under union agreements, and for government EV investments to include
labor standards. This case shows unions trying to get ahead of automation  – securing a foothold in
the emerging parts of the industry and not just clinging to shrinking traditional jobs.
Entertainment and Media – Unions vs. AI:  A high-profile example in 2023 was the twin strikes by
the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and SAG-AFTRA (the actors’ union) in Hollywood. A key issue was
the use of generative AI to write scripts or create digital actors. The unions feared that studios would
use AI to replace human creativity (e.g., writing screenplay drafts via ChatGPT or scanning actors to
generate performances without pay). The outcome was a new set of contract provisions that can be
seen as a template for safeguarding human talent . The WGA’s new agreement explicitly states that AI
cannot  be  credited  as  an  author  and  writers  can’t  be  forced  to  adapt  AI-generated  material,
ensuring  that  a  human  writer’s  role  remains  central  and  compensated .  SAG-AFTRA
achieved groundbreaking rules on  “Digital Replicas”  of performers: studios must obtain actors’
consent  and negotiate compensation for any AI-generated use of their likeness or voice . For
example, if a background actor is scanned and a “digital extra” is created, the contract requires
paying that actor and not using the replica to entirely replace hiring live extras . There are
even provisions that such digital replicas cannot be used to avoid hiring actors  in the first place
. These wins are significant: they represent unions carving out  new rights in the age of AI  –
essentially intellectual property and privacy rights for workers. The entertainment unions leveraged
their collective power (shutting down productions) to set an early precedent that humans must
retain control and receive benefits when AI is used in their field. This case is likely to resonate across
other creative and white-collar industries as generative AI spreads.
Tech Industry – White-Collar Unionism and Ethics:  While tech companies have historically been
averse to unions, the late 2010s and 2020s saw a budding labor movement among tech workers
(e.g., at Google, Amazon white-collar staff, and smaller startups). These workers often raise ethical
issues  about  AI  (for  example,  opposing  development  of  AI  for  military  drones  or  surveillance).
Groups like the Alphabet Workers Union (at Google) – a minority union – emerged, showing a model
of collective action that isn’t mainly about wages (tech pay is high) but about the  direction of
technology and protections for workers’ voices . As automation progresses, more tech workers
could unionize to demand influence in corporate decisions, such as ensuring AI is deployed ethically
and that tech workforce reductions (through offshoring or automation) are handled responsibly.
There was also a notable partnership: the AFL-CIO and Microsoft’s 2023 initiative to involve workers
in AI development and policy . This unusual labor-management collaboration suggests a model
where unions are not just adversaries but advisors in technological innovation, aiming to align it
with worker interests. If successful, it could serve as a blueprint for other companies to follow,
potentially reducing antagonism and creating more worker-driven innovation processes .
Public Sector – The IBM Japan Case:  In Japan, enterprise unions are common (each large company
has its union). A landmark case occurred at IBM Japan, where the company had begun using an AI
system to evaluate employee performance (for raises and promotions). The IBM Japan union (part of•

JMITU) was concerned about transparency and bias. They took the issue to the Tokyo Labor Relations
Commission and in 2024 reached a groundbreaking agreement : IBM Japan agreed to disclose to
the union the 40 data items  the AI uses in evaluations and how they influence decisions .
The union will also have a monitoring role to ensure the AI’s decisions don’t violate worker rights
. This is one of the first examples of a union securing algorithmic transparency from an employer .
It shows how unions can utilize legal avenues to ensure that when AI is used in managing workers, it
does not become a black box. Japan’s labor unions, often seen as cooperative, here demonstrated
they can assert new rights in the digital workplace. As domestic laws didn’t yet cover AI in HR, the
union’s action filled the gap . We expect to see more such cases globally: unions pressing for
disclosure  of  algorithmic  decision-making  criteria,  to  prevent  hidden  discrimination  or  unfair
treatment. It’s essentially the extension of the union’s role into the realm of data governance and
AI ethics  at work.
Each of these case studies – docks, auto, Hollywood, tech, and IBM Japan – highlights different facets of the
union  response.  Common  threads  include  innovative  bargaining ,  use  of  strikes  or  leverage  in  key
chokepoints, and sometimes collaboration in shaping outcomes. Not every attempt succeeds (there have
been failures too, like instances where companies automated and unions could only protest unsuccessfully
– for example, U.K. print unions in the 1980s infamously lost the fight against computerized typesetting,
and those jobs vanished). However , the 2025–2035 period is characterized by unions striving to  not be
caught flat-footed . They are learning from past failures and actively engaging with automation issues as
they unfold.
2035–2050: Transformation and Reinvention of Unions
Looking further ahead to the 2035–2050 period, we enter a speculative but informed analysis of how the
trends might evolve. If the 2020s were about  reactive adaptation , the 2035–2050 era will likely require
fundamental transformation  of labor unions and labor relations. By the mid-2030s, automation and AI
could reach a tipping point: artificial general intelligence (AGI) might emerge in some form in the 2030s, as
some  futurists  predict ,  and  a  majority  of  routine  work  (both  physical  and  cognitive)  may  be  fully
automated by 2040. Entire occupational categories – from truck drivers to bookkeepers to assembly-line
workers – might largely disappear . At the same time, new job categories will appear (for instance, AI ethics
auditors, robot maintenance specialists, virtual reality experience designers, etc.), but the net balance is
uncertain.  Some  scenarios  foresee  technological  unemployment  at  levels  not  seen  since  the  Great
Depression (where unemployment was ~25% in the 1930s). Indeed, researchers have warned that upwards
of 40% of current jobs could be automated by 2050  in advanced economies , a figure that portends a
massive shake-up of how society conceives of “work.”
In a  post-labor  future, the role of unions cannot simply be a continuation of the status quo. If only a
minority of adults are employed in traditional jobs by 2050 (with others in part-time gigs, creative pursuits,
caregiving roles, or supported by social programs), unions must evolve into something beyond just “trade
unions” tied to specific trades or employers. They may morph into broader  social movements or civic
organizations  championing the economic rights of people generally, not just workers. Gadi Nissim and
Tomer Simon, in a 2021 scholarly article, argue that unions should  “transform their primary calling from
representing employees to representing the social rights of all citizens, particularly the material interests of lay
people” . This implies a shift from workplace-based organizing to class-based or community-based
organizing.6364

Evolving Union Ideology and Mission
By 2035–2050, we expect unions to increasingly frame their mission in terms of  economic justice and
democratic voice in the economy as a whole . If the majority of productive work is done by machines
owned  by  a  few  corporations,  then  the  central  issue  becomes  how  the  fruits  of  that  productivity  are
distributed. Unions, in coalition with other civil society groups, could be the ones negotiating that social
distribution – essentially bargaining not just with one employer , but with the state and capital as a whole for
policies like universal basic income, public services, and wealth redistribution.
In ideological terms, this is a pivot from “protecting jobs” to protecting people irrespective of jobs . We can
outline some key ideological/mission changes for unions in this era:
From  Wage  Bargaining  to  Social  Bargaining:  Unions  may  put  relatively  less  emphasis  on
bargaining for incremental wage increases at company level (since many members might not have a
conventional employer or any job at all), and more on bargaining through politics for  universal
economic benefits . This could include lobbying for a robust UBI or minimum income floor , universal
healthcare, free education, housing guarantees, etc. Essentially, unions could align with movements
for a stronger welfare state or even new models like a “Universal Basic Dividend”  (where citizens
receive  dividends  from  national  wealth  or  automation  gains).  In  a  scenario  where  automation
drastically concentrates wealth (think tech giants controlling AI that produces enormous value with
few workers), unions might fight for mechanisms like a robot tax  or sovereign wealth funds that tax
or invest in automation and pay out dividends to the populace. Already in the 2020s, there are
debates  on  taxing  automation  (Bill  Gates  famously  suggested  taxing  robots).  By  the  2030s,  if
unemployment is rising due to AI, such proposals will gain urgency. Unions will likely be major
proponents, as they recognize that traditional wage negotiation reaches its limits in a world with
declining employment.
Representation of the Unemployed and Marginalized:  Unions might open their membership to
anyone  concerned  about  economic  justice,  not  only  current  workers.  Historically,  unions  have
sometimes organized the unemployed (e.g., in the 1930s some labor organizations had unemployed
councils). In the future, we might see “ general unions ” or labor networks where being employed is
not a prerequisite. Retirees, the unemployed, students – all could be part of a broad labor movement
demanding  their  share  of  the  nation’s  prosperity.  The  focus  would  be  on  solidarity  across
employment status . For instance, unions could run mutual aid funds or community cooperatives
that  benefit  members  regardless  of  job  status.  They  could  become  service  hubs  –  providing
everything from training (even if not tied to a specific job) to financial advice to group purchasing
power for utilities or insurance. In other words, unions could evolve into multi-faceted associations
defending the right to a decent life  in an era when a stable job is no longer the norm.
Ethical Voice and Democratic Oversight of AI:  As AI permeates society, questions of oversight and
control become paramount. Unions may assert themselves as a democratic counterweight to AI
decision-makers. By 2040, it’s conceivable that AI systems will govern many aspects of work and
daily life  (hiring, performance evals, loan approvals, even medical triage). Unions, alongside other
NGOs,  could  demand  and  secure  seats  on  governing  bodies  that  oversee  these  systems  –  for
example, pushing for algorithmic audit boards that include worker representatives or community
members.  They  might  also  engage  in  standard-setting  for  “human-centered  AI” .  One  could
imagine international labor federations collaborating to influence global norms on AI ethics, much• 
• 
• 
12
as they did for labor standards in the 20th century. The concept of “Human in the loop”  – always
having  human  oversight  over  AI  decisions  –  might  be  a  rallying  principle,  ensuring  technology
complements rather than fully replaces human judgment, especially in areas impacting people’s
livelihoods and rights.
Continued Role in Workplaces : It’s important to note that even in 2050, not  all jobs will vanish.
Certain sectors will likely still have substantial human employment: healthcare (the human touch in
care work may remain valued), education (people may still prefer human teachers or mentors for
higher-level learning, albeit assisted by AI), creative fields, artisanal and custom work, and parts of
the  service  sector  where  human  experience  is  a  selling  point  (hospitality,  bespoke  services).
Additionally, new industries we can’t yet foresee will employ people. Unions will continue to organize
these workers. However , these jobs may be highly skilled or specialized, requiring a different style of
unionism (more like professional associations or guilds ensuring standards and fair pay in high-skill
fields). For instance, if by 2050 many jobs are in tech maintenance or creative endeavors, unions
might operate akin to today’s actors’ guilds or professional societies – setting pay scales, intellectual
property rights, etc., for those workers. Unions may also emphasize  lifelong learning as part of
membership  – effectively functioning like talent agencies or training institutions to keep members
employable in changing fields. This blurs the line between union and professional guild, but it could
be a natural evolution when large homogeneous workforces are rarer .
“Co-ownership” and New Business Models:  Facing the dominance of capital-owned automation,
unions  might  champion  new  ownership  models  that  give  workers  (and  the  public)  stakes  in
automated enterprises. This could include employee cooperatives that own AI tools , or pushing
for public ownership of certain critical automated infrastructures (for example, if trucking is fully
automated, perhaps a public utility model for the AI truck fleet with revenue shared). There is
historical precedent in the labor movement for cooperatives and co-determination (like Germany’s
system of worker representation on company boards). By mid-century, we might see more radical
versions:  unions  could  facilitate  the  creation  of  platform  cooperatives  (worker-owned  gig
platforms)  as  alternatives  to  Uber/Amazon-type  monopolies,  ensuring  that  even  if  work  is
intermediated by tech, workers collectively share the profits. Already, there are small examples
(driver-owned ride-hailing apps in some cities). If these models prove viable, unions in 2035–2050
might pivot to being incubators of worker-owned enterprises , essentially helping workers become
both labor and capital. 
Global Solidarity and Transnational Action:  Automation is a global phenomenon, and by 2050, the
distinction between developed and developing nations might blur in terms of tech adoption (robots
may be widespread even in currently lower-wage countries, as robot costs drop). Labor unions
historically organized primarily within national borders, but the future might force a more global
approach.  We  might  see  international  union  federations  negotiating  directly  with  multinational
corporations or at forums like the ILO for global agreements on managing automation (for instance,
a global agreement on AI ethics in workplaces, or on just transition funding for workers worldwide).
The  Millennium Project’s  scenario envisioned an “Augment Movement” led by  international labor
unions  coordinating their efforts to direct AI development in a pro-worker way . Whether or not
that  exact  scenario  unfolds,  it  underlines  the  potential  for  cross-border  labor  campaigns.  An
example could be a coordinated demand for a global minimum tax on automated industries  to
fund social programs – something akin to climate agreements but for automation’s social impact. As• 
• 
•

13
issues like AI super-intelligence or biotech arise, unions may align with scientific and civil groups
globally to ensure these technologies don’t run roughshod over human interests.
Policy and Institutional Changes
During 2035–2050, we also expect significant changes in labor law and institutions to accommodate the
new reality:
Legal  Frameworks  for  Representation:  As  noted  by  some  analysts,  current  labor  laws  (which
require a certain percentage of employees to form a bargaining unit in a workplace) might become
obsolete when workplaces have very few employees. If a factory has 10 humans and 100 robots, a
union might not meet a threshold to be recognized . Legislators may need to  lower the
barriers  for union representation or devise alternative representation mechanisms. For instance,
laws could allow industry-wide worker associations to have standing, or mandate works councils
even  in  small  automated  firms.  The  concept  of  “labor  trustees”  could  emerge,  where  unions
represent interests of future workers or laid-off workers in corporate governance (e.g., having a
union rep on a company’s board even if the workforce is small, to represent the community’s stake).
Some experts argue for adjusting co-determination and representation thresholds precisely because
of automation’s impact .
Universal Basic Income / Social Safety Net Reality:  By the 2040s, if large-scale joblessness is
reality, policies like UBI might actually be implemented in some form. Suppose, for instance, that
one or more countries in Europe adopt a nationwide UBI funded by high taxes on automation gains
– unions would likely have been a driving force behind winning that policy. Once something like UBI
is in place, the role of unions shifts more toward  ensuring the UBI (or similar programs) stays
sufficient and is improved over time , and preventing erosion or misuse (for example, making sure
UBI  supplements  rather  than  replaces  other  benefits,  or  that  it’s  not  used  as  an  excuse  for
companies to pay even lower wages). Unions might administer aspects of it, or help people navigate
between jobs and training while on UBI.
Education  and  Conversion  Programs:  Society  might  normalize  mid-life  career  changes  and
constant upskilling. Unions, in partnership with educational institutions, could help create a system
where workers regularly go through paid sabbaticals for training . This could be institutionalized
(e.g., every worker gets x months of paid training every y years, via a fund contributed by employers
and  government  –  an  idea  some  countries  like  France  have  toyed  with  in  “individual  learning
accounts”). By 2050, the norm could be that people cycle between work, training, and perhaps gig
projects. Unions would advocate for these rights and perhaps run training centers. An analogy is
how some unions today run apprenticeship programs (like building trades unions operate training
for electricians, plumbers, etc.). In future, unions might run “automation transition colleges” for
displaced workers to learn new skills (be it programming, creative arts, or skilled trades that remain
in demand).
Cultural and Societal Role:  With more free time (if workweeks shorten or many are jobless by
necessity), unions could also take on a quasi-community role. One can envision labor halls becoming
community  centers  where  people  engage  in  continued  learning,  civic  activities,  or  cooperative
businesses. The labor movement may thus contribute to answering the big question: “If people aren’t
needed for labor as much, what meaningful activities and roles will society provide?”  Unions might help• 
7273

fill that void by facilitating volunteerism, public works, or cultural projects for their members. This
goes  beyond  traditional  collective  bargaining  into  the  realm  of  ensuring  social  cohesion  and
purposeful engagement in a post-labor world.
Potential New Strategies and Innovations
Let’s consider some  novel strategies  that might be required or attempted by labor unions approaching
2050, thinking from first principles:
Collective Bargaining with AI Itself:  A provocative idea is whether future AI-driven enterprises
could  negotiate  autonomously.  If  AI  systems  run  companies  (deciding  schedules,  output,  etc.),
unions might literally end up bargaining with an AI . In one sci-fi scenario, AI entities might even be
granted  corporate  personhood  or  rights .  Unions  would  then  have  to  develop  expertise  to
engage  with  algorithmic  “bosses”  –  perhaps  employing  their  own  “AI  negotiators”  to  counter
corporate AI in negotiations. While fanciful, the kernel here is that unions will need cutting-edge
expertise in data science and AI to match the tech sophistication of employers. They may have AI
assistants  analyzing  employer  proposals,  modeling  economic  scenarios,  and  advising  human
negotiators.
“Algorithmic Unions” and Data Leverage:  With so much data being produced (by workers, by
consumers), control of data could be a form of power . Unions might organize workers around their
data rights . For example, if gig workers’ driving data or performance metrics are valuable, unions
could collectively bargain over how that data is used or even demand a share of the value from it.
This leads to the concept of “ data dividends ” or collective data trusts, where individuals pool their
data and negotiate its sale or use. A union of drivers might collectively decide what telematics data
to share with their platform and on what terms (perhaps in exchange for extra pay or profit share).
In essence, workers’ digital footprints become a bargaining chip.
Community Wealth Building:  Unions could partner with local governments on community wealth
initiatives  –  e.g.,  ensuring  that  if  a  factory  automates  and  lays  off  workers,  the  company  or
government  provides  investment  for  new  enterprises  in  that  community  (maybe  a  worker
cooperative or public tech incubator). Unions might push for contractual clauses or laws requiring
companies that automate to pay into a fund for affected communities. This is akin to environmental
policies where polluters pay for restoration; here, “labor displacers” pay for economic renewal. Over
time,  this  could  create  a  pool  of  capital  that  unions  or  communities  control  to  invest  in  new
businesses or social projects, thus democratically recycling the gains from automation .
Maintaining Worker Engagement:  In a world where work is scarce, keeping workers engaged in
unionism is a challenge – some may feel “unions are for jobs, and I don’t have one.” To counter this,
unions might broaden their appeal by focusing on quality-of-life issues: for instance, negotiating
discounts for members on various services (a bit like how AARP in the U.S. provides benefits for
retirees – unions could do that for all). They could also champion  shorter working life  (maybe
pushing for earlier retirement age as life is about more than work). If productivity allows, why not
retire at 55 with full benefits? That could be a union goal for mid-century, trading the productivity
bounty for leisure and volunteerism. Unions have historically fought for retirement security; in a
post-labor economy, ensuring everyone can retire or pursue non-work passions earlier could be a
powerful vision.•

Guarding  Against  a  Neo-Servitude:  One  dystopian  risk  is  that  as  good  jobs  dwindle,  those
remaining are extremely exploitative (a “winner-takes-all” economy where a few have precarious gigs
serving the wealthy). Unions in 2050 will be the bulwark to prevent a neo-feudal scenario. They
might campaign for dignity in all work , ensuring even domestic workers, caretakers, or platform
gig workers have rights and decent conditions. By then, perhaps domestic work unions (already
forming today) will be widespread, and unions will ensure that humans are not relegated to only the
scraps  that  robots  can’t  do  and that  those  scraps  are  respected  (through  fair  pay  and  labor
standards). Essentially, unions must assert the  irreducible value of human labor and creativity ,
even if machines dominate economically. This could take the form of promoting cultural and creative
industries, valuing care work, and securing public funding for jobs that are more about human
connection  (for  instance,  more  teachers,  elder  caregivers,  arts  programs)  which  might  not  be
“profitable”  but  enrich  society.  Unions  could  align  with  other  social  movements  to  argue:  as
productivity skyrockets, society can afford  to pay people to do socially useful but non-automatable
work (which could be state-funded). 
Re-imagining Strikes and Leverage:  If striking in the traditional sense loses bite (because machines
keep production going), unions will invent new forms of collective action. One idea is the “data strike”
– workers (or even users) could collectively withhold their data or interaction that AI systems need.
For  example,  if  a  company’s  AI  customer  service  learns  from  real  interactions,  what  if  users
coordinated to boycott or feed it wrong data? More realistically, unions may turn to  consumer
campaigns or alliances : encouraging the public not to use fully automated services that undermine
labor . We see hints of this in “human-made” or “fair labor” branding. By 2050 there might be a
premium on products made or tended by humans (as a luxury or ethical choice). Unions could certify
and promote these, leveraging consumer power . Another leverage point: political strikes – essentially
making a cause out of tech justice and rallying broad support (like global climate strikes, we could
see global “job justice strikes” pressuring governments). Unions might coordinate one-day general
strikes or demonstrations not for immediate wage demands but for policies (UBI, robot tax, etc.).
Already in Europe, general strikes are used for political goals; this could expand worldwide with
automation as a unifying issue.
In all these potential strategies, the through-line is that  unions must reinvent themselves from shop-
floor grievance handlers to shapers of societal direction . The late 21st-century unionist might be less a
wage negotiator and more a social visionary, community organizer , and policy advocate. 
2050 and Beyond: A Glimpse into a Post-Labor Society
By 2050 and thereafter , developed nations could reach a point that has been described as “post-work” or
“post-labor” in the sense that a large fraction of economic output is generated with minimal human labor .
This doesn’t necessarily mean zero work – but possibly work becomes optional or radically redefined  for
many. Let’s consider two broad scenarios and the role of unions in each:
High-Tech  Utopia  (Equitable  Post-Labor  Scenario):  In  this  scenario,  productivity  gains  from
automation are shared broadly. Policies like UBI, free public services, or shorter workweeks are fully
implemented,  so  individuals  can  maintain  a  decent  standard  of  living  with  little  or  no  formal
employment. Work is something people do by choice – perhaps for passion, purpose, or extra
income – rather than survival. Unions in this world might not look like traditional unions, but the
labor  movement’s  legacy  would  be  visible  in  the  institutionalization  of  economic  rights .  For• 
• 
1. 
16
example, the existence of a robust UBI could be credited to decades of labor advocacy. Unions (or
their evolved entities) would continue to act as watchdogs: ensuring the level of UBI is adequate and
adjusts with productivity, ensuring that even in an automated economy the  dignity  and  agency  of
individuals are respected. They might also take on roles like co-managing communal resources or
large automated infrastructures (for instance, perhaps a union-like body sits on the board governing
a national AI utility to voice public interest). Essentially, in a good scenario, many of the goals of the
labor movement (shorter labor , security for all, ending poverty) could be achieved, and unions would
have helped push society there. Their role then transitions to guarding those achievements  and
pushing further (maybe advocating for even higher standards of living, or focusing on non-economic
issues like equality, climate justice, etc., since basic economic struggle is tamed).
High-Tech Dystopia (Unequal Post-Labor Scenario):  In a bleaker scenario, automation’s gains are
captured  by  a  small  elite  (corporations  or  owners  of  AI  capital),  while  masses  of  people  are
unemployed or stuck in low-paying gigs, with weakened bargaining power . Inequality would be
extreme. Labor rights might be eroded as desperation for jobs undercuts standards. In such a
scenario, the role of unions becomes even more vital as one of the few countervailing forces. Unions
(or what remains of them) could be at the forefront of social upheaval or movements for systemic
change .  They  might  align  with  populist  or  radical  movements  calling  for  wealth  redistribution,
perhaps even a different economic system (some argue fully automated economies make a case for
forms  of  socialism  or  cooperative  commonwealth,  since  traditional  capitalism  fails  to  allocate
resources justly when labor isn’t needed). Unions could transform into revolutionary organizations in
the worst case, leading protests, strikes, and possibly unrest to demand change – much like labor
movements did in the 19th century when faced with dire worker exploitation, but now the fight
would be against marginalization by technology. If democratic means fail, one can imagine unions
fueling political movements to ensure stability – because a society of millions of “surplus” people
with no economic role is unstable. We might see modern equivalents of the labor wars of the past.
However , it’s likely that long before reaching that dystopia, unions and allies would have galvanized
enough political will to implement some mitigating policies (society would attempt a UBI or public
jobs, etc., rather than face constant unrest).
In both scenarios, it’s clear that collective representation doesn’t become obsolete  – it simply shifts form.
As long as there are power imbalances (and in a world of AI and capital, power imbalances could be huge),
there is a need for collective voice and negotiation. The solidarity principle – that people are stronger
together – will remain relevant. It might be solidarity among all citizens  rather than just workers, as the
2021 paper suggested . 
We  can  expect  that  by  2050,  the  language  might  change:  “labor  unions”  could  be  called  “ economic
citizenship unions ” or “social unions.” They might welcome anyone who believes in democratic control over
the economy’s direction. The constituency might effectively be the entire working-class broadly defined
(including those not in formal work). 
One could argue that in a sense, if full automation frees humanity from work, the ultimate goal of labor
unions (liberation from toil and fair distribution of wealth) aligns with that outcome – but only if governance
of that automated wealth is democratized. Thus, the  final frontier for unions  might be to ensure that
automated systems are governed in the public interest. This could even extend to algorithmic ownership :
perhaps unions or public trusts will own key AIs or have open-source AI that communities control, to break
the monopoly of tech giants. By mid-century, the notion of “Who owns the robots? Who writes the rules for2. 
7770
17
AI?” will be as important as “who owns the means of production?” was in the past. Unions, representing the
many, will likely be on the side of pushing those robots and AIs to be accountable to society, not just profit. 
To conclude, labor unions in developed nations are poised to undergo a dramatic evolution from now
through 2050 and beyond. In the near term, they are defending workers’ rights in the face of accelerating
automation  through  bargaining,  advocacy,  and  innovative  contracts.  In  the  medium  term,  they  are
reinventing their structures to represent a workforce in flux – including gig workers, the displaced, and
those in new tech-driven roles – while fighting for broader social protections like retraining, reduced work
time,  and  income  guarantees.  In  the  long  term,  unions  could  transform  into  guardians  of  universal
economic rights and democratic stewards of automation’s bounty, or alternatively, become the leaders of
social resistance if the benefits of automation are hoarded by the few. 
The story of organized labor has always been one of adaptation to economic change: from craft guilds
facing early mechanization, to industrial unions in the factory age, to service sector unions in the late 20th
century. The coming “post-labor” age will be its greatest test yet. But as history suggests, so long as there
are collective challenges, there will be collective organizing to meet them. The values of solidarity, fairness,
and human dignity at work – or beyond work – will remain the compass by which labor unions, whatever
they may be called by 2050, chart their course.
Comparative Outlook by Region and Sector
Finally, it’s worth highlighting some regional and sectoral differences  in this trajectory, as the specifics will
vary:
United  States:  With  its  relatively  weak  labor  protections  and  low  union  density,  the  US  labor
movement faces steep challenges. In the short run, U.S. unions (AFL-CIO and others) are lobbying for
labor law reform (e.g., making unionization easier) to rebuild membership , which would help
workers bargain over automation. Absent legal change, U.S. unions rely on public support and bold
tactics (strikes, campaigns like the Fight for $15) to push for improvements. By 2035, if the policy
environment becomes more favorable (for instance, if sectoral bargaining or more robust social
safety nets are adopted at state levels), U.S. unions could regain some influence. The private sector
in the US is highly market-driven, so without union pressure or regulation, companies may adopt
automation in a “profits-first” way. Thus, U.S. unions focus on strengthening collective bargaining
rights as a prerequisite  to any humane automation management . Public sector unions in
the US (teachers, government workers) remain relatively strong and will likely be on the forefront of
advocating policies like shorter hours or no layoffs via attrition in government. By 2050, if inequality
grows  sharply,  the  U.S.  could  see  more  radical  labor  activism,  possibly  aligning  with  broader
movements for economic justice. If instead progressive policies take root (like a national healthcare
or UBI), it may be due in part to union political advocacy.
European Union:  Many EU countries have institutionalized roles for unions in governance (tripartite
bodies,  works  councils,  etc.),  which  may  give  them  a  head  start  in  managing  automation.  For
example, German works councils already have a say in introduction of new tech at workplaces under
co-determination  laws .  Scandinavian  unions  administer  unemployment  funds  (the  Ghent
system), positioning them to manage transitions effectively. In the near term, EU unions are pushing
for continent-wide regulations – such as the proposed  EU Directive on AI in the workplace  – to
ensure worker consultation and rights are built into the digital economy . The public sector in•

Europe is large and typically heavily unionized; these unions will likely insist that automation in
public  services  is  used  to  augment  service  (e.g.,  reduce  backlogs,  free  up  staff  for  personal
interaction)  and  not  to  cut  headcount  drastically.  Europe’s  stronger  social  safety  net  (universal
healthcare, etc.) provides a cushion that unions elsewhere fight for . By 2050, EU might achieve more
of the utopian scenario if its social model persists – shorter workweeks, perhaps earlier retirement
ages, and robust social insurance, with unions playing a custodial role. However , Europe also has to
maintain  economic  competitiveness,  so  unions  are  aware  of  balancing  worker  protection  with
encouraging innovation (the “competitiveness pact”). The outcome likely varies by country: e.g.,
Nordic countries  could exemplify the smooth transition model (high automation adoption and high
worker  security),  whereas  some  others  might  struggle  if  unemployment  rises  and  politics  turn
against strong welfare states.
United Kingdom:  The UK’s trajectory post-Brexit is somewhat between the US and EU models. Union
density is modest (~22%) , but unions like the Trades Union Congress (TUC) have significant
political voice on issues like AI and work hours. The UK has seen major strikes in recent years (rail,
postal, healthcare), showing a resurgence of labor activism. In the short term, UK unions advocate
modernizing labor laws and have floated ideas like a 4-day workweek  as a general policy. How the
government responds (supportive or restrictive) will shape outcomes. The public sector in the UK
(NHS, education, transport) is heavily unionized and often at the center of debates on automation
(e.g.,  using  AI  in  healthcare,  or  automating  trains).  These  unions  often  frame  automation  as
potentially beneficial if used to reduce workload – for instance, NHS unions might welcome AI that
handles routine diagnostics if it frees doctors and nurses to spend more time with patients, but they
will fight if it’s used to justify cutting staff. By 2050, UK’s social model may converge somewhat with
Europe if political winds shift to more social democratic governance (which could strengthen union
influence in policymaking), or it might lean American if market liberalism dominates (making unions
more combative outsiders). Either way, UK unions will likely continue a dual strategy: direct action
(strikes, organizing new sectors) and policy lobbying for safety nets (they’ve already been vocal
about regulating AI and gig work).
Japan:  Japan presents a unique case. It has high automation adoption (robots in manufacturing, etc.)
but also a shrinking workforce due to aging. Japanese companies historically practiced life-time
employment and have enterprise unions that cooperate with management. This has meant fewer
mass layoffs  from automation so far – instead companies reassign workers or let the workforce
shrink naturally. Japanese unions (through the Rengo federation) have started to address issues like
AI in evaluations (the IBM case is an example of union assertiveness emerging) . Culturally,
there  may  be  a  greater  acceptance  of  technology  as  helping  society,  which  could  mean  less
adversarial approaches. For example, robots are seen as necessary in elder care and services due to
worker shortages; unions might actually support this to ease the burden on human workers, as long
as it’s not exploitative. By 2035, Japan might implement policies like phased retirement  or reduced
hours in lieu of layoffs, aligning with the country’s need to keep older workers employed longer
(given demographic pressures). By 2050, Japan could face severe labor scarcity (a smaller population)
and high automation – possibly achieving a balance where robots fill many roles and human workers
are still in demand to fill the gaps. Japanese unions might evolve to focus on ensuring  quality of
work-life  for those working (since labor will be precious) and representing a more diverse workforce
(including  foreign  guest  workers,  who  may  come  in  larger  numbers).  They  may  also  push  for
national strategies like a basic income if traditional employment contracts erode. The cooperative
labor relations model might be an asset: rather than battle, unions and employers might jointly•

manage automation’s rollout in Japan, aiming for mutual gains (productivity for firms, security for
workers).
By Sector:
Manufacturing:  High automation, but also historically high unionization in some countries. Expect
continued use of work-sharing and retraining deals. Unions will ensure maintenance and technical
roles remain union jobs. Sector might shrink in employment drastically by 2050, so unions may
either dwindle in influence or shift those members into new sectors (many manufacturing unions
are diversifying into general industrial unions covering logistics, etc.).
Service/Retail:  Automation here (self-checkouts, AI customer service, online shopping replacing
stores) hits a sector that is often less unionized (especially in US). Unions have been trying to
organize retail and fast food. By 2050, many low-wage service jobs could vanish; those remaining
might be higher-touch (boutique experiences, etc.). Unions in this sector might focus on organizing
platform-based work (like delivery or warehouse jobs) and pushing for social supports for displaced
service workers. We may see unions in new service niches (e.g., unions of platform-employed care
workers or tutors).
Healthcare:  Likely to remain labor-intensive, though AI will assist diagnostics and record-keeping.
Healthcare unions will champion that automation should augment caregivers  (e.g., AI does
paperwork so nurses can nurse). There’s potential for conflict if private healthcare providers try to
use tech to cut staff, but strong public sentiment for patient safety usually aligns with union
arguments for enough human staff. By 2050, healthcare might be one of the largest unionized
sectors (as others shrink), and these unions could be powerful voices for both workers and quality of
care.
Transportation:  We’ll see a divide – highly automated (trucking, perhaps rail) vs. areas where
humans remain (airline pilots maybe, or specialized operators). Unions like pilots’ unions might fight
to keep a human in the loop for safety. Driverless trucking could displace truck drivers (a huge
occupation). Teamsters and others are already strategizing – one idea is to bargain for rules that
each autonomous truck still has a human supervisor (maybe remotely) who is a union driver , or that
trucking companies fund transition programs for drivers. By 2050, if most trucks drive themselves,
the union of truckers might transform into a union of logistics specialists  overseeing robot fleets,
or a political lobbying group ensuring those ex-truckers get a fair deal (perhaps via something like a
guaranteed job in infrastructure or a pension at mid-life).
Public Sector/Education:  These might become the stronghold of human employment for longer ,
since demand is social and governments might resist full automation if it’s unpopular with citizens
(e.g., fully replacing teachers with AI might not be acceptable to the public). Public sector unions will
push for productivity gains from tech to translate into better service or reduced workloads, not job
cuts. They also often lead in pushing progressive policies (many union federations globally are led by
public sector unionists). By 2050, if many private jobs are gone, public employment might be
expanded as part of job guarantee schemes (for example, government hiring people for
environmental or care projects). Unions would certainly support that expansion because it increases
their base and fulfills their social mission.
In conclusion, while the  core challenges  posed by a “post-labor” future are common across regions –
technological  displacement,  weakened  worker  bargaining,  the  need  for  new  social  contracts  –  the
approaches and pace  will differ . Countries with strong labor institutions and social safety nets (like much of
Europe and potentially Japan) have mechanisms to negotiate these changes more smoothly, often with
union involvement in policy-setting. Countries with weaker labor institutions (like the US) may experience•

more conflict and require significant political change for unions to regain influence. But everywhere, unions
(or  successor  organizations)  will  be  crucial  in  striving  to  ensure  that  the  transition  to  an  automated
economy is humane, equitable, and inclusive , rather than dystopian.
Conclusion
The period from 2025 to 2050 and beyond will test the very fabric of labor unions, but also reaffirm their
importance in new ways. As automation accelerates, labor unions are evolving from traditional collective
bargaining agents to broader champions of worker welfare and social justice  in an automated age. In
the near term, they are actively negotiating the terms of technology adoption – securing provisions for
notice, training, and fair compensation when AI and robots enter the workplace. They are also pushing for
policy innovations like shorter workweeks and robust retraining programs to cushion workers from job
disruptions. By the 2030s and 2040s, unions are poised to transform structurally, expanding their reach to
non-traditional workers, embracing digital tools, and shifting their focus toward securing economic dignity
for  all  –  whether  through  advocating  universal  basic  income,  job  guarantees,  or  co-determination  in
management of AI.
Comparative case studies – from IG Metall’s four-day week proposal to SAG-AFTRA’s AI protections, from
dockworkers  winning  automation  safeguards  to  Japanese  unions  achieving  algorithmic  transparency  –
show that unions can still win significant victories in shaping the future of work . These victories also
offer  templates  and  hope  for  other  sectors.  Unions  have  shown  they  can  adapt:  they  have  begun  to
organize gig workers via new models, they have taken on tech giants on issues of AI ethics, and they are
engaging in policy debates about how to distribute the wealth of automation.
The long-term vision emerging is that labor unions (or their future incarnations) may become guardians of
a  post-labor social contract  – one that ensures that when machines do more of the work, humans still
reap the benefits in terms of free time, security, and improved quality of life. Far from being irrelevant,
collective worker organizations might be the key force to demand that the coming prosperity is shared. As
one analysis put it, unions in a post-labor economy have a “ crucial role to safeguard workers’ interests in
the transition and then reinvent themselves to represent the social rights of all citizens ” . 
Of course, the path will not be easy. There will be industries and regions where union influence continues to
wane, and workers may feel powerless against technology and the capital behind it. But history reminds us
that periods of great technological upheaval – from the industrial revolution to the digital revolution – have
also given rise to stronger labor movements and new forms of solidarity. The coming decades could see a
renaissance of labor activism, driven by the very pressures that once threatened to weaken it. Unions may
very well innovate as much as the technologies around them, finding new ways to collectivize bargaining
power in a world of algorithms and gigabytes.
In summation, the evolving role of labor unions in a heavily automated future  will be multifaceted: they
will act as negotiators ensuring fair implementation of tech in workplaces, as advocates for social and
economic policies to support displaced workers, as innovators of new organizing models, and as moral
stewards advocating that technology serve humanity, not disenfranchise it. Whether through securing a 20-
hour workweek with full pay by 2050, winning a universal income funded by robot taxation, or co-owning AI
platforms collectively, the labor movement’s ideas today could become the foundation of a more equitable
post-labor society tomorrow. The continued commitment to solidarity – “an injury to one is an injury to all”  –
might well expand to “an injury to any citizen is an injury to society”  in the era of automation. The story is still69

being written, but one thing is clear: even a post-labor future needs a strong labor voice  to ensure it is a
future for the many, not just the few.
