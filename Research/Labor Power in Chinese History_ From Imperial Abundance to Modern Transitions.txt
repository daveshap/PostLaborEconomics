Labor Power in Chinese History: From Imperial
Abundance to Modern Transitions
Introduction
China’s vast population has been both a source of strength and a challenge to its rulers throughout history.
From  the  early  imperial  dynasties  through  the  present,  Chinese  states  have  had  to  manage  an
extraordinarily large labor force, concentrated especially in fertile regions like the Yellow River and Yangtze
River valleys. Historically, this abundance of people shaped the state’s calculus of labor as a  renewable,
fungible resource  – a seemingly inexhaustible well of manpower that could be mobilized for agriculture,
infrastructure,  and  war .  The  result  was  a  pattern  in  which  individual  lives  were  often  undervalued  by
authorities  amid  the  macro-scale  needs  of  empire.  Over  time,  however ,  demographic  shifts  –  from
devastating population losses in rebellions or famines to the recent looming population decline of the 21st
century – have altered this dynamic. In the contemporary era, labor has become relatively scarcer and more
valuable, prompting shifts in state policies such as the relaxation of strict birth control and household
registration  rules.  This  report  provides  a  comprehensive  historical  overview  of  labor  power  in  China,
examining rural and urban contexts across major periods (Imperial, Republican, Maoist, Reform & Opening,
and contemporary). It compiles demographic data, historical records, and economic history scholarship to
describe how labor abundance or scarcity influenced governance and institutions. Finally, it analyzes these
findings through the lens of Acemoglu and Robinson’s Why Nations Fail  framework – particularly the notions
of extractive versus inclusive institutions, labor bargaining power , and responses to demographic shocks –
to assess how Chinese history supports or challenges their model.
China’s Population and Labor in Context:  For most of recorded history, China has been the world’s most
populous nation. As early as 2 CE during the Han Dynasty, China’s population was around 60 million  people
(approximately  one-quarter  of  the  world’s  population  at  that  time).  For  the  next  millennium,  dynastic
population totals fluctuated between roughly 37 and 60 million, with growth often checked by wars and
crises. After 1000 CE, especially during the late imperial period (Ming and Qing dynasties), population
growth accelerated dramatically. The introduction of New World crops like maize and sweet potatoes in the
16th–17th centuries allowed cultivation of marginal lands and supported a population boom . Qing China’s
population roughly doubled from about  177 million in 1749 to 358 million by 1811 , and reached an
estimated  430 million by 1850 . The chart below illustrates China’s long-term population growth, which
remained relatively flat for centuries before a steep rise in the Qing and a further explosion in the 20th
century.
Chart of China’s population growth throughout history. China’s populace grew slowly until the late imperial period,
then surged in the Qing dynasty (18th–19th centuries) and again in the modern era. Periodic drops coincide with
wars, rebellions, and famines (e.g. 17th century collapse of Ming, mid-19th century Taiping Rebellion, and the
Great Leap Forward famine). This historical demographic trend underpins shifts in labor availability and state
policies.

This demographic backdrop is crucial for understanding labor’s role in Chinese political economy. In times
of population abundance , labor was cheap and readily replaceable from the state’s perspective – an input
to be leveraged intensively. Emperors and governments could embark on massive projects or sustain large
armies, confident that manpower could be replenished by high birth rates. Conversely, in periods of labor
scarcity  (whether regional, due to war and depopulation, or national, due to low fertility), the value of each
worker  rose,  sometimes  forcing  the  state  to  adjust  by  offering  incentives  or  instituting  reforms.  The
following sections chronicle this evolving dynamic era by era, tracing how the Chinese state’s treatment of
labor  oscillated  between  extractive  exploitation  and,  occasionally,  more  inclusive  or  incentivizing
approaches when circumstances required.
Imperial Era: Labor as the Foundation of Dynastic Power (221 BCE –
1911 CE)
Throughout China’s imperial era (from the Qin unification in 221 BCE to the fall of the Qing in 1911), the
agrarian economy meant the vast majority of the population were rural peasants. Labor was the primary
resource  underpinning state power – producing food, paying taxes or grain tribute, and supplying armies
and corvée work teams. Emperors viewed a large population as a sign of prosperity and a strategic asset
(“population is power ”), yet they often wielded that asset in an extractive manner . Abundant peasant labor
allowed rulers to undertake awe-inspiring public works and military campaigns, albeit at great human cost.
At the same time, the state had to manage that population through institutions (land allotment systems,
corvée labor obligations, etc.) to prevent unrest and ensure sufficient productivity. This section examines
key  phases  of  the  imperial  era,  highlighting  how  labor  was  mobilized  and  how  laborers  fared  under
different dynasties.
Early Imperial Period: Qin and Han Dynasties
The Qin Dynasty (221–206 BCE)  inaugurated China’s imperial age with a brutally efficient state that saw its
subjects as units of labor to be organized and exploited for grand state-building projects. Qin Shi Huang,
the First Emperor , famously unified the Warring States and immediately set about imposing heavy burdens
on the populace. Historical accounts describe  mass conscription  for Qin’s ambitious infrastructure and
military  endeavors.  For  example,  to  secure  the  northern  frontier  against  nomadic  incursions,  the  Qin
regime conscripted “ several hundred thousand workers ” to connect and fortify the old walls of former states,
creating the first version of the Great Wall. In addition,  millions of people were dragooned  into huge
construction  projects  –  from  highways  and  canals  to  the  emperor’s  own  mausoleum  guarded  by  the
Terracotta Army – with many dying en route or on the job. The Qin legalist philosophy treated commoners
as state property; every male had obligatory military and labor service, and collective punishment and strict
laws  ensured  compliance.  The  human  toll  was  enormous:  forced  labor ,  heavy  taxes,  and  ruthless
punishments earned Qin Shi Huang a reputation as the “arch tyrant” of Chinese history. Individual lives
were expendable in service of the empire’s glory – a clear example of labor viewed as a fungible resource.
Indeed, popular resentment at these impositions sparked rebellions immediately after the First Emperor’s
death, leading to the dynasty’s collapse in 206 BCE. Qin’s fate illustrated a recurring theme: over-extraction
of labor could spark revolt despite population plenty.
The succeeding Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE)  initially moderated the Qin’s excesses but continued to
rely on labor drafts. Early Han rulers reduced corvée quotas and taxes to rebuild a population devastated by
war , acknowledging that nurturing the peasantry was necessary after Qin’s depredations. Once recovery
2
occurred  (the  Han  census  of  2  CE  recorded  57.7  million  people ,  roughly  a  quarter  of  the  world’s
population), the Han state re-imposed labor obligations albeit in a somewhat more calibrated way. The Han
government required adult men to give a period of annual corvée labor or military service (typically one
month per year of unpaid work on imperial projects), though commutation in cash or cloth was sometimes
allowed in later periods. Major works like the extension of frontier defenses and maintenance of canals
continued to depend on mass labor mobilization. The state also employed convicts and state-owned slaves
in workshops, alongside hired craftsmen. This mix of forced and paid labor suggests that even in the more
“benevolent” Han era, the notion of labor as an obligated resource persisted, tempered by pragmatic
incentives to ensure skilled work. Han rulers and scholars did prize the peasantry as the productive base of
society – Confucian ideology held that “the people are the foundation of the state” – yet the reality was that
commoners were tightly bound to servicing the state through taxes and labor dues. 
Despite these burdens, the Han period generally saw population growth and economic expansion, with
relative stability enabling farmers to feed the population. There were limits to extraction: if natural disasters
or war caused depopulation, the state responded by reducing taxes and labor demands to let the populace
recover . For instance, after a major rebellion or external war , Han authorities sometimes  granted tax
remissions  and  suspended  corvée  in  affected  regions  to  spur  resettlement  and  cultivation  (an  early
recognition that labor was not infinitely replaceable in the short term). In essence, the early imperial state
oscillated between exploiting labor when it was abundant and easing off when labor became scarce due to
upheaval. By the end of Eastern Han (2nd century CE), internal strife (like the Yellow Turban peasant revolt)
and warlordism had again devastated the population – a drop from ~60 million to perhaps 40 million or
less is evidenced in fragmentary records. This demographic collapse set the stage for a period of division,
illustrating  how  overextension  and  failure  to  accommodate  the  welfare  of  laboring  masses  could
undermine a regime’s viability – a lesson future dynasties would re-learn repeatedly.
Medieval and Late Imperial China: Song, Ming, and Qing Dynasties
After centuries of disunity, the Sui (581–618 CE) and Tang (618–907) dynasties restored a strong central
empire. The Sui Dynasty  in particular offers a stark example of an imperial calculus that treated labor as a
renewable resource to be expended for strategic infrastructure – with disastrous consequences. The Sui
emperors  undertook  gigantic  public  works ,  most  notably  the  first  Grand  Canal,  to  link  China’s  river
systems and supply the capital. According to historical estimates, the Grand Canal project alone conscripted
approximately 5 million laborers  under often appalling conditions. Contemporary chronicles and later
historians  note  that  Sui  projects  were  built  by  “masses  of  forced  laborers  working  under  appalling
conditions,” resulting in “terrible suffering”  among the people. By 611 CE, the Sui had completed a vast
network of canals from Hangzhou in the south to near Beijing in the north – an engineering marvel that
indeed facilitated imperial control and economic integration. However , the human cost of this and other Sui
feats (such as rebuilding sections of the Great Wall with huge levies of peasant labor in 607–608) was
immense, and widespread social unrest  was the result. Exhausted and resentful peasant-workers became
fertile ground for rebellion. By the reign of Emperor Yang (r . 604–618), constant military campaigns (e.g.
disastrous invasions of Korea that also swallowed countless lives) and labor conscription provoked uprisings
across the country. The Sui dynasty rapidly collapsed, largely due to popular revolt against overwork and
oppression. In this case, the state’s assumption that it could inexhaustibly draw on peasant labor  proved
false – labor was abundant but not infinitely so, and the breaking point was reached when extraction
outstripped tolerance.
3
The succeeding Tang Dynasty  moderated labor demands by instituting the Equal-Field  system and a milder
corvée tax (the zu-yong-diao  system), wherein peasant households were allocated land in return for a fixed
tax and labor quota. In early Tang, adult males owed 20 days of corvée labor a year (with the possibility of
paying a tax in grain or cloth instead, which many did as monetization increased). This system worked while
Tang was prosperous and population was growing. However , mid-Tang crises – notably the  An Lushan
Rebellion (755–763) , which devastated the north and may have killed up to 13 million people – upset the
labor-land balance. After this rebellion, Tang authorities could no longer accurately track households for
corvée and taxes; the Equal-Field system broke down as many peasants fled or died. In response, the late
Tang state shifted to a new tax system (the  Double Tax ), which taxed households based on property and
allowed commutation of labor into cash payments. The army moved from conscription to professional
soldiers (often mercenaries). These changes marked a decline in formal corvée labor  and an increase in
hired labor and local recruiting – essentially an adaptation to labor scarcity and administrative chaos.
Peasants had relatively more freedom to sell their labor or move, but they also fell under the control of local
landlords and warlords as central authority waned. Thus, by the end of Tang, the bargaining power of
common laborers may have improved slightly in that the state was less able to coerce them directly; yet
exploitation continued in more decentralized forms.
A  long  period  of  population  growth  followed  in  the  Song  Dynasty  (960–1279) .  China’s  population  is
estimated to have doubled from ~50 million in 800 CE to 100+ million by 1100 CE  (Northern Song era). This
era saw thriving commerce, urbanization, and technological innovation. Wage labor became more common
in cities (e.g. in workshops, mining, port work), and the state increasingly relied on monetary taxes  instead
of  physical  labor  service.  The  Song  government  often  hired  contractors  or  paid  laborers  for  projects,
reflecting a more market-based approach in an economy with abundant cash and sophisticated markets.
However , rural peasants were still under heavy rents and taxes; land concentration in elite hands meant
many  farmers  were  effectively  tenants.  Labor  was  abundant  relative  to  land  in  Song  times  –  indeed,
economic  historians  like  Mark  Elvin  have  described  a  “high-level  equilibrium”  in  which  cheap  labor
disincentivized labor-saving innovation in Song China. By one estimate,  Chinese incomes per capita in
1000 AD were as high as or higher than Europe’s , but thereafter China’s growth largely kept pace with
population (remaining at a near stationary per capita level) while Europe’s per capita income began to pull
ahead after 1500. Between 1250 and 1850, China’s population roughly quadrupled, yet per capita output
stayed roughly constant – an indicator that additional labor went into simply producing enough subsistence
for  more  mouths,  rather  than  raising  living  standards.  This  pattern  is  consistent  with  an  extractive
equilibrium  in Acemoglu & Robinson’s terms: elites extracted the surplus from an expanding population
without broad improvements in productivity or income for the masses. Put simply, more people meant
more labor to exploit, rather than a higher value placed on each individual. Only massive external shocks
would alter this equation.
One such shock came with the Mongol conquest (Yuan Dynasty, 1271–1368) , which caused a precipitous
population decline (through warfare, famine, and plague). China’s population fell from an estimated 120
million in the late Song to maybe 60–70 million by the 14th century. The Black Death  and other plagues in
the mid-1300s likely hit China as well, further reducing the labor force. In the ensuing Ming Dynasty (1368–
1644) , the state suddenly found land plentiful and people scarce in some regions – the opposite of late Song
conditions.  Early  Ming  emperors  (notably  the  Hongwu  Emperor)  responded  by  enticing  peasants  to
resettle abandoned lands  with promises of tax exemptions and by  redistributing land  to smallholding
farmers. For example, after the Ming founder drove out the Mongols, an initial census in 1372 found only
~84,000 households in Sichuan  (a region devastated by war). To rebuild, Hongwu initiated large-scale
state-organized migrations to Sichuan and other depopulated areas ( yimin shishi  – “moving people to fill
4
Sichuan”). These settlers were lured with free land grants and multi-year tax holidays . This policy, known
historically as  “Huguang fills Sichuan” , continued into the early Qing era and successfully repopulated
Sichuan by bringing in hundreds of thousands of migrants from Huguang (Hubei and Hunan) and other
provinces. The Qing government in the 1690s similarly offered incentives like oxen, seeds, and 5-6 years
tax exemption  to encourage migrants to reclaim wasted lands . These measures reveal how a scarcity
of  labor  could  force  even  an  autocratic  state  to  adopt  more  inclusive  economic  policies  (at  least
temporarily) to rebuild the population and productivity. Labor , in these instances, was valued more highly;
individuals became something to entice and reward rather than simply requisition.
As the  Qing Dynasty (1644–1911)  progressed, however , population growth returned with a vengeance.
From around 150 million in 1700, China’s population exploded to  300+ million by 1800 and over 430
million by 1850 . Several factors contributed: prolonged internal peace and stability in the 18th century,
expansion of farming into new regions, and new crop varieties (corn, sweet potatoes) that supported higher
yields. The Qing state generally welcomed population growth – more people meant a larger tax base and
more troops. Indeed, Qing emperors often celebrated population increases, and the ideology of the dynasty
emphasized “nourishing the people” on the one hand, though often in service of imperial grandeur on the
other .  With  labor  so  abundant,  wages  remained  low  and  rural  living  standards  for  most  remained  at
subsistence. By the late 18th century, land per capita had shrunk markedly; many peasants were landless or
holding tiny plots, so they increasingly relied on handicraft sideline work or seasonal migration for income.
In effect,  labor oversupply  reduced any bargaining power peasants or workers might have had – if one
laborer would not accept low pay or onerous conditions, there were plenty of others desperate enough to
take his place.
This  era  exemplified  what  economists  call  a  Malthusian  trap :  any  economic  gains  were  absorbed  by
population increase, keeping most people at bare survival level. As one analysis summarizes, from the 13th
to 19th centuries China saw a fourfold rise in population while per capita income stayed roughly flat, thanks
to  improved  food  production  techniques  that  fed  more  people  without  fundamentally  increasing
productivity. The Qing state’s attitude toward labor in this context remained fundamentally extractive. It
levied a head tax (the ding  tax) on adult males (though after 1712 this was merged with land tax), and it
continued the practice of periodic corvée  (largely commuted to monetary fees by this time). Peasants also
effectively owed labor to local elites or lineage organizations, as land became concentrated (despite Qing
legal protections for smallholders, the rich often found ways around them). Major state projects like river
dredging, dike building, and palace construction drew on compulsory labor or low-paid hired workers. Even
large-scale private enterprises, such as mineral mining or transport guilds, operated under conditions of
labor surplus where employers held most of the power . 
The downside of treating human lives as an indefinitely renewable resource became painfully clear in the
19th century , when a combination of factors led to catastrophe. The population had overshot the carrying
capacity of available farmland, and when governance faltered (under fiscal strain, corruption, Western
pressures, etc.), the countryside was primed for unrest. The Taiping Rebellion (1851–1864)  – a massive civil
war – and other uprisings decimated the population by an estimated 20–30 million deaths . Whole regions
were laid waste; for instance, central China’s Yangtze provinces lost millions and  some areas did not
recover their pre-1850 population until the mid-20th century . From the peak of ~430 million in 1850,
China’s population stagnated or even fell for several decades. By 1880 it may have been closer to 350–370
million, slowly climbing back to around 400 million by the turn of the 20th century. Thus, between 1850 and
1950, China’s population grew by only about 100 million (from ~432 million to ~532 million)  – a striking
contrast to the previous century’s explosive growth. This “lost century” of slow population growth was due1
5
to the combined ravages of rebellion, foreign invasion, famine (e.g. the Northern Chinese Famine of 1876–
79), and disease. In this period of relative labor scarcity (at least compared to the land and resource base),
one might expect workers to gain leverage. Indeed, in some regions after the Taiping war , survivors could
demand better tenancy terms or higher wages because land was plentiful and labor was short. Qing
authorities,  desperate  to  restore  order  and  production,  reduced  taxes,  distributed  relief,  and  even
sponsored migrations  to refill devastated zones (as noted, Sichuan and other provinces were targets of
resettlement policies in the late 19th century as well) . These actions acknowledge that when people
became fewer , the state had to  value each person more  – a rare moment in imperial history when the
commoner’s importance rose in the state’s eyes. 
Overall,  however ,  the  late  Qing  did  not  fundamentally  shift  to  “inclusive”  institutions;  once  population
pressures resumed by the early 20th century, the old patterns of exploitation continued. By the end of the
imperial era in 1911, China’s people had endured cycles of being treated as an abundant resource to be
spent and, in crisis times, as a resource to be protected just enough to enable recovery. The imperial social
contract rarely empowered laborers in any formal sense – there were no independent guilds or unions with
clout vis-à-vis the state (though merchant guilds and secret societies at times bargained locally). Peasant
rebellions  remained  the  crude  instrument  of  labor’s  bargaining  power ,  erupting  when  misery  and
oppression peaked. The imperial dynasty cycle itself – rise, population growth, administrative overstretch,
peasant revolt, dynasty fall – can be interpreted as a function of labor exploitation and demographic swings.
As we will analyze later , this reflects a largely extractive institutional order  in Acemoglu and Robinson’s
terminology, albeit one periodically interrupted by shock-induced reforms or resets. 
Republican Era (1912–1949): Industrialization, Upheaval, and the
First Labor Movements
The collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911 ushered in the Republican era, a time of warlordism, Japanese
invasion, and civil war . Demographically, China in 1912 still had over 400 million people, mostly peasants
living in roughly the same conditions as under late Qing landlords and local strongmen. The early 20th
century brought attempts at industrialization in select urban centers, creating a nascent urban working
class whose experience was markedly different from the rural peasantry. For the first time,  urban labor
movements  and  ideas  of  workers’  rights  entered  the  Chinese  scene,  influenced  by  global  trends  in
socialism and trade unionism. However , the turmoil of the period often made human life exceedingly cheap:
warlords conscripted peasants at will, and war and famine killed millions (e.g. the 1928–30 warlord wars,
the 1937–45 Sino-Japanese War , and the devastating Henan famine of 1942). The state (fragmented among
competing regimes) had limited capacity to protect or value individual laborers; instead, common people
were frequently seen as cannon fodder or forced labor by whichever authority held sway in their area.
In the  1920s , under the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek and the influence of the Soviet-allied
Communist  Party  (before  their  split  in  1927),  China  saw  the  first  significant  urban  labor  strikes  and
unions . Workers in factories, docks, and railways – especially in treaty port cities like Shanghai, Guangzhou,
and Hong Kong – organized to demand better wages and conditions. Notably, the 1925–1927 period saw
major strikes such as those by Shanghai’s textile and dock workers and the Canton-Hong Kong general
strike. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), founded in 1921, initially focused on organizing industrial
workers and succeeded in briefly mobilizing a labor movement. These events suggested a rising labor
consciousness: unlike in imperial times, some workers attempted to assert collective bargaining power . For
example, in 1925 a strike and boycott in Shanghai’s Japanese-owned mills won wage increases, and in 19221
6
seamen in Hong Kong struck for higher pay. However , this embryonic labor empowerment was violently
curtailed. After 1927, Chiang Kai-shek’s regime suppressed Communist-led unions (the Shanghai Massacre
of 1927 saw hundreds of pro-labor activists killed). Under the Nationalist government in the Nanjing decade
(1928–1937), independent labor unions were banned or co-opted, and strikes were often crushed. Thus,
whatever bargaining power urban workers attempted to exercise was short-lived, as the state (now under a
nationalist, capitalist-oriented elite) sided firmly with industrialists and landlords to maintain an extractive
status quo.
In the countryside during the Republic, conditions arguably worsened in many areas. Warlords during the
1910s–20s extracted whatever resources they could to fund their armies, including grain and labor from
peasants, with little central oversight. Peasants remained tied to land controlled by landlords or warlord
militias; rents were high and lawlessness pervasive. There were scattered peasant movements (the CCP in
its early years also organized peasant associations in rural areas of Hunan and Jiangxi, for instance), but
these were met with brutal repression by local elites. Demographic growth was slow: from about 400 million
in 1911, China’s population may have reached ~450 million by the late 1930s. The modest increase masks
enormous mortality from conflict – the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–45) and World War II caused an
estimated  14–20  million  Chinese  deaths  (military  and  civilian).  In  occupied  areas,  the  Japanese  army
infamously  used  forced  Chinese  labor  for  construction  and  mining  (and  even  enslaved  laborers  sent
abroad). The overall dynamic of the Republican war years was that human life was expendable: whether
under Nationalist scorched-earth tactics (as seen in the 1938 breaching of the Yellow River dikes to stop the
Japanese,  which  flooded  and  killed  hundreds  of  thousands  of  peasants)  or  Japanese  exploitation,  the
mentality was that China’s big population could absorb horrific losses. One chilling example: Chiang Kai-
shek  purportedly  remarked  that  China  could  ultimately  prevail  against  Japan  because  even  if  Chinese
casualties were in the tens of millions, there would still be hundreds of millions left – a grim echo of the
notion of people as a renewable resource.
By the end of the civil war in 1949, when the Communists took power , China’s population stood around 540–
550 million . The long period of anarchy and war had kept population growth in check (an increase of only
~100 million over a century, as noted), and had also hardened attitudes about labor . Both Nationalists and
Communists recruited millions of peasants into their armies with minimal training or equipment, often
relying on sheer numbers to overwhelm the enemy. This foreshadowed the Communist approach in the
coming  decades:  a  willingness  to  mobilize  masses  for  combat  or  production,  on  the  premise  that
manpower was China’s one abundant asset  even in the face of material shortages.
Yet,  the  CCP  also  carried  an  ideological  commitment  to  uplifting  the  laboring  classes  –  “workers  and
peasants” were lionized as the masters of the new society in rhetoric. In practice, upon victory the CCP
regime would attempt a grand social experiment: to harness China’s labor power under a centrally planned
economy, ostensibly for the people’s benefit, but in ways that often reprised the extractive utilization of
human effort seen under past regimes. The major difference was that labor was now mobilized not by local
landlords or capitalists, but by the state itself claiming to act in workers’ interests. The actual experience of
workers and peasants under Mao would be mixed, as the next section explores. 
7
Maoist Era (1949–1976): Mass Mobilization and the Value (or
Expendability) of Lives
When the People’s Republic of China was established in 1949, the new government faced the task of
rebuilding a shattered economy. Mao Zedong and the Communist Party believed in the power of human
labor as the engine of development – consistent with Marxist ideas valuing the proletariat, but also in line
with  a  long  Chinese  tradition  of  labor-intensive  solutions .  Mao  famously  declared  that  China’s  huge
population was an asset: “ I’m not afraid of nuclear war... China has a population of 600 million; even if half of
them are killed, there are still 300 million people left ”. This startling statement (made in 1957 to a shocked
Soviet delegation) encapsulates the Maoist leadership’s view that China’s population advantage made it
uniquely resilient and able to absorb sacrifices. It also chillingly equated human lives with statistics – a
continuum  of  the  imperial-era  notion  of  people  as  fungible  resources,  now  couched  in  revolutionary
bravado. 
In  the  Maoist  period,  labor  was  organized  in  fundamentally  new  ways.  The  state  eliminated  private
ownership of land and most private businesses by the 1950s, bringing both rural and urban labor under
direct  or  indirect  state  control.  Rural  peasants  were  first  coerced  into  mutual  aid  teams,  then  into
cooperatives, and finally into large People’s Communes  by 1958. These communes, averaging 20–30,000
people, pooled labor for farming and local industries, effectively making rural labor allocation a function of
government planning rather than household decision-making.  Urban workers  were employed in state-
owned enterprises (SOEs) or collectively owned factories, and enjoyed an “iron rice bowl” – a cradle-to-grave
secured employment system, albeit at relatively low wages. The state determined production targets and
job assignments, aiming for rapid industrialization. In both city and countryside, the regime attempted to
maximize output by mobilizing labor en masse and instilling a high degree of discipline and ideological zeal.
The  official  narrative  valued  workers  and  peasants  (“labor  heroes”  were  celebrated),  but  in  practice
individual choice was minimal – the state decided where and how one’s labor would be used.
Two signature policies illustrate the extremes of Maoist labor mobilization: the  Great Leap Forward  and
the hukou system  of household registration. 
The Great Leap Forward (1958–1961)  was an economic campaign to fast-track China’s leap into a
communist utopia by harnessing sheer manpower . Mao believed that by mobilizing China’s hundreds
of millions of peasants, the nation could “overtake Britain and America” in industrial output without
waiting for capital accumulation. The strategy was explicitly  labor-intensive rather than capital-
intensive , seeking to “emphasize manpower rather than machines and capital” . Villages were
urged to set up “backyard steel furnaces” and produce iron in primitive smelters, while agricultural
labor was organized into shock-brigades working in newly formed communes . Huge projects
like dam construction, irrigation works, and land reclamation were undertaken by mass labor with
minimal equipment – essentially recreating the model of ancient conscript labor but under socialist
slogans. During the Great Leap, private farming was banned; communal mess halls were created so
that peasants could supposedly focus all their energy on collective production. In rhetoric, “people’s
communes are great!”; in reality, traditional incentives and checks disappeared. Initially, outputs
were exaggerated, and local cadres forced peasants to hand over excessive grain, believing in false
bumper harvests. Soon, grain production collapsed , but the state continued food procurements to
feed  urban  areas  and  export  some  grain.  The  result  was  one  of  history’s  worst  famines:  it  is
estimated that 20 to 30 million Chinese died of starvation between 1959 and 1962 . The Great•

Leap Forward showcased the tragic flaw in treating human labor as the solution to all problems – no
amount of coerced manpower could compensate for poor policy and lack of technical know-how.
Moreover , it revealed a shocking willingness of the leadership to tolerate mass death  in pursuit of
ambitious targets. Mao never publicly admitted the famine toll, and in the aftermath he even blamed
sparrows and bad weather , rather than the systemic over-extraction of peasant livelihood. Only in
1962 did the government retreat, disbanding many communes, restoring private garden plots, and
allowing  peasants  to  recover .  The  Great  Leap’s  failure  underscored  that  labor ,  no  matter  how
abundant, has its limits and that extreme extraction can be horribly counterproductive. It stands as a
stark example of an  extractive policy (in A&R’s sense) taken to its extreme , where the state’s
attempt  to  squeeze  maximum  output  from  peasants  led  to  economic  collapse  and  human
catastrophe.
The Hukou System , introduced in 1958, was a mechanism of social control that tied Chinese people
to their place of birth ( hukou  means household registration). Under this system, every individual was
classified as either “agricultural (rural) hukou” or “non-agricultural (urban) hukou,” and mobility was
strictly regulated. The hukou regime was initially designed to serve Maoist economic strategy: it
aimed to prevent mass rural-to-urban migration  so that cities would not be overwhelmed and so
that the countryside could remain self-sufficient in food. Urban areas were privileged with state
investment, ration cards, jobs for those with urban hukou, and access to education, healthcare, and
housing,  whereas  rural  dwellers  were  largely  excluded  from  these  benefits.  Essentially,  hukou
created a two-tier citizenship that  institutionalized labor apartheid : urban workers held secure
jobs and welfare (forming an elite proletariat in the state’s eyes), while rural peasants were expected
to feed themselves and supply grain to the state, with minimal support. For the peasants, hukou
meant one’s labor was literally bound to the commune – leaving to seek non-approved work in a city
was illegal and could result in denial of food rations since everything was tied to registration. This
system allowed the state to  extract agricultural surplus at low cost  (since peasants had to sell
grain to the state at low fixed prices and had no option to leave and find better-paid work). In effect,
rural labor was made fungible  and immobile , a captive workforce for grain and raw materials. One
scholar noted that by the 2000s, the legacy of hukou still held hundreds of millions in villages “where
they are not exploiting their earning potential” because moving remained difficult. Under Mao, the
immediate effect was to lock peasants in place during the famine – tragically, many starving villagers
could not legally flee to cities where food supplies were better . Hukou thus exemplifies a deeply
extractive institution : it ensured cheap grain and labor for the state at the expense of rural living
standards, by enforcing a dual structure  that valued urban industrial labor over rural farm labor .
Despite these draconian policies, the Mao era did witness some improvements for ordinary Chinese in
certain respects, especially in the early 1950s: land reform broke the power of landlord elites and gave land
to  peasants  (briefly  increasing  their  autonomy  until  collectivization),  and  public  health  campaigns,
education drives, and social equality measures raised the quality of life for many. However , these gains were
uneven and often reversed by later campaigns. By the late Mao period (1970s), life expectancy had risen
and basic literacy spread – indicators that the state’s investment in human capital was not negligible. But
the fundamental approach to labor remained one of mobilization and control . The state assumed it could
direct human effort to any task, whether building a dam with shovels or sending “educated youth” to till
remote lands during the Cultural Revolution. Labor was idolized in propaganda (“劳动最光荣” – labor is most
glorious), yet laborers themselves had little personal freedom. • 
9
It is important to note that while the Maoist state was highly extractive of labor , it did so under a collectivist
rubric that differed from earlier private exploitation. For urban workers, the “iron rice bowl” meant that
although wages were low, job security and benefits were high; their labor was controlled but also protected
(a  form  of  state  paternalism).  For  rural  people,  subsistence  was  guaranteed  in  normal  times  by  the
collective (famine being the horrific exception), but upward mobility or exit was impossible. There were no
formal labor markets – jobs were assigned, not chosen or bargained for . Strikes were essentially unheard of
(and illegal) in the PRC until the late 1970s because the Party-state claimed to represent the workers,
leaving no room for independent labor demands. Thus,  labor bargaining power was virtually zero  in
Maoist China: all negotiations happened within the Party hierarchy, not between workers and management.
When discontent did occur (as during some local unrest in the famine or isolated worker protests in 1967), it
was usually suppressed or co-opted by the political campaigns of the moment.
In  summary,  the  Mao  era  continued  the  historical  pattern  of  viewing  China’s  giant  population  as  an
instrument of policy – perhaps even more intensively than imperial regimes, since the Communist ideology
explicitly sought to  “organize China’s vast population… to meet the country’s… problems” . The
difference was that this was justified as being “for the people” rather than for an emperor . Nonetheless,
episodes like the Great Leap Forward reveal that individual lives were still tragically expendable in the eyes
of leaders pursuing grand visions. By 1976, on the eve of Reform, China’s population had grown to about
940 million  (despite the famine losses) , and the country had achieved a basic industrial base but at the
cost of great human sacrifice and economic inefficiency. The question looming for the post-Mao leadership
was how to feed, employ, and improve the lot of this enormous population without repeating the disasters
of over-mobilization. The answer they chose – market-oriented reform – would fundamentally alter the role
of labor in the Chinese economy and the state’s approach to population.
Reform and Opening Era (1978–2000s): Market Reforms, Migration,
and the “Surplus Labor” Advantage
Deng Xiaoping’s rise to power in 1978 marked a turning point in China’s political economy. The new slogan
became “let some people get rich first” , and pragmatism replaced ideology. For labor , this era would bring
liberalization  in some respects (the end of collective farming, the emergence of private employment and
labor markets) but also new forms of exploitation (notably of rural migrant workers under the still-extant
hukou regime). The state’s view of labor shifted: rather than simply mobilizing labor for quota fulfillment,
the emphasis moved to increasing productivity and efficiency by unleashing market incentives. However , a
key pillar of China’s growth strategy was to capitalize on its  huge, underemployed rural population  –
effectively  treating  the  countryside  as  a  reservoir  of  cheap  labor  for  industrialization.  In  development
economics terms, China in the 1980s and 1990s followed the  Lewis model  of a “dual economy,” where
surplus rural labor migrates to fuel urban industrial growth at low wages, until that surplus is absorbed and
wages start to rise. 
The first major reform was in the countryside: the  Household Responsibility System , adopted starting
1979–1981, broke up the People’s Communes and allowed farm families to work their own land and sell
excess produce after meeting state quotas. This dramatically boosted agricultural productivity and freed up
rural labor  – millions of peasants suddenly had time and incentive to seek non-farm activities once they
could meet grain quotas with much less labor input than under the commune system. Township and Village
Enterprises (TVEs) sprouted, employing rural labor in local industry. Meanwhile, the state began permitting2
5
10
and even encouraging peasants to migrate to urban areas for work, especially to the new Special Economic
Zones (like Shenzhen) and coastal cities that were opening to foreign investment. 
However , the hukou system was not dismantled ; instead, it was modified to allow temporary migration.
Rural workers could obtain temporary residence permits to work in cities, but they  remained officially
rural hukou holders , meaning they had no claim to urban public services (schools, healthcare, housing
subsidies) and were excluded from the “iron rice bowl” entitlements of state workers. This created the
phenomenon of the “ migrant worker ” (农民工) – a massive labor force of peasants-turned-proletarians who
powered China’s factories and construction sites from the 1980s onward, but who were treated as second-
class citizens in the cities. Employers eagerly hired migrants because they could pay them much lower
wages  than  formal  urban  employees  and  offer  scant  benefits,  knowing  these  workers  had  little  legal
recourse or alternative. Indeed, studies found that rural migrants in cities earned on average 40% less
than urban hukou workers in similar jobs in the 2000s, with only a small minority receiving any
employment  benefits .  They  were  often  concentrated  in  the  most  dangerous  and  menial  jobs,  facing
discrimination  and  exploitation.  For  a  long  time,  migrant  labor  could  be  exploited  “without  legal
repercussion,”  as one analysis notes, because labor laws were poorly enforced for this group and migrants
had no bargaining power . Essentially, the hukou system allowed China to have the best of both worlds
economically: a stable, relatively privileged core urban workforce and a vast underprivileged underclass of
migrants  who  kept  labor  costs  ultra-competitive.  One  estimate  from  the  1990s  calculated  that  when
considering the lack of social benefits and lower wages, the cost of rural migrant labor was only about 44%
of the cost of regular urban labor . This huge cost advantage attracted foreign investors and drove the
export manufacturing boom  in coastal provinces.
The 1980s–90s were thus characterized by a massive transfer of labor from agriculture to industry and
services .  By  2000,  roughly  150  million  rural  Chinese  had  migrated  to  cities  or  towns  for  work.  This
migration  –  though  often  temporary  or  circulatory  –  represented  the  largest  peacetime  movement  of
people  in  human  history.  It  provided  what  economists  call  a  “demographic  dividend”:  an  expanding
working-age population and a vast “surplus labor” pool  that kept wages low and profits high. During this
period, Chinese officials openly touted the country’s labor abundance as a comparative advantage. In the
1990s, as globalization accelerated, China became known as the “world’s factory,” largely on the back of its
cheap  labor .  Many  economists  argued  that  China’s  large  population  was  its  biggest  economic
strength , allowing rapid growth by moving tens of millions from low-productivity farm work to higher-
productivity  factory  work.  This  labor  migration  contributed  substantially  to  China’s  extraordinary  GDP
growth (often 8–10% annually). Productivity surged not necessarily from cutting-edge technology, but from
reallocating labor to more productive uses and from intense work effort under disciplined factory regimes.
From the state’s perspective, individual workers were still somewhat interchangeable – especially migrants
from rural areas. If one worker quit or complained, another was ready to take their place. Labor protections
were minimal in the 1980s–90s for the non-state sector . Workplace accidents, wage arrears, and excessive
overtime were common. For instance, surveys in the late 1990s found nearly half of migrant workers had
experienced non-payment of wages for months . Independent unions were (and remain) illegal; the only
official union is the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which is government-run and generally does not
engage in collective bargaining. Wildcat strikes and protests did occur (and increased in the late 1990s as
SOE layoffs began and sweatshop conditions fueled worker anger), but these were usually localized and
often  suppressed  or  mediated  quietly  by  authorities.  Thus,  labor’s  bargaining  power  remained  low ,
though not absolute zero – by the 2000s, some migrant workers began to successfully strike for better pay
at foreign-owned factories, and the government, concerned about instability, passed new labor laws in 20086
11
to improve contracts and wages. But during most of the Reform era’s first two decades, the tacit social
contract was that workers would accept hard conditions in exchange for the promise of a better future and
the ability to send money home, while the state prioritized growth over labor rights.
It’s important to highlight that even as the exploitation of labor continued in new forms, the Reform era saw
overall living standards improve markedly . The shift to a market-mixed economy unleashed productivity;
hundreds of millions were lifted out of dire poverty. Real wages for migrant labor , while low, were still
higher than what subsistence farming would have yielded, which is why so many chose to migrate. Urban
state-sector workers in the 1980s initially enjoyed stable jobs and slowly rising wages, though in the 1990s
many faced layoffs as SOEs restructured or closed (around 30–40 million state workers were laid off in the
late ’90s). Those layoffs did challenge the regime’s relationship with the urban working class – but the
availability of private and informal jobs often absorbed the laid-off workers, again due to the vibrant
economy.
By the early 2000s, China had clearly reached what development economists call the “Lewis turning point”
– the point at which surplus labor from agriculture is largely depleted, and industrial wages begin to rise
more rapidly. Research based on wage data shows that from about 2003 onward, real wages in China’s
coastal manufacturing started rising consistently, even during slack seasons  – a strong sign that the
era of unlimited cheap labor was ending. One study found  accelerating wage increases after 2003 ,
indicating that the surplus labor pool was drying up and employers had to compete for workers. Indeed, by
the 2010s, factories in some regions reported labor shortages or had to offer higher pay and perks to
attract young workers. This turning point was a critical shift: it meant that individual workers’ value was
going up in the market. For the first time, significant numbers of migrant laborers could “shop around” for
better jobs or demand higher pay without being immediately replaced. Some experts pinpoint 2010 as the
moment China definitively passed the Lewis point, after which double-digit annual wage growth for low-
skilled jobs became common. This had far-reaching implications for the Chinese state’s approach to labor
and population, as discussed in the next section.
Before moving on, it’s worth noting how population policy  intersected with labor in the Reform era. In a
dramatic reversal from Mao’s pro-natalist stance (“more people, more power”), the Chinese government in
1980 implemented the One-Child Policy  to curb population growth. By the late 1970s, leaders were worried
that continued rapid population increase (China’s population had reached about 975 million by 1979) would
undermine economic gains. The One-Child Policy, enforced through incentives and often coercive measures
(fines, workplace discipline, forced sterilizations/abortions in cases), succeeded in sharply reducing fertility.
China’s total fertility rate fell from 5.8 births per woman in 1970 to around 2.1 by the 1980s and down
to ~1.5 by the early 2010s . This policy no doubt averted hundreds of millions of births. In the short term, it
likely boosted economic growth by reducing dependency ratios (fewer children to care for per working
adult) and channeled more women into the workforce. China’s working-age population (15-64) swelled and
the dependency ratio  (non-working young and old vs. working) improved through the 1990s and 2000s –
another key component of the “demographic dividend.” However , the long-term consequences  began to
loom:  by  drastically  curbing  birth  rates,  China  set  itself  on  a  path  to  rapid  aging  and  even  potential
population shrinkage. In other words, the abundant labor that had underpinned China’s economic miracle
was not going to last indefinitely. This was well-understood by the 2000s, and the state slowly began to
acknowledge the need to adjust. In 2015, the One-Child Policy was officially ended, allowing all families to
have two children (and later , in 2021, up to three children) in an attempt to stave off a population decline.
12
Thus, by the turn of the millennium, China stood at a crossroads. It had transformed labor into a market
commodity to an unprecedented degree – hundreds of millions now freely (if under hardship) sold their
labor in capitalist enterprises, something unthinkable under Mao. Labor productivity and wages were rising,
signaling maturation of the economy. But these very successes brought new challenges: labor scarcity in
some sectors, a rapidly aging populace , and the need for more skilled rather than purely abundant labor .
The Chinese state now had to rethink the “labor is inexhaustible” mindset that had prevailed for centuries.
In the following section, we examine the contemporary period (2010s–2020s) where these issues come to
the fore, and discuss how the valuation of individual lives and labor has evolved as China’s demographic
context shifts from surplus to potential shortfall.
Contemporary Period (2010s–Present): Demographic Slowdown,
Labor Value, and Policy Shifts
Entering the 21st century, China reached a historic inflection in its demographic and labor profile. After
decades as the quintessential  labor-rich, capital-scarce economy , China is rapidly becoming an  aging,
capital-rich economy with a shrinking workforce . This transition is altering how both society and the
state value human labor and individual lives. Key features of the contemporary period include: the peaking
and now slight decline of total population; a shrinking youth cohort and workforce; rising labor costs and
improved worker rights (at least on paper); and government policies scrambling to adapt, such as loosening
hukou  restrictions,  ending  birth  quotas,  and  promoting  higher  productivity  through  automation  and
education. We will explore each of these developments and their implications for labor’s role.
Demographic Shifts:  In 2020, China’s population reached about  1.41 billion , seemingly its all-time peak
. By 2022, official data indicated the first year of net population decline in six decades (the first since the
Great Leap Forward famine). The one-child generations are now entering the workforce, meaning each
successive cohort of young workers is smaller than the last. The  working-age population  (ages 15-64)
actually began to decline around 2015. At the same time, life expectancy has risen to ~77 years, and the
population over age 65 has grown dramatically  – from 49 million (4.9%) in 1982 to over 150 million
(10.8%) by 2016, and it’s projected to reach 300+ million (over 20% of the population) by the 2030s. This
portends  a  heavy  burden  on  the  working  population  to  support  retirees  (the  so-called  “4-2-1”  family
structure: one child supporting two parents and four grandparents). In short, China is on the verge of the
same demographic challenges that have plagued Japan and parts of Europe – but at a much lower level of
per capita income to cushion the impact.
These changes have already begun to  alter the state’s calculus  regarding population and labor . Where
once the worry was having too many people to feed and employ, now the concern is too few  young people
to drive growth and innovation. An internal reversal is palpable: “in contrast to the government’s original fears
(of overpopulation), a shrinking population may present more problems for China than too much population
growth” . The realization is that China’s economic success was in part built on demographic momentum, and
as that fades, new strategies are needed. The government has thus shifted from limiting births to actively
encouraging them (though without much success so far). The One-Child Policy was replaced by a Two-Child
Policy in 2015, and by 2021 even three children were allowed, accompanied by propaganda urging families
to  have  more  kids.  Authorities  are  introducing  modest  incentives:  longer  maternity  leaves,  childcare
subsidies in some cities, and discouraging abortions for non-medical reasons. But deep social factors (high
education costs, housing expenses, changing family preferences) keep fertility low – in 2021 China’s fertility
rate was around 1.3, far below replacement.7
13
Labor Market Changes:  On the labor front, the era of surplus labor is definitively over , at least in coastal
China. Labor shortages in manufacturing hubs became seasonal norms by the 2010s. The government,
while never abandoning hukou completely, has gradually relaxed it – especially in small and medium cities –
to encourage urbanization and domestic consumption. For example, many cities have lowered the bar for
migrants (especially skilled ones) to obtain urban residency; some provinces have abolished distinctions
between urban and rural hukou. This is partly to integrate migrants  so they will settle and spend wages
locally, and partly a response to the fact that many migrants were increasingly not returning to farming
anyway. The leadership recognizes that continuing to shackle labor mobility would be self-defeating when
the country needs every worker it can get to sustain growth. In 2019, Premier Li Keqiang announced moves
to  grant  urban  residency  to  about  100  million  migrants,  and  policies  like  the  National  New-type
Urbanization  Plan  (2014–2020)  aimed  to  incrementally  reduce  the  urban-rural  welfare  gap.  Still,
fundamental hukou reform is slow – it “entails breaking down China’s current dualistic structure… and
universalizing social services… enjoyed by only about one third of the population,”  which is a costly
and politically fraught endeavor . The inertia of the system means migrants’ children still often lack urban
education access, etc. But the trajectory is toward gradually treating labor more equally, born of necessity: if
migrant workers are no longer abundant, they must be  attracted  and  retained , not just exploited and
discarded.
Alongside these institutional shifts, labor laws and protections have improved  compared to the free-for-
all of the 1990s. A notable change was the 2008 Labor Contract Law that required employers to provide
written  contracts,  set  standards  for  severance  pay,  and  aimed  to  curb  abuses.  Enforcement  remains
inconsistent,  but  many  companies  did  start  offering  better  wages  and  some  benefits  to  avoid  losing
workers. The 2010 wave of strikes in factories (including a high-profile Honda auto parts plant strike that
ended with a 24% wage increase for workers) signaled that workers – especially the younger , savvier
generation of migrants – were more willing to assert themselves. The state’s response was interestingly
ambivalent: while independent unions are still banned, media at the time (even state media) acknowledged
that wage increases were “overdue” and necessary. Provinces raised minimum wages repeatedly in the
2010s (often by 10-20% per year). All of this contributed to an average annual real wage growth of 10%+ for
Chinese manufacturing workers through much of the 2010s – something virtually unprecedented globally.
By one estimate, Chinese unit labor costs (wages adjusted for productivity) roughly doubled in the decade
2005-2015.  As  a  result,  some  labor-intensive  industries  (textiles,  cheap  electronics  assembly)  began
offshoring  from  China  to  cheaper  countries  like  Vietnam  or  Bangladesh.  In  line  with  this,  Chinese
policymakers started talking about moving “up the value chain” – relying less on plentiful cheap hands, and
more on skilled labor and automation.
Valuation of Individual Lives:  With higher wages and improved standards of living, the social value of an
individual life  in China has certainly risen in a tangible sense. Families, particularly those who grew up
under the one-child regime, invest heavily in their single children (“little emperors”), reflecting a shift from
quantity  of  children  to  quality.  The  government  now  uses  language  in  policy  documents  emphasizing
“human capital” and “talent” – acknowledging that future development rests on better educated, more
productive  individuals,  not  just  sheer  numbers.  For  instance,  China  has  massively  expanded  higher
education enrollment since 2000, producing millions of college graduates each year . This is partly to avoid a
demographic wall by increasing productivity per worker . In public health and safety, there is more sensitivity
than in the past; for example, scandals that reveal callous disregard for life (like industrial accidents or the
Covid-19 initial cover-up) draw widespread outrage, suggesting that people expect the state and companies
to value lives more than before. That said, in many areas China still has a long way to go – workplace safety
is  still  lax  (thousands  die  in  coal  mines  and  construction  annually),  and  during  Covid,  while  China
14
aggressively sought to save lives via “zero-Covid” for a time, it also demonstrated draconian control over
individuals to achieve a collective health goal, illustrating the enduring primacy of the state’s objectives over
personal freedoms.
Another axis where the value of individuals is tested is the elderly . As the population greys, each worker’s
life is not only an economic unit but also a support for aging relatives. The government is slowly expanding
pension coverage and health insurance, but the family still bears the brunt. In rural areas, the loss of young
labor to cities has left many villages full of the old and children. The state has launched poverty alleviation
and rural revitalization campaigns to care for those left behind. Implicitly, this is a recognition that people
cannot be treated as infinitely mobile, context-less labor units – they have families and communities that
require support if the labor system is to be sustainable.
Fertility Policy and Labor Force:  Realizing that the workforce will shrink, the Chinese state has become
almost pro-life  in the sense of wanting more babies. The abandonment of the One-Child Policy came with
admissions that the policy overshot and that an aging, declining population could harm the economy.
However , lifting birth restrictions has not led to a baby boom; births remain low because of structural
factors  (high  cost  of  living,  career  considerations,  etc.).  This  has  led  to  discussions  of  more  radical
incentives:  cash  bonuses  for  births,  tax  breaks,  subsidized  childcare,  and  even  proposals  for  state-
sponsored  IVF  or  encouraging  immigration  (still  a  tough  sell  in  China).  The  very  fact  that  Chinese
policymakers are considering such measures is striking – it signifies an inversion of the “population burden”
narrative to a “population asset” narrative once more, but this time focusing on quality and sustainability  of
the labor force. Unlike in Mao’s day when leaders boasted about not fearing the death of millions, today’s
leaders are more likely to worry that each lost or unborn citizen is a lost contribution to China’s future . 
In sum, contemporary China is at a juncture where labor is no longer a super-abundant commodity  but a
somewhat scarcer resource that needs to be allocated more efficiently and nurtured. The government’s
policies – from hukou reform to pro-natal measures – reflect an increased appreciation for the  value of
human capital . Yet, elements of the old attitude linger , especially in authoritarian controls: individuals are
still  expected  to  conform  and  sacrifice  for  collective  goals  (as  seen  in  harsh  lockdowns  or  continued
suppression of independent labor organizing). The coming decades will test how far China transitions to a
truly  “inclusive” approach to labor  – one where workers have rights, social security, and voice – versus
retaining an extractive approach  under new guises (e.g., high-tech surveillance to maximize productivity,
gig economy labor without protections, etc.).
Having chronicled the long arc from imperial times to today, we can now turn to a theoretical analysis: how
does the Chinese historical experience relate to the framework put forth by Daron Acemoglu and James
Robinson in  Why Nations Fail ? We will examine to what extent China’s story of labor , institutions, and
demography aligns with, extends, or challenges their notions of extractive vs. inclusive institutions, the role
of labor power , and responses to shocks.
Analysis through the Why Nations Fail  Framework: Extractive
Institutions, Labor Power, and Demographic Shocks
Acemoglu  and  Robinson  (A&R)  argue  that  the  fate  of  nations  hinges  on  their  institutions.  “ Inclusive
institutions ” – those that broadly distribute power , uphold the rule of law and property rights, and allow
wide participation in the economy – foster prosperity. “ Extractive institutions ” – those that concentrate
15
power and wealth in the hands of a few and exploit the rest – lead to stagnation or short-lived growth at
best. In this section, we map Chinese historical patterns onto these concepts, particularly focusing on labor
relations and how demographic forces have influenced institutional dynamics. China presents a fascinating
case: on one hand, it had one of the longest-running centralized states in history (which A&R would classify
as politically extractive for most of that time), yet it was often the world’s richest or one of the most
advanced regions in premodern eras. In modern times, China’s authoritarian governance coexists with
dramatic economic growth – a combination that seems to challenge the idea that only inclusive institutions
lead  to  success.  We  will  explore  several  themes:  the  generally  extractive  nature  of  imperial  Chinese
institutions and its consequences; instances where labor scarcity or demographic crises forced “inclusive”
tweaks to the system; the Maoist period as an extreme case of extraction (and its eventual self-correction);
and the Reform era as a partial institutional inclusion (economically) that fueled growth, consistent in some
ways  with  A&R’s  model.  We  will  also  consider  the  current  situation  and  future  prospects,  as  China’s
institutional trajectory may be at a crossroads, testing A&R’s predictions.
Imperial China – Extractive by Design:  By A&R’s definitions, imperial China overwhelmingly featured
extractive political and economic institutions . Politically, power was monopolized by the emperor and a
small elite (whether hereditary nobility in early periods or the scholar-official gentry later under the civil
service exam system). The vast majority of people had no say in governance. Economically, while private
property existed, the state and elite landowners often encroached on peasant rights – through taxes,
corvée, and arbitrary exactions. There were checks (like customary rights, or paternalistic norms requiring
granary  relief  in  famines),  but  these  were  not  binding  constraints  on  elite  power ,  rather  benevolent
practices at times. The ruling class – whether aristocrats, warlords, or mandarins – extracted surplus from
the peasants in the form of rent and tax, typically leaving peasants with subsistence. Innovation and
creative enterprise were not broadly encouraged except when they served state interests, and sometimes
were stifled if seen as threatening (for instance, the Ming ban on large-scale private maritime trade in
certain periods). Commerce and urban craftspeople had periods of flourishing (Song Dynasty notably saw
inclusive economic vibrancy in cities with robust markets), but always under the shadow of state control and
elite dominance. Crucially, Chinese rulers maintained a stranglehold on labor mobility  for long stretches –
through institutions like the baojia  household registration in Qing or the hukou in PRC – preventing the kind
of free labor markets that characterize inclusive economic institutions.
The  consequences  of  this  extractive  setup  align  with  A&R’s  theory  in  several  ways.  China’s  early
technological leadership (e.g. Song inventions like gunpowder , printing, compass) did not translate into an
industrial revolution or sustained per-capita growth, arguably because  extractive institutions failed to
provide  incentives  for  broad  innovation  and  instead  allowed  elites  to  simply  take  more  from  more
people. As noted, from 1250 to 1800, China’s population boomed but living standards stagnated. This is a
textbook outcome of extractive systems: any growth (in total output) was achieved by adding more labor
and land under cultivation, not by increasing productivity per person – and that extra output fed the elite
coffers or supported more population, not improvements in the populace’s welfare. In Why Nations Fail , the
authors indeed discuss late imperial China as a society that fell into technological stagnation under a
centralized bureaucracy that ultimately became resistant to change . One can see the periodic dynastic
collapses  due to peasant rebellions (e.g. end of Sui, end of Yuan with Red Turban rebellion, end of Ming
with Li Zicheng’s rebellion, Taiping Rebellion in late Qing) as a pattern where extractive pressure built up
until it caused an explosive reset – consistent with A&R’s notion that extractive regimes are prone to
instability and conflict, as excluded groups eventually lash out.8
16
However , China’s case also  extends  A&R’s model in some nuanced ways. A&R emphasize the binary of
inclusive vs extractive, but imperial China shows that an extractive regime can endure and even prosper for
long periods by maintaining a certain balance. For example, the Chinese imperial exam system (keju),
introduced in the Sui/Tang and expanded in Song and after , was a mechanism that gave some talented
commoners a path to join the elite. This was not “inclusive” in a democratic sense, but it prevented ossified
hereditary aristocracy and brought fresh blood into governance based on merit (to an extent) . One
could argue this made the political institutions more pluralistic at the elite level  (if not broadly inclusive)
and thereby more resilient, delaying “failure.” The Qing Dynasty’s relatively enlightened early rulers (like
Kangxi  and  Qianlong)  invested  in  public  goods  (grand  canal  repairs,  flood  control,  granaries)  to  keep
peasants alive and farming, which suggests they understood that  extracting too much would kill the
golden goose . In A&R’s terms, the Qing may have been extractive, but with occasional inclusive economic
elements  (encouraging internal trade, protecting smallholders somewhat, integrating new regions) that
allowed it to sustain growth in the 18th century. It’s a reminder that the extractive-inclusive spectrum can
have gradations. Chinese history provides cases of what one might call “temporarily inclusive” interludes
under an extractive umbrella  – for instance, after huge demographic shocks, as we saw, rulers had to
adopt more inclusive measures (land grants, tax breaks, light corvée) to rebuild. These measures improved
labor’s lot for a generation or two until population pressure and elite capture reversed them. This cycle of
reform and regression is something A&R note in other contexts (they call it “institutional drift” and reversion
to extractive norms), and China exemplifies it. 
Labor  Bargaining  Power  and  Institutions:  A&R  highlight  that  inclusive  institutions  empower  broad
segments of society, giving them bargaining power and stake in the system, whereas extractive ones
disenfranchise them. Chinese history largely corroborates this: Chinese workers and peasants had almost
no formal bargaining power under imperial and Maoist extractive systems, and indeed they reaped few
gains in income or rights. Only when demographic or economic conditions externally improved (like less
population = more land per peasant, or post-Mao reforms allowing some negotiation of wages) did their
situation  improve.  A&R  frequently  cite  the  example  of  the  Black  Death  in  14th  century  Europe
empowering peasants because labor became scarce. Did something similar happen in China’s 14th century
(after Mongol rule and plagues)? Historical records do indicate that Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang was
relatively favorable to peasants early on: he distributed land and tried to freeze rents, an attempt to lock in
peasants’  improved  bargaining  position  after  the  population  loss.  But  over  time,  as  Ming  population
recovered, landlords regained leverage, illustrating how quickly labor’s bargaining power evaporated when
abundance returned. Another telling episode is the  post-Taiping Rebellion period : in some regions of
central China, the scarcity of labor and abundance of land meant survivors could negotiate lower rents or
become owner-cultivators. Yet by the late 19th century, as population grew, many became tenants again
under new landlords or the gentry-led militias that emerged (the xiangyong  or local army leaders often took
over land). So again, labor bargaining power in China historically has been fleeting and contingent on
shocks rather than institutionalized rights. This is fully consistent with A&R: whenever a window opened for
greater bargaining power (due to shock), China lacked durable inclusive institutions to cement those gains,
so elites eventually reasserted control.
One potential challenge to A&R  using China could be: China often achieved impressive state-led feats (like
massive infrastructure or a cohesive market early on) that some scholars argue were beneficial, even if
institutions were extractive. For instance, political centralization under Qin or Sui, though brutal, did unify
China and arguably laid groundwork for future prosperity (the canals built by Sui at terrible human cost
later underpinned Tang economic integration). A&R’s framework might see only the extractive cost, but not8
17
the  long-term  benefit.  They  would  likely  counter  that  inclusive  methods  could  have  achieved  growth
without the human toll, but history didn’t provide a control experiment. 
Modern China and A&R’s Theory:  The period from 1949 to today in China offers a rich test of Why Nations
Fail.  The  Communist  revolution  destroyed  the  old  landlord  class  (eliminating  one  form  of  extractive
institution), but replaced it with a one-party state (arguably another extractive institution, politically). Maoist
China was extremely extractive economically – the state took surplus from both peasants and workers to
invest in heavy industry, while politically it brooked no opposition. A&R would predict such a system to
produce poor long-run results, which was true by 1976: China was economically stagnant and scarred by
famine and violence (the Cultural Revolution). Indeed, A&R describe Mao’s China as an example of an
attempt at “communist” extractive institutions that failed to generate prosperity, similar to the Soviet Union.
However , post-1978 China  is more complex. Deng Xiaoping and subsequent leaders introduced inclusive
economic  institutions  to  some  degree  –  they  allowed  private  enterprise,  market  pricing,  foreign
investment,  and  gave  individuals  freedom  to  choose  jobs  (at  least  compared  to  the  Mao  era).  James
Robinson  himself  has  noted  that  China’s  growth  after  the  1970s  happened  “ exactly  because  economic
institutions  were  moved  in  [a]  more  inclusive  direction ”.  For  example,  farmers  could  keep  profits,
entrepreneurs could start companies, and later , property rights were strengthened for businesses. These
changes align with many inclusive features A&R emphasize: stronger incentives for innovation and effort,
more  participation  in  markets  by  broad  segments  of  society,  etc.  But  politically,  China  remained
authoritarian – not inclusive in the A&R sense of broad pluralism. A&R’s prediction for such a scenario
(sustained extractive politics with partially inclusive economics) is that growth can occur for a while, but it
might be unstable or reach a limit. In Why Nations Fail  (2012), they indeed argued that China’s boom was
likely unsustainable unless political institutions became inclusive. They drew parallels to the rapid but
ultimately stagnating growth of the Soviet Union, or South Korea under dictatorship (which only fully
prospered after democratizing, by their account). 
So far , China’s growth has lasted several decades, outperforming the Soviet timeline, which some view as a
challenge to A&R’s emphasis on political inclusion . But it might be that the reckoning is simply yet to
come. Recent developments lend some support to A&R: China’s economy has markedly slowed from the
double-digit highs, and problems like corruption, debt, and inefficiencies of state enterprises (all linked to
lack of inclusive checks and balances) have grown. A&R might say China is approaching the point where the
extractive political structure will hinder further innovation – for instance, crackdowns on tech companies
and tighter Party control over the economy under Xi Jinping could stifle the very entrepreneurship that
drove earlier growth. There’s also the risk of a “stationary bandit”  scenario turning into a “roving bandit”
scenario if political infighting or succession crises occur (i.e., if the centralized extractive power falters,
disorder could unravel gains). So the jury is still out, but A&R’s framework remains relevant: it predicts that
without inclusive reforms, China may face stagnation as the old model exhausts itself.
Regarding labor power in modern China , one could argue that the Reform era allowed a quasi-inclusion
by empowering people to choose jobs and migrate – a freedom that did improve their bargaining position
eventually. But the continued ban on independent unions and the heavy suppression of labor NGOs (for
example, arrests of worker organizers in Guangdong in 2015) show that the Party does not allow labor to
become an independent political force. In A&R’s terms, the ruling elite (the Communist Party princeling
class and aligned capitalists) remain extractive in that they do not share power with workers. What has
happened  is  that  to  keep  extracting  (or  to  keep  stability),  they  have  granted  workers  some  material
improvements. This is reminiscent of the  “authoritarian bargain”  or what A&R call limited  “relatively
18
inclusive economic institutions under an extractive political system” . Historically, that bargain can
deliver growth but is precarious. As China’s workforce shrinks and ages, labor might demand a greater
voice (there have been rising incidents of labor protest over layoffs, pensions, gig economy conditions, etc.).
If the state does not accommodate these inclusively, the conflict could increase or the efficiency of the
economy could suffer because discontented, unempowered workers are not as productive or innovative as
empowered ones.
Demographic Shocks and Institutional Change:  Chinese history strongly illustrates how  shocks like
massive population loss can change the institutional equilibrium , albeit sometimes briefly. A&R discuss
how the Black Death led to the decline of feudal serfdom in Western Europe because peasants could
demand  freedom  and  wages,  whereas  in  Eastern  Europe  it  led  to  a  second  serfdom  because  nobles
doubled down on extraction. In China’s case, after the Mongol devastations and the Black Death, the Ming
began with relatively pro-peasant policies (lower rents, more land rights), hinting at an inclusive turn, but it
didn’t last – possibly because the centralized imperial system allowed the elite bureaucracy to reassert
control, whereas in Western Europe the fragmentation allowed more sustained freedom for peasants in
some regions. Similarly, after the Taiping rebellion, one might have expected some lasting changes: indeed,
the late Qing initiated the “New Policies” reforms in the 1900s which included modernizing the military,
industry, and even considering a constitution – arguably a move towards inclusive institutions (too late to
save the dynasty, though). One could posit that had Qing not fallen in 1911, it might have evolved into a
constitutional  monarchy  with  more  inclusive  governance  (like  Japan  did).  Instead,  war  and  revolution
intervened, bringing another form of extractive rule (the warlord era, then Nationalists, then Communists).
The Mao-to-Deng transition is also interpretable as a reaction to crisis: the Cultural Revolution chaos and
near collapse of the economy in 1976 was a “shock” that convinced elites to adopt radically new policies
(Reform and Opening). Deng Xiaoping essentially introduced elements of inclusive economics (markets,
private incentives) to save the Party’s rule – a conscious top-down adjustment to avoid failure. This aligns
with A&R’s idea that fear of losing power can drive elites to allow just enough inclusion to preserve the
system  (as  the  Qing  did  with  late  reforms,  or  South  Korea’s  dictatorship  did  by  eventually  allowing
democracy under pressure). The CCP’s adaptation in 1978 was successful economically, but they did not
follow through politically – raising the question of whether that will ultimately cause failure or force another
adaptation (perhaps the CCP’s own kind of late Qing moment sometime in the future).
In conclusion, examining China through the A&R framework: 
Supports their model:  The general trend that extractive institutions dominated Chinese history and
led to a pattern of high output but low per-capita gains and periodic collapse fits A&R. The fact that
China’s recent growth spurt coincided with an opening of economic institutions (farmers’ rights to
output, private businesses, FDI, competition) also supports their view that inclusion (even limited)
drives prosperity. Moreover , China is now showing signs (environmental crises, inequality, slowing
innovation) that could be attributed to the limits of extractive governance.
Extends their model:  China’s example extends A&R by highlighting the role of demography in the
inclusive-extractive  balance.  An  abundance  of  labor  made  it  easier  for  institutions  to  remain
extractive (elites had less incentive to change), whereas scarcity created leverage for reform. It
shows how an external factor like population can modulate institutional outcomes, something A&R
acknowledge but perhaps underplay relative to their heavy focus on institutions themselves. Also,
China illustrates that a state can be highly centralized (extractive politically) yet last long by using• 
• 
19
certain stabilizing measures (meritocratic bureaucracy, ideological legitimacy like Confucianism or
nationalism) – suggesting that not all extractive regimes collapse quickly; some manage a measured
extractive equilibrium  for centuries, though arguably at the cost of technological stagnation.
Challenges their model:  The obvious challenge is modern China’s sustained economic boom under
authoritarian rule. A&R would likely respond (and have) that China’s growth is “despite” not “because
of”  its  extractive  politics  –  essentially  a  one-off  allowed  by  China’s  willingness  to  use  global
technology and its large labor pool, but one that will stall without institutional change. Indeed,
Robinson in 2024 (now a Nobel laureate) reiterated that view, insisting China’s success owes to
inclusive economic moves within an authoritarian context , and that the ultimate test is whether it
transitions  toward  truly  inclusive  institutions  or  hits  a  wall.  As  of  mid-2020s,  with  Xi  Jinping
concentrating power further (a more extractive political turn) and the economy cooling, one could
argue the challenges A&R foresaw are materializing. The coming decades will either reinforce A&R’s
theory (if China stagnates or has crises due to its institutions) or perhaps force a re-evaluation (if
China finds a way to remain dynamic without Western-style inclusion, or if it successfully reforms
politically).
In terms of labor bargaining power , A&R’s emphasis would be that without inclusive political institutions,
Chinese workers and peasants historically lacked any formal power . Change only came when elites granted
it or when catastrophe struck – not through incremental bargaining as seen in inclusive societies (like labor
movements forcing reforms in Western democracies). The brief early 20th-century labor upsurge that was
crushed,  and  the  Tiananmen  protests  of  1989  (which  had  significant  worker  participation  and  were
crushed),  underscore  that  whenever  labor  tried  to  assert  itself  independently,  the  extractive  state
responded with force. That remains true today; hence labor’s influence on policy is indirect at best (filtered
through the Party’s calculations of maintaining stability). This reinforces A&R’s point that broad prosperity
is hard to maintain when the majority have no voice  – eventually their discontent or lack of buy-in can
destabilize the system.
In  summary,  applying  Why  Nations  Fail  to  China  reveals  a  complex  picture  but  largely  validates  the
framework’s  core  ideas.  Chinese  history  offers  a  vivid  long-term  case  of  predominantly  extractive
institutions yielding cyclical strength and weakness, and recent decades illustrate both the potential of
limited inclusion and the perils of remaining extractive. The state’s historical view of labor as a renewable
resource fits into the extractive pattern, and the current shifts indicate that to sustain progress, China will
need  to  place  higher  value  on  each  individual  –  essentially  moving  towards  more  inclusive  practices,
whether or not it ever adopts full democracy. If it fails to do so, A&R’s theory would predict a difficult road
ahead as the old model runs out of steam. If it does manage to reform institutions in a more inclusive
direction (even within a one-party framework), it would in effect be confirming the necessity of inclusion for
long-term prosperity. In either case, examining labor and population in China’s history through this lens
underscores A&R’s contention that who holds power in society – and how they use or relinquish it – is
central to understanding economic outcomes.
Conclusion
The saga of labor in Chinese history is one of epic scale and dramatic transformations. From the early
emperors who coerced millions to build walls and canals, regarding human toil as the cheapest input, to the
modern factories where migrants sell their work for wages under evolving regulations, the worth accorded
to individual lives and labor has continually shifted with China’s demographic and institutional tides. For• 
20
over two millennia, China’s rulers operated under the assumption (often valid in context) that people were
plentiful  – more so than arable land or capital – and thus labor could be expended lavishly. This led to
astonishing feats: ancient irrigation systems, grand imperial palaces, a standing army that subdued foes,
and in modern times, an export machine that flooded the world with affordable goods. But it also meant
that human costs were frequently staggering, and personal freedoms scant. The history detailed in this
report  showed  that  only  in  moments  of  population  scarcity  or  social  collapse  did  the  value  of  the
individual rise perceptibly on the state’s ledger , prompting reforms and a kinder hand – until the population
grew again or control was reasserted.
In the 21st century, China stands at another historical pivot. The combination of the  One-Child Policy’s
demographic legacy  and the maturation of the economy has made labor a relatively scarce resource for
perhaps the first time on a national scale. The Chinese state’s calculus is visibly changing: policies now aim
to encourage each birth, retain each worker, and boost each person’s productivity . The hukou system,
once an instrument to confine and exploit surplus rural labor , is gradually loosening as the surplus dries up.
There is greater recognition that an educated, innovative workforce – not just a numerous one – is key to
the next phase of development. This may herald a new era (one cautiously hoped for by many observers) in
which the relationship between the state and its people becomes less extractive and more  investitive  –
investing  in  human  capital  and  welfare  to  sustain  prosperity.  Already,  China’s  leadership  has  framed
initiatives like “Common Prosperity” to address inequality and excessive exploitation, indicating an official
acknowledgment that the well-being of each citizen matters for the nation’s stability and progress.
Whether China can successfully navigate this transition while maintaining its political model is a question
that intertwines with Acemoglu and Robinson’s thesis. Chinese history provides supporting evidence for
Why Nations Fail  in demonstrating the pitfalls of extractive institutions – from peasant uprisings against
oppressive  dynasties  to  the  ultimate  implosion  of  Mao’s  overreach  –  and  the  boost  that  even  partial
inclusive moves can give (as seen in the post-1978 boom). At the same time, China’s experience tempers the
theory with nuance, suggesting that state capacity and strategic reforms  can sometimes prolong the life
of extractive systems or temporarily deliver results, though often with an eventual reckoning. The ongoing
demographic  and  labor  shifts  could  indeed  be  that  reckoning:  as  China  can  no  longer  rely  on  ever-
increasing quantities of labor , it may find that the quality of institutions – inclusive or not – determines if it
will continue to thrive or hit a developmental ceiling.
In conclusion, the story of labor power in China from imperial times to the present is a testament to the
profound impact of population dynamics on a civilization’s political economy. Abundance of labor enabled
China’s rulers to build great works and sustain empire, yet it also tempted them into a cycle of over-
extraction that undercut long-term advancement. Scarcity of labor , when it arose, sometimes empowered
the people and prompted reforms, but often only fleetingly. Today, as China faces a future with fewer
children, more retirees, and a more educated but more assertive workforce, the “renewable” labor resource
is no longer infinite. The state’s valuation of individual lives – as seen through policy changes on hukou,
labor law, and family planning – is rising out of pragmatic necessity. How far this revaluation goes, and
whether it is accompanied by more institutional inclusion, will shape China’s trajectory in the decades to
come. One thing is clear: the era of treating China’s labor as an undifferentiated, endlessly replaceable mass
is ending. In its place, a new social contract must emerge, one that recognizes that each worker is also a
citizen with rights and an individual with aspirations. The longevity of China’s prosperity may well depend
on how this new balance is struck – echoing lessons from its own rich history and from global patterns of
why nations succeed or fail.
