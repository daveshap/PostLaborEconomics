The Structural Decline of Labor’s Share in the Age
of Automation
Introduction
Around the world, workers’ slice of the economic pie – the labor share of national income – has been
eroding  for  decades.  The  labor  share  measures  the  portion  of  output  that  accrues  to  workers  as
compensation (wages, salaries, and benefits), as opposed to capital owners in the form of profits, rents, and
dividends .  A  growing  body  of  evidence  indicates  this  decline  is  structural:  in  many  advanced
economies the labor share has trended downward since at least the 1980s, even as the capital share has
risen  commensurately .  This  shift  in  income  distribution  has  coincided  with  rapid  advances  in
technology  –  from  industrial  robotics  to  artificial  intelligence  –  which  increasingly  allow  machines  to
perform tasks once done by humans. A broad empirical consensus has emerged that  automation and
related technological changes are a central driver of the falling labor share , alongside other global
forces such as trade integration and the rise of high‑profit “superstar” firms . Policymakers and
institutions at every level are now grappling with what these trends portend. This report examines the
macroeconomic indicators behind labor’s declining share, drawing on the latest data and models from
county dashboards to international agencies. It surveys how governments, research arms, and think tanks
in the US, UK, and EU are diagnosing the problem, measuring its evolution, and planning for a future in
which capital may claim an ever-larger portion of economic gains.
Global Indicators of a Falling Labor Share
The downward slide of labor’s income share is a worldwide phenomenon documented by major economic
institutions. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the  global labor income share
declined from about 53.9% of output in 2004 to 52.3% by 2024 , a drop of 1.6 percentage points . In
recent years the trend has continued: between 2019 and 2022 alone, the global share going to labor fell by
0.6 points and had not recovered as of 2024 . In practical terms, this means a smaller piece of total
income is paid out as wages and salaries, while a larger piece is captured as gross operating surplus (profits
and other capital income). The ILO notes that the global labor share is now stagnating near historic lows,
putting “upward pressure on inequality” as more income flows to capital owners . Even in 2022–2023, a
period of strong post-pandemic job growth in many regions, labor’s share remained flat at about 52%
globally, significantly below its mid-20th-century levels .
This  broad  pattern  holds  across  most  advanced  economies,  although  the  magnitude  varies.  The
International Monetary Fund (IMF) has documented a pervasive decline in labor’s share since the
early 1990s across a large sample of countries . In its World Economic Outlook analysis, the IMF found
labor income shares in advanced economies began trending down in the 1980s, reached low points around
the late 2000s, and as of the 2010s were roughly 3–4 percentage points lower than in 1970  on average
. For emerging-market economies, the decline started later and has been linked more to globalization
and capital deepening, but many developing countries have also seen labor shares fall . An OECD review
likewise confirms a “statistically significant but small decline” in the average labor share across its member12

countries over the past two decades . (Notably, the OECD points out that if one adjusts for capital
depreciation, the net labor share’s decline appears more modest  – a nuance indicating that a rising
depreciation  cost  of  new  technology  capital  accounts  for  part  of  the  shift.  Still,  on  a  gross  basis  the
downward trend is clear .) In short, a  strong empirical consensus has emerged  that the distribution of
national income is shifting: labor is losing ground nearly everywhere, even as total economic output has
grown.
Crucially, this structural decline in labor’s share must be distinguished from cyclical fluctuations. Labor’s
share tends to rise temporarily during recessions , since profits typically collapse faster than wages in an
economic downturn . For example, during the COVID-19 shock in 2020, government wage supports and
falling corporate earnings caused labor’s share to spike in many countries . But these boosts proved
transitory. As recoveries took hold, labor’s share generally fell back to its prior trend line . The
overarching story is one of a downward drift over multiple business cycles. The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of
Kansas City notes that after the pandemic recession, the labor share “fell to previous norms” by late 2021,
resuming the typical pattern seen over decades . In the euro area, the wage share rebounded with
heavy pandemic supports in 2020, but by the end of 2022 it had receded to about 61% – slightly below its
pre-pandemic level and below its long-run average (roughly 62–65%) . These episodes underscore
that  the structural decline of labor’s share is not a product of one crisis or another, but a long-run
trend  driven by deeper forces. As the European Central Bank observes, the trajectory reflects “long-term
structural drivers, such as technological changes, globalisation… and institutional characteristics,” rather
than just medium-term cycles .
The United States: Declining Labor Share and Technological Drivers
In the United States, the erosion of labor’s share of income is starkly evident in the data. In the nonfarm
business sector – the backbone of the U.S. economy – labor’s share has fallen from about 65% in the
late 1940s to around 56–58% in recent years . U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) figures show a
steady postwar decline: in 1947 workers received roughly two-thirds of output as compensation, but by
2000 the share was closer to 63%, and it dropped sharply thereafter . Labor’s share dipped below 60% in
the mid-2000s and hit a modern low of just 56.0% in late 2011 . While there was a modest rebound
after 2012 – climbing back to about 58.4% by 2016 as the economy recovered from the Great Recession
 – this proved only a partial recovery. As of 2023–2025, the labor share remains well under historical
norms. Federal Reserve data (FRED) indexed to 2017=100 show the U.S. labor share hovering in the high 90s
(i.e. a few percent below its 2017 level) through early 2025 , implying it has not regained the highs of
past decades. According to analysis in the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity , the U.S. labor share in the
private sector dropped from 63% in 1980 to just 56% by 2017  – a dramatic shift in how the fruits of
growth are allocated. Over that same period, median real wages barely rose (only ~16% growth from 1980
to 2017, despite GDP per capita roughly doubling) , illustrating how a falling labor share has translated
into wage stagnation for typical workers even as productivity climbed.
Economists  increasingly  link  America’s  labor  share  decline  to  the  rapid  adoption  of  labor-saving
technologies. The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw production processes become radically more
automated in the U.S., with the diffusion of computerized machinery, industrial robots, and now artificial
intelligence tools . For instance, the number of industrial robots per thousand manufacturing workers in
the U.S. jumped from 2.5 in 1993 to about 20 by 2019 . Since the mid-2000s, firms have also begun
integrating AI-related capabilities (however nascent); by 2018, about 0.75% of all job postings were already
for AI-related roles, reflecting the spread of the new technology . These innovations boost productivity,11

but by directly replacing certain tasks and jobs, they tend to reduce the proportion of income going
to labor . As MIT economists Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo bluntly state, “by replacing
labor with machines in production tasks, automation reduces labor’s share of value added (and national
income)” . Automation has been a persistent engine of U.S. productivity growth since the Industrial
Revolution, but what’s different now – in the age of AI – is the concern that automation may outpace the
creation of new labor-intensive tasks. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently warned lawmakers
that advanced AI could “undermine labor’s share of national income” in the long run  in a way previous
technologies did not, potentially  permanently  reducing labor’s importance in the economy . This
marks a significant recognition at the policy level that the historical stability of factor shares (once treated
as near-constant) may be breaking down due to modern technology .
Beyond  technology,  studies  indicate  other  forces  have  amplified  the  U.S.  labor  share  decline.  Trade
globalization has exerted pressure by exposing labor-intensive American industries to low-cost foreign
competition, encouraging offshoring of production . Diminished worker bargaining power – evidenced
by union decline and more “flexible” labor markets – is also frequently cited. Indeed, research by the
Resolution Foundation notes that the falling labor share is often attributed to “the rise of globalisation,
technological progress and diminished worker power – forces which have been at play across advanced
economies” . However , quantitative analyses suggest technology’s role dominates in the U.S. case. The
IMF found that roughly half of the drop in labor’s share in advanced economies can be explained by
technological progress – especially the steep decline in the price of capital goods (like computer
equipment and software) and the automation of routine tasks . By contrast, increased trade
integration  and  offshoring  accounted  for  perhaps  half  as  much  impact  as  technology  in  advanced
economies .  This  aligns  with  findings  by  the  Brookings  Institution  and  others.  For  example,  a
Brookings study by Elsby et al. observed that in the U.S. since the 1980s, the manufacturing and trade
sectors have led the labor share decline, pointing to globalization (outsourcing of labor-intensive supply
chain components) as “a leading potential explanation” – yet they also found “limited support” for pure
capital-for-labor substitution in many sectors . In manufacturing specifically, there is evidence that
the drop in labor share is tied to the rise of dominant, highly automated firms. Researchers have noted that
within U.S. manufacturing, the typical plant’s labor share has not collapsed; rather , a disproportionate share
of output shifted to “hyper-productive” plants that operate at much lower labor share, driving down the
aggregate share . This speaks to the “superstar firm” effect  – a small number of highly efficient,
capital-intensive firms capturing outsized market share and profits . Such firms often have lower
labor cost ratios, so as they account for more of the economy, the overall labor share falls .
American policymakers are increasingly aware of these dynamics. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office
now routinely factors a stable or slightly declining labor share into its long-term budget projections. (The
Social Security Trustees, for instance, assume that the labor compensation ratio to GDP will remain constant
in the very long run after recent declines, effectively building a flat labor share into their models on the
premise that factor shares “tend toward stable proportions” eventually .) Yet there is growing debate
about whether such assumptions will hold in the face of AI and robotics. The U.S. House Budget Committee
in 2023 commissioned the CBO’s first-ever report on artificial intelligence and the economy, underscoring
concern that automation’s next wave could suppress wage growth and labor’s income share further .
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia recently explored an unsettling scenario: if generative AI lives
up  to  its  transformative  billing,  it  could  herald  a  “once-in-a-lifetime  decline  in  labor’s  share  of
national income,” permanently altering the historical balance between labor and capital . In
short, the U.S. policy establishment now recognizes the declining labor share as a fundamental economic
challenge intertwined with automation and innovation policy. From the White House Council of Economic3132

Advisers to regional Fed banks, there is an active effort to monitor labor share metrics and develop policy
responses (ranging from tax code reforms to job training investments) to ensure the benefits of technology-
led growth are more broadly shared .
The United Kingdom: A Divergent Trend Amid Global Forces
The United Kingdom’s experience with labor’s share of income has similarities to, but also key differences
from, the U.S. story. Historically, the UK saw a significant decline in labor’s share through the late 20th
century, especially during the 1980s era of economic restructuring. However , since the mid-1990s the UK
labor share has not continued falling in the clear-cut way seen in the U.S. or some EU countries. Official UK
data show that the labor share fell from the postwar period into the 1990s, then stabilized and even
recovered  modestly  after  the  late  1990s .  The  Office  for  National  Statistics  (ONS)  recently
published a comprehensive analysis, “Trends in the UK labour share: 1997 to 2023,” which finds that by
using their preferred measure, the UK labor share in 2023 was about 5–6 percentage points higher than
in 1996 . In other words, labor’s share in Britain has risen slightly over the past quarter-century,
reversing a portion of the earlier long-run decline. All measurement methods the ONS explored (which
differ in how they attribute mixed income of the self-employed) agree on the pattern: a pronounced drop in
labor share from the 1970s to mid-1990s, followed by a recovery of several percentage points by the early
2000s and relative stability thereafter . By the late 2010s, the UK labor share was roughly in line with
its level in the late 1970s after this partial rebound . The share of national income going to labor in
Britain today is generally estimated in the mid-50s percent (depending on the methodology) – higher than
the mid-40s percent lows that prevailed in the mid-1990s, but not back to the ~60% levels seen in the 1970s
.
What accounts for the UK’s stabilization of labor share since 2000? One factor has been the policy-driven
boost  in  labor  compensation  beyond  just  wages.  The  ONS  analysis  points  out  that  a  strong  rise  in
employers’ social contributions (like pension contributions and National Insurance) has propped up the
measured labor share since the late 1990s . For example, the auto-enrollment pension reforms after
2012 greatly expanded workplace pension coverage (from 47% of employees participating in 2012 to 79%
by 2021), increasing employers’ pension contributions (a component of labor compensation) significantly
. Additionally, increases in employer National Insurance contribution rates and efforts to reduce
pension fund deficits led to faster growth of non-wage benefits . These developments mean that
even as wages and mixed income grew at roughly the pace of GDP, the total labor compensation grew a bit
faster , lifting labor’s share. Between 1996 and 2023, total labor income in the UK (including wages, salaries,
and the labor portion of self-employment income) grew about 230%, whereas gross operating surplus
(profits) grew ~160% and overall nominal GDP ~200% . Thus, labor income outpaced capital income –
a reversal of earlier trends – accounting for the rise in labor share over that period .
However , the UK is not immune to the global forces putting downward pressure on labor’s share. British
economists  acknowledge  that  the  same  structural  drivers  identified  elsewhere  –  technological
change, globalization, and changing market power dynamics – have been at work in the UK as well
. The ONS explicitly notes that the long-run decline observed in many advanced countries is “a
feature” internationally and “has been attributed to” offshoring of labor-intensive activities, widespread
adoption of information and communication technologies (ICT) and intangible capital that substitute for
workers, and the emergence of “superstar firms” with high profit margins and low labor shares . All
these factors have been present in the UK economy. Indeed, the Resolution Foundation finds that the
notion of “decoupling”  – where productivity growth no longer translates into commensurate pay growth5455

for workers – exists in the UK, though to a lesser degree than in the U.S. . From 1980 to 2018, UK
productivity (output per hour) grew substantially faster than median pay, opening a wedge of about 24
percentage  points  (versus  a  much  larger  58-point  wedge  in  the  U.S.  over  a  similar  period) .  The
Foundation emphasizes that in many analyses, decoupling is essentially a proxy for labor’s shrinking share
of income . And it reiterates that the suspected causes of labor share decline in advanced economies
“derive from the rise of globalisation, technological progress and diminished worker power.”  In
the UK context, diminished unionization and labor market liberalization in the 1980s likely accelerated the
fall in labor share at that time. But after the 1990s, Britain’s more robust wage-setting institutions (like
inflation-indexed minimum wage increases and collective bargaining in some sectors) may have helped
labor income keep pace with GDP. It is telling that, according to the ONS, all approaches to measuring the
UK labor share show a “relatively rapid fall” during the 1980s followed by a rebound around 1997–2001
and  then  stability .  That  inflection  corresponds  with  economic  and  policy  changes  (e.g.  the
introduction of the national minimum wage in 1999, stronger employment law, etc.) that shored up labor’s
position. 
As a result, while the UK has not seen a continued structural decline in labor share in the 21st century ,
policymakers  remain  vigilant.  The  Bank  of  England  and  others  track  labor’s  share  as  an  indicator  of
inflationary pressure and bargaining power . The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) incorporates
labor income trends into its fiscal forecasts for earnings and tax revenues . Think tanks like the
Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) and Resolution Foundation frequently analyze the distribution of national
income, warning that even a stable labor share can mask inequalities (such as a smaller slice of the pie
going to low- and middle-wage workers) . Indeed, a Resolution Foundation report titled “Follow the
money” highlighted that lower earners’ share of national income has fallen  even if the aggregate labor
share hasn’t collapsed – reflecting inequality within labor’s slice . Thus, the conversation in the UK is
now less about an ongoing aggregate decline (as in the U.S.) and more about ensuring that labor’s existing
share  is  distributed  fairly  and  can  rise  in  line  with  productivity.  Nevertheless,  the  same  disruptive
technologies – AI, robotics, digital platforms – are arriving on British shores, and there is awareness that
without careful policy, the UK could yet follow the U.S. path. The Bank of England, HM Treasury, and UK
research bodies are actively studying automation’s impact on wages and employment , aiming to
preempt any renewed fall in labor’s share as the Fourth Industrial Revolution unfolds.
Europe and the Euro Area: Broad Declines with Regional Nuance
Across continental Europe, labor’s share of income has generally been on a downward trend, though with
important variations between countries and time periods. On the whole, many EU economies mirror the
pattern of advanced economies elsewhere: a peak or stability mid-century followed by a slide from the
1980s  or  1990s  onward.  The  IMF’s  analysis  found  that  labor  shares  in  large  European  countries  (like
Germany,  France,  Italy,  Spain)  declined  through  the  1990s  and  2000s,  contributing  to  the  advanced-
economy averages . By one estimate, labor income shares in advanced EU economies as a group are
roughly 3–5 percentage points lower today than in the early 1970s . That said, Europe exhibits
some countervailing tendencies that have made the decline less uniform. For instance, France’s labor share
has fluctuated but remained relatively higher than in Anglo-Saxon economies, partly due to stronger labor
institutions.  Southern  European  countries  saw  big  declines  in  labor  share  particularly  after  the  2008
financial crisis and the eurozone crisis austerity period, when profits recovered but wage growth lagged. In
Germany, labor’s share fell markedly in the early 2000s during labor market reforms (Hartz reforms) that
suppressed wage growth, though it stabilized or even upticked in the late 2010s as wages rose faster than
productivity for a while. These differences mean that within Europe, there is no single monolithic trend –6970

but  the overall direction has been downward in most places, driven by the same global forces of
technology and globalization .
The European Commission’s research agencies have devoted extensive study to labor share dynamics in the
EU. A Joint Research Centre (JRC) report notes that Europe’s wave of robot adoption in manufacturing did
not  trigger  massive  aggregate  job  losses,  yet  it  did  contribute  to  a  falling  labor  income  share  by
concentrating output in highly automated firms . In fact, a recent European Commission study,
“Robots and the Rise of European Superstar Firms,” found that industrial robotization in Europe has been
accompanied by rising industry concentration – essentially a few robot-intensive firms growing dominant –
which  in  turn  lowers  the  aggregate  labor  share .  This  echoes  the  U.S.  “superstar”  firm  effect  and
highlights a techno-economic feedback loop present in Europe as well. The European Central Bank (ECB)
points to “technological changes, globalisation, sectoral reallocation” as key structural drivers influencing
the euro area wage share over time . Moreover , the ECB has observed that institutional factors, like
collective bargaining coverage and wage-setting frameworks, play a role in how these forces translate into
the  labor  share .  Countries  with  stronger  collective  bargaining  or  frequent  minimum  wage
adjustments may see less of the decline because wages for lower-skilled workers are propped up. Still, even
those  institutional  buffers  have  limits  when  confronted  with  large  external  shocks  or  technological
upheavals.
Recent developments in Europe underscore that the labor share can shift abruptly with economic events.
The euro area’s wage share, as noted, spiked above 65% in 2020 during the worst of the pandemic (due to
government job retention schemes keeping workers on payrolls while GDP fell) . But by the end of
2022, amid a surge in corporate profits in energy and other sectors, the euro area labor share fell to just
above 61%, a level below its pre-pandemic baseline . This recent dip coincided with Russia’s war in
Ukraine which led to energy price shocks – boosting profit margins in commodity sectors while real wages
in many countries lagged inflation. Such volatility shows that even if structural trends are gradual, the labor
share can seesaw with terms-of-trade swings (a point also emphasized by OECD analyses of commodity
exporters). Importantly, however , these medium-term movements in Europe still overlay the longer-term
plateau or decline. The euro area labor share was “close to its long-term average” in 2019 at just over 62%
, and after the pandemic noise it is slightly below that average. In 1990, by contrast, many euro area
countries had labor shares in the mid to high 60s percent. So the trajectory over the past 30+ years has
been a moderate drift downward, with fluctuations, rather than a freefall. 
European  policymakers  at  both  the  national  and  EU  level  increasingly  frame  the  labor  share  issue  in
discussions of inequality and inclusive growth. The  European Commission’s 2024 Strategic Foresight
Report  flagged that without intervention, technological transformations (AI, digitalization, green transition)
could further skew income toward capital. The Commission and the OECD have jointly examined policy
levers – from skills training to corporate governance changes – to ensure productivity gains translate into
broad-based  wage  gains.  The  World  Economic  Forum  (WEF) ,  which  often  partners  with  European
institutions, has likewise highlighted the challenge: “Automation reduces labor’s share of value added,
contributes to inequality, and may reduce employment and wages,” WEF published via a 2019 briefing
.  That  statement,  coming  from  leading  economists  and  circulated  among  European  and  global
policymakers through WEF, encapsulates the concern that Europe’s social contract could be tested by the
next wave of AI and automation. So while Europe’s recent record on labor share is somewhat more mixed
(with places like the Netherlands or Sweden showing smaller declines, and others like Spain or Italy larger
ones), the recognition of a structural shift is common. From the halls of the ECB in Frankfurt to think tanks
in  Brussels  (e.g.  Bruegel,  which  has  extensively  analyzed  labor  share  trends ),  there  is  a  clear79

understanding that if current trends continue, workers will reap a shrinking portion of the continent’s
economic output . This has spurred debates on strengthening collective bargaining, updating competition
policy to check superstar firms, and taxing the windfall gains of automation.
Automation, AI, and the Future of Labor’s Share: Consensus and
Uncertainty
Across the U.S., UK, and EU cases, a strong empirical consensus emerges: advances in automation and
digital technology have been a primary driver of labor’s declining share , often outweighing other
factors in their impact . The mechanization of routine tasks by robots and software has enabled
greater output with less human labor input, directly lowering the labor share in affected industries .
For example, research cited by the World Bank finds that industries adopting more robots tend to see
labor’s share of value-added drop significantly – a pattern confirmed in both U.S. and European data
. In manufacturing, each additional robot per thousand workers has been associated with a measurable
reduction in the labor share and in wages, without proportionate job creation elsewhere . Meanwhile,
the growth of intangible, ICT-based capital (like software, algorithms, and intellectual property) further tilts
income toward capital owners because these assets can be scaled up at low marginal cost without hefty
labor compensation . The UK’s Kings College London, for instance, has documented how the rise of
intangible capital with high depreciation (software that must be continually replaced/upgraded) can inflate
capital’s share of gross income, though part of that is depreciation rather than pure profit . In summary,
technology is enabling both the substitution of machines for workers and the amplification of returns on
capital investments – a dual boost to capital’s income share.
That said, technology is not acting in isolation. Globalization has reinforced the shift : offshoring labor-
intensive production to lower-wage countries has effectively transferred a portion of income that would
have gone to domestic labor into either foreign labor or capital profits. The ONS explicitly lists offshoring as
a key cause of advanced-country labor share declines . The IMF likewise found that expanding global
value  chains  and  trade  openness  were  significant  (though  secondary  to  tech)  in  explaining  emerging
markets’ labor share changes . Another agreed factor is the erosion of labor market institutions
and  bargaining  power .  Where  union  density  fell  or  minimum  wages  lagged,  labor’s  claim  on  output
tended to shrink. For example, the U.S. saw union membership drop precipitously from the 1980s on, and
studies like Elsby et al. note this likely had some effect, though quantitatively it’s hard to fully disentangle
from trade and tech effects . In Europe, collective bargaining coverage declines in some countries
have correlated with larger labor share falls, and conversely nations with coordinated wage bargaining (like
some Nordics) have seen more stability. Finally,  market power and “superstar” dynamics  are a newer
explanatory  angle  gaining  consensus  support.  As  mentioned,  the  rise  of  highly  profitable  firms  that
dominate markets tends to lower labor’s share, because these firms have higher profit margins and often
invest heavily in automation. The Bruegel summary of Autor et al. (2020) notes that industries with greater
increases in concentration had larger labor share declines, supporting the “winner-take-most” hypothesis
. This suggests that antitrust policy and competitive markets are also pieces of the puzzle – a view
shared by the OECD and various G7 think tanks.
Looking forward, there is a mix of optimism and unease in forecasts. Traditional economic models assumed
that eventually labor share would stabilize – as the U.S. Social Security Trustees put it, factor shares “tend
toward stable proportions in the long run” . Many budget agencies still baseline their long-run
projections on a constant labor share, essentially assuming we won’t see a collapse of labor’s role. However ,3840

the rapid emergence of AI has led many experts to question this complacency . The Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco warns that AI could break historical patterns: unlike earlier technologies which
eventually generated new tasks for workers, AI may be able to continuously encroach on human roles
without fully compensating job creation . If so, labor’s share could structurally ratchet down further .
Even the IMF, typically conservative in such projections, has begun exploring scenarios in which AI-driven
productivity  comes  with  a  need  for  significant  redistribution  to  avoid  surging  inequality .  The
International Monetary Fund’s managing director and research teams have argued that fiscal policy
will need to “broaden the gains of AI”  – for example through tax and transfer schemes – specifically
because AI could otherwise concentrate income with capital owners (the tech innovators and investors) and
reduce labor’s slice . Likewise, the World Bank’s analysts suggest more radical ideas, like spreading
capital ownership. In a World Bank blog, economists proposed that to counter “the ongoing decline in
labor’s share of income” due to robotization, policies might include enabling workers to own stakes in the
robots and automated tools that are replacing them . In effect, if you can’t beat the capitalists, join
them – by turning workers into capital owners to get a share of the returns.
Policy Recognition and Planning
At the policy level, the structural decline of labor’s share has moved from academic journals to official
strategy documents. Governments and international institutions are not only acknowledging the trend but
also starting to plan around it. For instance, the European Commission’s recovery and resilience plans  for
member states encourage investments in digital skills and advanced manufacturing training – implicitly to
help workers maintain bargaining power and productivity alongside automation, thereby protecting labor’s
income share. The  U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA)  has funded regional workforce
initiatives to address automation’s impact, aiming to channel new technologies into augmenting workers
rather than replacing them. And the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended in 2019
that the Department of Labor develop better data to “track the workforce effects of advanced technologies”
so that policymakers can respond in real time . These are preventative, diagnostic measures at the
federal and state levels.
Think tanks are also informing policy responses. The  Brookings Institution  has put forward concrete
proposals  to  curb  the  bias  toward  capital  in  the  tax  code,  which  currently  can  encourage  excessive
automation. A Brookings paper by Acemoglu et al. argued that the U.S. tax system effectively subsidized
equipment and software investment while taxing labor more heavily, and that this “biased against labor”
regime likely “generates excessive automation and suboptimally low levels of employment and labor
share.”  The authors suggest adjusting capital vs. labor taxation (even exploring an “automation tax”
on AI and robots in certain contexts) to ensure that automation is adopted only where truly productive, not
merely because it’s artificially cheap due to tax advantages . In the UK, the Institute for Public Policy
Research (IPPR) and others have floated ideas like establishing worker tech councils and giving workers
equity in firms that deploy AI extensively, again to align the distribution of gains. The  World Economic
Forum ,  in  its  2023  Future  of  Jobs  report,  emphasizes  reskilling  as  vital  –  but  also  notes  that  without
deliberate effort, the benefits of higher productivity could accrue mostly to corporate profits. The WEF’s calls
for a “new social contract” often revolve around ensuring labor gets a fair share of the digital economy’s
wealth, for example through wage-setting innovations or even universal basic income trials if labor market
churn increases.
International  bodies  are  coordinating  some  of  these  policy  discussions.  The  OECD’s  Future  of  Work
initiative  brings together countries to share best practices on reinforcing labor share. The G20, under the3334

2024 presidency, included in its declaration a commitment to “inclusive growth” such that wages grow with
productivity – a tacit reference to the labor share issue. A technical paper prepared for the G20 noted that
from 2004 to 2024 the global labor income share fell from 53.9% to 52.3% and warned this trend could
worsen with new technologies if policy fails to adapt . It recommended measures ranging from
strengthening  collective  bargaining  to  social  protection  floors  and  progressive  taxation  to  redistribute
income . Even the traditionally growth-focused World Bank has, as shown, begun to discuss labor
share decline in the context of “robotic rents” and economic feudalism if workers cannot obtain capital
income . 
Meanwhile, central banks are incorporating labor share metrics into their analytical toolkits, since a falling
labor share can suppress wage-push inflation and may partly explain low inflation eras pre-pandemic (as
profits absorbed more of the growth). The ECB’s economic bulletin now frequently analyzes the split of
value added between labor and capital for signs of underlying inflation pressures . The Bank of
England, in assessing wage growth, has noted that if labor’s share remains low, even a tight labor market
might not translate into spiraling wages, altering the Phillips curve dynamic. In the U.S., Federal Reserve
economists have studied labor share decline as both cause and consequence of lower labor bargaining
power , informing the Fed’s views on maximum employment and income inequality. 
To be sure, there are  dissenting voices and uncertainties . A minority of economists argue that if we
measure income shares net of depreciation and after taxes, labor’s share hasn’t fallen as much – it’s the rise
in depreciation (from shorter-lived high-tech capital) that makes the gross labor share look worse .
Others point out that in some countries, like the UK recently, labor’s share did not decline and thus global
generalizations must be carefully made. These nuances are valid, but they do not negate the overall pattern
observed in the bulk of large economies. The statistical and institutional consensus remains that  labor’s
share of income is under structural downward pressure in the 21st century . Moreover , most dissenting
interpretations still acknowledge the role of technology; they simply debate the magnitude or whether
other factors like market power might be even more important. Notably, an IMF working paper in 2023
found that in U.S. manufacturing, increasing monopoly power could explain up to 76% of the labor share
decline – implying that anti-competitive practices and market consolidation are pivotal . This doesn’t
so much contradict the tech narrative as complement it (since technology often enables winner-take-all
markets). It does, however , suggest that policy to boost competition – breaking up monopolies, preventing
abuse of dominant AI platforms – could help counteract labor share declines.
Conclusion
In sum, the evidence is overwhelming that  labor’s share of national income has been in structural
decline  in many economies, and that this shift is closely intertwined with the rise of automation, AI, and
other capital-augmenting technologies. From the United States to Europe, macroeconomic indicators – the
labor compensation share of GDP, the profit share, real wage trends – all tell a consistent story of workers
capturing a smaller proportion of output than in the late 20th century. This is not a transient blip but a long-
run trend recognized at the highest policy levels. Governments, central banks, and international institutions
have moved beyond abstract theory to confronting the hard data: for example, U.S. labor’s share in the
private sector fell about 7 percentage points since 1980 , and  labor’s slice of global income is near
record  lows  around  52% .  Meanwhile,  the  capital  share  –  including  corporate  profits  –  has
correspondingly risen, enriching capital owners and widening income inequalities. The driving forces –
technological advancement that replaces labor , globalization that arbitrages it, and market structures that
weaken its bargaining position – are widely acknowledged in current models and forecasts . As the96

UK’s ONS succinctly put it, the long-run decline in labor share “continues to be a feature of the labour share
in most advanced countries” and is attributable to known factors like offshoring, ICT automation, and
superstar firms .
Yet the story is not uniformly grim, nor is it devoid of agency. We have seen that policy choices matter: the
UK’s stabilization of labor share since the late 1990s hints that institutional support for wages (e.g. stronger
social safety nets, pension contributions, wage floors) can make a difference . Across the Atlantic,
proposals to tweak tax and competition policy suggest avenues to slow or reverse the decline . There
is also the fundamental economic insight that productivity growth need not translate into a lower labor
share  if accompanied  by  the  creation  of  new  labor-intensive  tasks  or  industries.  Historically,  new
technologies eventually generated new types of jobs that maintained labor’s share . The pressing
question for the future is whether artificial intelligence will follow that historical pattern or break it. If AI
mainly automates without empowering labor in new ways, then, as the Philadelphia Fed researchers warn,
we could be at “a turning point” where the labor share permanently downshifts . That prospect has
galvanized serious planning: the IMF urging fiscal redistribution , the World Bank advocating shared
robot ownership , and the WEF calling for a new balance in the social contract .
In the end, this is not a story of inevitability but of measurable trends meeting policy responses. The
numbers leave little doubt that labor’s share has fallen; the debate centers on how to respond. A strong
empirical consensus – across blue-chip think tanks like Brookings and Bruegel, agencies like the BLS and
ONS, and international bodies like the OECD and ILO – has put automation and related forces at the heart
of  the  diagnosis .  With  that  consensus,  attention  is  turning  to  solutions:  updating  educational
systems for an AI economy , reforming tax and labor laws to better distribute gains, and perhaps
fundamentally  rethinking  how  workers  can  claim  ownership  in  a  capital-intensive  world .  The
structural decline of labor’s share is thus both a warning and a call to action. It is a warning that without
intervention, the benefits of growth may increasingly accrue to capital, exacerbating inequality and social
discontent. But it is also a call to action for policymakers to harness the very forces of technology and
globalization in service of a more inclusive prosperity – ensuring that as robots and algorithms boost
productivity, the workers of the world are not left behind but rather share in the wealth they help create
. The stakes, as the data make clear , are nothing less than the future distribution of income in the
automation age.
