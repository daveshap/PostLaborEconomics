Participatory Ownership Models in a Post‑Labor
Economy
As automation and capital increasingly dominate production, participatory ownership models  offer ways
to broadly share wealth beyond wage labor . Over the last century, governments and communities
worldwide have experimented with public, cooperative, and hybrid ownership structures that generate
shared dividends or social benefits. This global survey spans national sovereign wealth funds and state
policies down to municipal trusts, cooperatives, and community funds. Each example includes empirical
outcomes – financial returns, distribution mechanisms, and social impacts – to illuminate best practices in
different contexts.
National Wealth Funds and Sovereign Dividends
Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs)  harness natural resource or public assets to benefit all citizens. A flagship
example is the Alaska Permanent Fund (APF)  in the United States. Established in 1976 to invest at least
25% of state oil royalties , the APF has grown to over  $64 billion . Every Alaskan resident – man,
woman, and child – receives an annual dividend , typically $1,000–$2,000 per person  (e.g. $1,114 in 2021 ; a
family of four got $4,456) . The largest payout was $3,269 in 2008 . These oil-funded dividends have
measurably reduced poverty and inequality: long-term studies show the APF lowered Alaskans in poverty by
20–40%  (with especially large gains for rural Indigenous households) . Despite fears that free income
could  discourage  work,  research  finds  no  negative  effect  on  employment  in  Alaska .  In  fact,  by
providing a universal capital income, the fund made Alaska one of the most income-equal states . The
dividend enjoys broad public support – 81% of Alaskans say  it improves their quality of life  – illustrating
how universal, transparent distribution builds political durability.
Another prominent SWF is  Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global , which invests the nation’s oil
revenues. As of 2025 it is the world’s largest sovereign fund at $1.7–$1.8 trillion  in assets , equivalent to
over $300,000 per Norwegian. While Norway’s fund doesn’t pay checks to individuals, it follows a strict
“fiscal rule” : the government may spend only around 3% of the fund’s value  annually (roughly equal to
the expected real return) on public services . In 2025, this sustainable drawdown will provide about
$50 billion  for Norway’s national budget  – effectively a shared national dividend financing education,
healthcare, and pensions for current and future generations. By investing abroad and limiting withdrawals,
Norway has avoided the “resource curse,” converting oil wealth into a perpetual endowment that upholds a
generous welfare state.
Several  countries  have  tried  direct  wealth-sharing  with  mixed  results.  Macao  (China) ,  a  casino-driven
economy, has since 2008 run a “Wealth Partaking Scheme”  that simply gives annual cash to all residents.
In 2024, each permanent resident received  MOP 10,000  (about  $1,250 ) and others MOP 6,000 .
Covering ~748,000 people, the payout totaled MOP 7.36 billion (>$900 million) . This scheme returns
excess casino-tax revenue to the public, bolstering consumption and living standards. On a smaller scale,
Bolivia  uses resource dividends for social policy: its Renta Dignidad  (started 2008) is a universal old-age
pension funded largely by natural gas revenues. It pays every Bolivian over 60 about  $50 per month12

(130 Bolivianos) . This stipend – roughly 20% of minimum wage – has achieved 91% pension coverage
(versus ~14% before)  and sharply cut poverty among the elderly, especially in rural areas .
Not all experiments have endured.  Mongolia  briefly implemented a “resource dividend” during a mining
boom. A Human Development Fund  was set up in 2009 to share new mining wealth; from 2010–2012 it
paid  monthly cash stipends to every citizen . At its peak, Mongolians received around  MNT 96,000
(~$34) quarterly as dividends . The universal payments – totaling nearly 3% of GDP in social transfers
– helped  cut poverty  even through economic downturns . However , when commodity prices fell, the
government  shifted  to  a  targeted  child  benefit  in  2012 ,  as  the  universal  scheme  became  fiscally
unsustainable . Similarly, Iran’s “Justice Shares”  program (mid-2000s) distributed shares of state-owned
companies to over 40 million citizens  to democratize privatization . Early on, dividends yielded about
$80 per person , and inequality dipped slightly . But many recipients lacked influence over corporate
governance, and dividend payouts later stalled . The lesson is that broad asset distribution alone isn’t
enough  – robust institutions are needed to generate and sustain returns for citizens.
State and Regional Ownership Initiatives
Subnational governments have also created participatory ownership systems. In the United States, North
Dakota’s state-owned bank  stands out. The Bank of North Dakota (BND) , founded in 1919, is the only
state  bank  in  the  country.  Mandated  to  promote  local  commerce  and  agriculture,  BND  partners  with
community  banks  to  expand  credit  and  returns  profits  to  the  public .  It  has  been  remarkably
successful: over 1996–2016, BND generated $1 billion in profits , and contributed nearly $400 million  of
that to North Dakota’s general budget (about $3,300 per household  in public revenues) . In recent years
it earned record profits (e.g. $192.7 million in 2023 , an 18% return on investment) . These earnings help
fund schools and infrastructure, essentially a shared dividend from a public financial enterprise. BND’s
model – professional management with a public mandate – has also kept local banks robust (ND has the
most local banks per capita in the U.S.) , illustrating how  public ownership can coexist with and
bolster private sector partners .
In Switzerland , each canton (state) often owns a cantonal bank  that returns profits to citizens indirectly via
government coffers. For example, the  Zürcher Kantonalbank (ZKB)  – 100% owned by Zurich’s cantonal
government – reported a CHF 1.29 billion pre-tax profit in 2024 . That year it distributed CHF 562 million
(≈$600 million)  of its surplus to the canton and municipalities . This included a  CHF 361 million
dividend to the canton  (supporting public services or tax relief) and CHF 170 million directly to local
municipalities . ZKB has for over 150 years provided such payments, proving that publicly owned banks
can be both profitable and socially beneficial . Across Switzerland, 24 cantonal banks  earned a
combined  CHF 3.4 billion profit in 2021 ; during COVID-19, cantons even pressed to continue bank
dividends to support budgets . This underscores a best practice: diverse, locally controlled assets (like
banks or utilities) can generate steady income streams for subnational governments .
Public wealth funds  exist at state/provincial levels too. Canada’s oil-rich Alberta created the Heritage Fund
in  1976,  which  at  times  paid  “prosperity  bonuses”  to  residents,  though  it  later  focused  on  saving  for
government use. In contrast, Brazil offers a modern example of a municipal sovereign fund  driving basic
income. The city of Maricá, Brazil  (pop. ~160,000) lies atop offshore oil fields and has earmarked royalties
for a  local citizen’s income . Since 2019, Maricá’s left-leaning government expanded a program called
Renda Básica da Cidadania  to reach  52,000 low-income residents  (about one-third of the city) .
Each enrolled resident receives  130 reais per month  (≈$64), roughly 75% of Brazil’s poverty line . A19

family of four would get over half the minimum wage from this stipend . Crucially, Maricá’s program is
permanent and funded by a dedicated revenue stream  – more than 60% of the city’s budget comes
from oil royalties , enabling stable payments without new taxes . The city even created a rainy-day
fund  (reserving 5% of royalties) and a public  community bank  that issues the stipend in a local digital
currency (the Mumbuca ) to boost local commerce . While not yet universal, the plan is to gradually
include all residents as the endowment grows . Maricá’s ongoing evaluation (with 5,000 recipients in a
study) is expected to yield insights on how a municipal basic income affects inflation, employment, and
well-being  in a middle-income city .
Resource-producing  regions  often  invest  in  community  trusts .  In  the  United  States,  several  Native
American tribal governments use communal ownership to share wealth. For instance, the Eastern Band of
Cherokee Indians  owns profitable casinos in North Carolina and distributes a large portion of gaming
profits  as  per-capita  cash  payments  to  all  tribal  members.  Approximately  16,000  Cherokee  citizens
receive around $12,000 each per year  (split into semiannual checks) . Such payments, ongoing since
the late 1990s, have halved poverty rates and improved health and education outcomes in the community
 (notably, researchers observed that steady “casino dividends” for Cherokee families corresponded with
better child development and lower crime in the region). Many other U.S. tribes and First Nations in Canada
similarly issue per-capita dividends from tribe-owned enterprises (casinos, oil leases, etc.), demonstrating
how  indigenous communities leverage collective assets to provide a basic income floor and social
benefits .
Community Land Trusts and Local Asset Sharing
At the local level, community land trusts (CLTs)  and similar vehicles allow collective ownership of land and
real estate to serve community needs. A CLT is typically a nonprofit trust that holds land in perpetuity to
ensure it’s used for affordable housing or community development. The largest example is the Champlain
Housing Trust (CHT)  in Vermont, USA. Founded in 1984 in Burlington, CHT now owns and manages ~2,400
rental  apartments  and  635  owner-occupied  homes  that  are  kept  permanently  affordable .  This
portfolio houses about  7,000 people  across three counties . The trust retains ownership of land and
uses resale restrictions so that when a family sells a CLT home, it gains some equity but the home remains
below market price for the next buyer . Empirical outcomes:  CHT’s model has helped low-income families
build modest wealth while preventing gentrification  – over the decades, hundreds of homes that would
have  escalated  in  price  instead  stayed  affordable  for  new  buyers.  Studies  show  CLT  homeowners  in
Burlington gain equity (through paid-down mortgages and a portion of appreciation) yet the housing costs
remain  ~25%  lower  than  market,  expanding  homeownership  access  without  perpetual  subsidies.  By
removing land from speculative markets, CLTs  stabilize neighborhoods and tax bases  long-term. Many
U.S. cities (and UK communities) have replicated this model for housing, commercial spaces, and even local
farms, using ground-leases and communal stewardship to generate community “dividends” in the form
of below-market rents, housing security, and retained local wealth .
Communities have also pioneered neighborhood-level investment trusts  akin to small-scale REITs (Real
Estate Investment Trusts). A notable case is the  East Portland Community Investment Trust (CIT)  in
Oregon, USA – a project that allowed ordinary residents to collectively buy a commercial property in their
neighborhood. In 2014, a nonprofit (Mercy Corps) acquired a blighted strip mall (Plaza 122) and then
offered local low-income households the chance to  buy shares for $10–$100 per month . Between 2017
and 2024,  328 residents became investor-owners  in this CIT . The trust used tenant rents to pay
expenses and distribute returns. Over five years, the CIT paid annual dividends averaging a 7.6% return46

to investors . By 2024 the share value nearly doubled from $10 to $19.65 , helping families
build savings. Investors could cash out for needs like home down-payments or education – indeed, 80
participants withdrew a total $146,000 for such goals . Equally important, the once half-empty Plaza
122 was revitalized: the trust upgraded the property and cut vacancy from 33% to under 10% , attracting
26 local businesses (many minority-owned) . The social impact  has been profound: participants report
feeling more empowered (“a wonderful way to feel connected to my community and to save money” says
one investor) and  90% reinvested each year . This  “neighborhood REIT” model  is now being
replicated in at least  19 other communities  with support from philanthropy . It shows that with the
right  legal  structure  and  financial  education  (CIT  required  an  investor  course  “Moving  from  Owing  to
Owning”), even families of modest means can become collective landlords – securing an  asset stake in
their neighborhood’s future development  and sharing the profits.
Cooperative Enterprises and Employee Ownership
Cooperatives  – enterprises owned and governed by their members – are a long-standing participatory
ownership form, spanning worker-owned firms, consumer co-ops, producer co-ops, and mutuals. One of
the  world’s  most  celebrated  examples  is  Spain’s  Mondragón  Corporation ,  a  federation  of  worker
cooperatives in the Basque region. Founded in 1956 in a poor rural area, Mondragón has grown into a
diversified  group  of  81  cooperatives  with  over  70,000  employee-owners .  Its  companies  span
manufacturing,  retail,  finance,  and  R&D,  collectively  generating  €10.6   billion  in  annual  revenue .
Mondragón’s governance embodies one-person-one-vote democracy and a solidarity ethos. The pay scale
is kept very equitable : the ratio between the highest and lowest salary is about 6:1 (versus 272:1  in large
US corporations) . At year-end, worker-members vote on profit distribution – typically allocating part to
worker bonuses  (profit shares) and part to collective reserves . Mondragón coop members receive a
base pay about  40% above Spain’s minimum wage  on average , plus annual profit dividends when
business is good. In hard times, they have innovated ways to save jobs – for example, cooperatives can
redeploy  workers  among  sister  firms  or  tap  a  mutual  support  fund.  This  was  tested  in  2013  when
Mondragón’s large appliance coop Fagor  went bankrupt; most displaced members were absorbed by other
coops, cushioning the blow. Mondragón’s mix of social responsibility and competitiveness  shows in its
global operations: it runs international factories and research centers, yet reinvests surpluses locally to
create  jobs  and  fund  education  (it  even  started  a  cooperative  university  that  co-trains  students  and
workers) .  The  co-op  also  contributes  to  regional  development  –  members  routinely  approve
allocations for community projects, charities, and preserving Basque culture . Empirically , Mondragón
has proven that large industrial firms can be worker-owned and still thrive in global markets. Its resilience is
notable: even amid Spain’s past recessions, Mondragón’s co-ops had significantly lower failure rates and
more  stable  employment  than  comparable  conventional  firms,  thanks  to  flexible  wages  and  internal
solidarity mechanisms. Key best practices include  transparent participatory governance, capped pay
inequality, reinvestment of profits, and cooperative networks for scale and innovation  – all of which
have sustained Mondragón for nearly 70 years.
Cooperative ownership can also succeed at regional economy scale . In Italy’s Emilia-Romagna  region, a
rich cooperative ecosystem has evolved over a century. Today about  8,100 cooperatives  operate in this
region of 4.5 million people , ranging from agriculture and retail co-ops to manufacturing and social
cooperatives. They account for roughly 30% of Emilia-Romagna’s GDP  – one of the highest co-op
densities in the world. In the city of Bologna, two out of three residents  are co-op members and cooperatives
produce an estimated 40% of local GDP . This extensive network (including large consumer co-ops that
dominate  grocery  retail,  and  construction  co-ops  that  rebuilt  cities  after  WWII)  correlates  with  better5756 5859

economic  outcomes :  Emilia-Romagna  has  lower  unemployment  and  higher  small-business  growth
than most other Italian regions . Co-ops in the region often federate into consortia for financing or
marketing, and Italian law (since the Marcora Act of 1985) even supports worker buyouts of failing firms by
forming cooperatives. The  Emilia-Romagna experience  highlights how  policy support and cooperative
culture can mainstream participatory ownership  – spreading risk and reward among many stakeholders
and anchoring wealth locally.
Employee ownership is not confined to formally cooperative companies. Many private firms use Employee
Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs)  or similar schemes to share equity with workers. In the United States,
ESOPs  have  expanded  considerably:  over  6,400  companies  have  ESOP  plans,  covering  10.1   million
employees  with $1.8 trillion in assets . The average ESOP participant holds $180,000  in stock wealth in
their company’s ESOP trust  – a substantial nest egg that is on top of wages. Studies show ESOP workers
typically enjoy equal or higher pay  than peers at non-ESOP firms, and often get additional benefits  like
profit-sharing  and  better  retirement  plans .  ESOP  companies  also  appear  to  be  more  stable  in
downturns; for example, during the 2008–09 recession, ESOP firms laid off employees at 1/3 to 1/2  the rate
of other firms, on average. This stability is attributed to higher employee engagement and the firms’ longer-
term outlook. However , ESOP adoption has grown only modestly (roughly 200–300 new plans per year in the
US ), partly due to complex regulations. Still, 18% of U.S. workers now have some ownership stake in
their  employer  via  ESOPs,  stock  grants,  or  cooperatives  –  indicating  a  significant  shift  toward
democratizing capital. In other countries like the UK, employee ownership trusts (EOTs) have similarly
enabled company founders to transfer ownership to employees (the John Lewis Partnership, a major UK
retailer with ~80,000 employees, has been employee-owned since 1929 and historically shared annual
profits as employee bonuses, though its payouts vary with performance).  Best practices for employee
ownership  include  providing  workers  with  real  decision-making  power  (not  just  stock),  education  on
financial literacy, and mechanisms to prevent excessive concentration of risk in workers’ portfolios.
Consumer cooperatives and credit unions  demonstrate participatory ownership for customers. Globally,
the cooperative movement counts over  1 billion members  across all types of co-ops. In finance alone,
credit unions worldwide now serve 411 million members  and hold $3.7 trillion in assets . Because
they are member-owned, credit unions typically offer better rates or patronage dividends. For example,
Canadian credit unions return profits to members as lower loan interest and annual rebate checks; in the
U.S., credit union members saw an average of $85 per capita in direct financial benefits in 2022 through
lower fees and higher savings yields. Likewise, large consumer co-ops (like Coop Switzerland or Japan’s Co-
op Kobe) distribute year-end patronage dividends proportional to members’ purchases. These models don’t
usually provide a livable income by themselves, but they recycle surplus value back to the community of
users ,  effectively  raising  disposable  income  and  aligning  services  with  community  needs.  Mutual
insurance companies  follow a similar model, often refunding premiums to policyholders when claims are
lower than expected.
Resource Commons and Environmental Trusts
Innovative ownership models are emerging to manage  natural commons  – from land and forests to
carbon emissions – for shared benefit. A contemporary example can be seen in community-managed
carbon offset projects that generate revenue through  carbon credits  and share it locally. In  Kenya , the
small towns of Gazi Bay and Makongeni created Mikoko Pamoja  (Swahili for “Mangroves Together”), the
world’s  first  community-led  blue  carbon  project .  Established  in  2013,  Mikoko  Pamoja  protects
615 hectares of mangrove forest  and sells the carbon sequestration as offsets on the voluntary market76

. Each year it generates about 3,000 carbon credits  (≈2,500 tons CO₂) for sale . Income from
these credit sales – over $25,000 per year – flows directly back to the two villages . Rather than
individual payouts, the community collectively decides on local development projects. Thus far , Mikoko
Pamoja funds have built  clean water wells (boreholes)  serving hundreds of schoolchildren, improved
school  facilities,  and  supported  fishing  livelihoods .  This  model  effectively  turns  global  carbon
finance  into  a  local  shared  dividend  for  conservation:  villagers  earn  community-wide  benefits  (water
infrastructure, education, jobs) as a reward for stewarding the carbon-rich mangroves. It has also bolstered
local incomes (through paid roles in replanting and monitoring) and won international acclaim as a best-
practice in equitable climate action . Similar carbon benefit-sharing schemes  are underway elsewhere
– e.g. indigenous forest communities in the Amazon and Congo basins receive portions of REDD+ carbon
payments, often via community trust funds for health and education projects. The key lesson is that when
local  stakeholders  have  ownership  stakes  in  environmental  assets ,  they  become  partners  in
sustainability. Ensuring transparent benefit-sharing (whether via cash stipends, community services, or
resource rights) is crucial to align economic incentives with conservation.
Communities have also organized to own renewable energy assets  together . Nowhere has this been more
apparent  than  in  Germany’s  Energiewende  (energy  transition) .  Policy  enabled  citizens,  co-ops,  and
farmers  to  invest  in  solar  panels,  wind  turbines,  and  bioenergy  –  often  collectively.  By  2016,  private
individuals owned 31.5% of Germany’s renewable power capacity  (the single largest ownership group),
with  farmers  owning  another  10.5% .  In  other  words,  over  42%  of  Germany’s  100   GW  of
renewables was community-owned . In wind energy specifically, local citizen cooperatives and
partnerships owned an estimated 39% of wind capacity . Tens of thousands of Germans joined energy
cooperatives  (Energiegenossenschaften)  –  over  1,000  such  co-ops  had  formed  by  2016,  counting
180,000+ members  who pooled capital for wind farms, solar parks, or district heating networks .
These energy co-ops typically offer modest but reliable returns: a survey of 850 co-ops found an average
annual  dividend  of  3.4%  to  members ,  with  many  co-ops  reinvesting  profits  in  new  projects.  The
average citizen investor put in about €3,700, with minimum shares as low as €10–€100 so that even those of
limited means could participate . Besides direct dividends, the social dividends  have been substantial –
local ownership built public support for renewables (“Not in my backyard” turned into “build it in our
backyard, we’ll profit”) and kept economic benefits local. Studies show regions with cooperatively owned
wind projects see higher local acceptance and more spending retained in the community , compared to
developer-owned projects. Denmark saw a similar phenomenon: in the 1980s–90s, government required
new wind turbines to offer shares to local residents, resulting in thousands of Danish families co-owning
windmills. By 2001, an estimated 86% of Denmark’s wind capacity was locally owned , often via co-ops,
which greatly normalized wind farms in the landscape. Although the energy industry has since consolidated
(Germany’s citizen share has declined from ~47% in 2012 as utilities and funds invest more ), the
early  majority-citizen  ownership  of  renewables  in  Germany  and  Denmark  demonstrates  how
participatory models can rapidly scale a new technology while spreading its financial gains widely.
Best Practices and Governance Insights
Across  these  diverse  cases  –  from  national  wealth  funds  to  neighborhood  trusts  –  several  common
principles  emerge for effective participatory ownership:
Clear Purpose and Rules:  Successful models have well-defined missions and legal frameworks that
prioritize long-term common benefit. Alaska’s fund enshrined a permanent mineral revenue share
for citizens , and Norway’s fund set strict caps on spending . This guards against political8283 84

whims or elite capture. Clarity that assets are held in trust for future generations or community
welfare  builds legitimacy.
Professional  Management,  Democratic  Oversight:  The  most  resilient  examples  blend  strong
governance with popular participation. Norway’s and Alaska’s funds are managed by investment
professionals  at  arm’s  length  from  politicians,  but  their  payouts  (or  spending  rules)  are  set  by
democratic mandate. Mondragón’s co-ops compete in markets with professional management, but
strategic decisions and profit allocations are voted on by worker-members . This balance ensures
both efficiency and accountability .
Broad Inclusion:  The impact on equity and social cohesion is greatest when participation is broad-
based. Universal or wide eligibility (all residents, all workers, etc.) avoids stigmatizing beneficiaries
and secures broad buy-in. The APF dividend’s universality is key to its 80%+ approval . Emilia-
Romagna’s co-op sector involves two-thirds of citizens . Inclusive models also tend to have more
staying power  (it’s hard to retract benefits that most people receive).
Reinvestment  and  Education:  Many  participatory  ventures  devote  part  of  returns  to  capacity-
building. Co-ops often reinvest profits in expansion or community education (Mondragón runs its
own university; German energy co-ops reinvested to grow 2.5 GW of projects by 2017 ). Programs
like the Portland CIT provided mandatory financial education, empowering participants to make the
most of their ownership .  Human capital and financial literacy  are crucial to maximize the
social impact of shared ownership.
Shielding  Wealth  for  Public  Benefit:  A  frequent  challenge  is  preventing  the  privatization  or
dissipation of the common asset. Best practices include legal locks or incentives to keep assets in
trust. Community land trusts employ ground leases to retain land ownership. Many co-ops (e.g. in
Italy) have “indivisible reserves” that can’t be cashed out if the co-op dissolves – they must transfer to
another co-op, preserving cooperative capital for public good. Alaska’s constitution bars spending
the Permanent Fund principal, allowing only earnings as dividends. These mechanisms ensure the
wealth fund or common asset remains intact  to serve multiple generations.
Fair Distribution Mechanisms:  Whether distributing cash or services, transparent formulas build
trust. Alaska’s dividend is a simple equal per-person payout – seen as fair and easy to administer .
Cherokee  casino  payments  are  equal  per  capita  (with  minors’  shares  held  in  trust).  In  co-ops,
patronage dividends proportional to one’s transactions or labor contribution are common, perceived
as just. Transparency  in accounting and distribution prevents perceptions of favoritism and secures
long-term support.
Complementary Institutions:  Participatory ownership works best within a supportive ecosystem of
policies and institutions. Germany’s citizen energy boom was enabled by feed-in tariffs  (guaranteed
payment for renewable generation)  and accessible cooperative legal forms . ESOPs thrive
with tax incentives and employee training programs. In Preston, UK, a recent “community wealth
building” initiative saw the city government prioritize procurement from co-ops and local ESOP firms,
boosting their success. In short, aligning public policy (tax, subsidy, procurement, legal codes) with
participatory ownership amplifies its impact.•

Adaptability and Risk Management:  Some experiments failed or needed adjustments – providing
lessons in what to avoid. Mongolia’s universal dividends proved unsustainable when they outpaced
resource revenues , highlighting the need for prudent reserve management. Iran’s Justice Shares
showed that simply handing out shares without giving new owners voice or liquidity can limit impact
. Modern proposals for “social wealth funds” suggest giving citizens not just assets but also
representation  in  fund  governance  to  avoid  such  pitfalls.  Many  co-ops  have  stumbled  when
expanding  beyond  their  participatory  culture  (e.g.  some  demutualized,  like  the  UK’s  building
societies in the 1980s, which led to short-term windfalls but long-term loss of member control).
Governance structures must evolve  as scale grows – for example, Mondragón had to institute
complex federation rules and secondary co-ops (for finance, R&D, social security) to manage an
enterprise of 70,000 worker-owners.
In a post-labor  future – where capital ownership may matter more for distribution than jobs – these models
provide proven architectures for shared prosperity . From Alaska to Maricá, Basel to Kerala (where India’s
largest co-op bank and worker collectives flourish), communities have shown that democratizing ownership
can  reduce  inequality,  strengthen  social  cohesion,  and  give  people  a  stake  in  the  economy’s  future.
Participatory ownership models work at all scales:  national funds can endow every citizen with a basic
dividend, while neighborhood co-ops can anchor wealth on a single block. The  most effective systems
blend public and private ingenuity  – for instance, a public trust fund investing in private markets but
paying a social dividend, or a hybrid public-coop partnership (as seen when German municipalities partner
with citizen co-ops on energy projects ).
As  we  plan  for  a  century  in  which  labor’s  share  may  continue  to  shrink ,  scaling  up  these
participatory  ownership  mechanisms  will  be  critical.  They  offer  a  path  to  “widely  shared  and
democratically  governed”  wealth ,  mitigating  the  risks  of  automation  and  inequality  by  ensuring
everyone – workers, residents, and future generations – owns a piece of the value created . The rich global
experience of the last 100 years suggests that with prudent governance, transparency, and inclusive design,
participatory ownership can deliver not only economic dividends, but also greater civic engagement and
