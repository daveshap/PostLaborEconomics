Evolution of Social Contracts: From Ancient
Kingdoms to Modern Nation-States
Introduction
The term  social contract  broadly refers to an implicit or explicit agreement between the governed and
their  rulers,  defining  mutual  rights  and  duties .  Throughout  history,  political  communities  have
developed diverse social contracts underpinned by foundational promises  (such as security, prosperity, or
justice) and legitimizing myths  (religious or ideological narratives that justify authority). These contracts
have  never  been  static  –  they  evolved  across  time  and  cultures ,  responding  to  social  pressures  and
technological change. From the ritual legitimacy of ancient monarchies to the rights-based compacts of
modern  democracies,  each  era’s  social  contract  reflects  its  unique  context.  Crucially,  periods  of  major
technological innovation – agrarian, industrial, communications, surveillance, digital – have disrupted old
arrangements and  afforded  new political possibilities, forcing renegotiation of the social contract. When
elites failed to adapt (for example, the Russian imperial regime clinging to autocracy in an industrializing
age),  breakdowns  such as revolutions or collapses often ensued . By contrast, strategic adaptations
(such  as  expanding  welfare  and  voting  rights  in  20th-century  democracies)  often  averted  unrest  and
renewed legitimacy. This report provides an exhaustive historical analysis of how social contracts have
evolved from antiquity to the present, examining cases from  Ancient Greece and Imperial China to
Enlightenment Europe and contemporary Western and Eastern models . We trace how each society’s
core bargain – whether emphasizing labor rights, property rights, or democratic rights  – was shaped by
its environment, and how new technologies altered the balance of power between state and society. We
also analyze critical failures of the social contract (e.g. revolutions, the Great Leap Forward) to draw lessons
about maladaptive trajectories. Throughout, our focus is on identifying patterns and strategic insights  that
can inform modern policy: how can governments today renegotiate social contracts in the face of digital
transformation,  economic  upheaval,  and  shifting  public  expectations?  The  narrative  is  organized  both
thematically  and  chronologically,  with  sections  highlighting  key  periods  and  transitions.  Tables  and
diagrams  are  included  to  illustrate  typologies  of  social  contracts  and  the  transitions  between  them.
Ultimately, understanding the evolution of social contracts is vital to crafting durable and just governance
arrangements in the 21st century.
Foundations of the Social Contract: Myth, Consent, and Obligation
Human societies have long grappled with the question of what grants rulers the right to govern and why
people accept authority. Millennia before Enlightenment philosophers formalized “social contract theory,”
earlier cultures developed  de facto  social contracts grounded in religion, tradition, or pragmatic mutual
benefit. This section explores the foundational forms of social contracts in the ancient and classical world –
ranging from the god-king doctrines of Mesopotamia and Egypt, through the civic philosophies of Greece,
to the Confucian moral order of China. We examine how legitimizing myths  (like divine right or Mandate of
Heaven) established rulers’ authority  and set expectations for their performance. Even in the absence of
formal democratic consent, these frameworks created an  implicit contract : subjects owed loyalty and
tribute,  while  rulers  were  obliged  (at  least  in  principle)  to  ensure  cosmic  order ,  justice,  or  prosperity.1

Moreover , seeds of the modern idea of consensual governance can be traced to antiquity. Greek thinkers,
for example, posited that society arose from agreements among individuals – a notion echoed by Sophists
and dramatized in Plato’s dialogues . In short, the ancient foundations of social contracts combined
mystical authority and proto-contractarian ideas , setting the stage for later , more explicit theories of
consent.
Divine Kingship and Justice in Early Civilizations
In the earliest agrarian civilizations, social order was often framed as a covenant between the ruler , the
gods,  and  the  people.  Mesopotamian  and  Egyptian  kingdoms  elevated  their  rulers  to  a  quasi-divine
status, claiming that kings were either gods themselves or chosen by gods to maintain order . This belief was
not mere superstition; it performed a social function by legitimizing centralized authority  in the face of
human insecurity. For example, the Code of Hammurabi  (c. 1754 BCE) – one of the oldest legal codes – opens
by declaring that the gods appointed King Hammurabi “to bring about the rule of righteousness in the
land… [and] to prevent the strong from oppressing the weak” . This reveals an implicit social contract:
Hammurabi’s right to rule rested on a promise to deliver justice and protection for the vulnerable. Similarly,
in Pharaonic Egypt, the concept of maat  (cosmic order and justice) was central – the Pharaoh was expected
to uphold maat  by ensuring the Nile’s fertility and the realm’s prosperity, in return for which his subjects
obeyed  and  revered  him.  While  ordinary  people  in  these  societies  had  no  formal  political  voice,  the
foundational myth  was that good governance was divinely mandated. If famine, chaos, or oppression
reigned, it could be interpreted as a breach of the cosmic contract, potentially justifying rebellion or the rise
of a new dynasty blessed by the gods. In this way, even absolutist ancient regimes were constrained by a
kind of social contract: a moral economy  of rule where the king’s legitimacy hinged on delivering the basic
goods of life (justice, sustenance, security) as ordained by higher powers.
Civic Participation in the Classical Greek Polis
Ancient Greece introduced more explicit notions of human-originated social contracts, especially in its
democratic and philosophical traditions. The Greek city-states ( poleis ) were small, face-to-face societies
where political order often depended on active citizen participation  rather than distant divine sanction. In
Athens , for example, the governing myth was not a god-king but the idea of isonomia  (equality under law)
and the notion that citizens collectively deliberated their laws. In practice, Athenian democracy in the 5th
century BCE involved a social contract among a limited citizenry: male citizens had the right to vote in the
assembly and serve in public office, and in exchange they were expected to fulfill civic duties such as
military service and jury duty. Philosophically, Greek thinkers began to formalize social contract ideas. The
Sophist tradition argued that justice and law were human constructs (rather than divine gifts), arising from
agreements to mutual advantage . Plato’s  Crito  provides a famous anecdote: Socrates, in jail awaiting
execution, personifies the Laws of Athens explaining that by choosing to live in Athens, one has implicitly
agreed to its laws as part of a social contract, and thus must accept even unjust outcomes rather than
undermine the legal order . This early articulation of tacit consent  – the idea that continued residence or
participation  implies  agreement  to  a  polity’s  rules  –  shows  that  by  the  4th  century  BCE  Greeks  were
consciously reflecting on the contract between the individual and the city-state. Furthermore, Aristotle  and
others discussed the role of constitutions ( politeia ) as arrangements reflecting a people’s way of life, hinting
that stable governance rested on some alignment (contract) between rulers and the ruled. While Greek city-
states were far from modern liberal democracies (e.g. women, slaves, and foreigners had no political rights
in Athens), the Hellenic world bequeathed the revolutionary notion that legitimacy could flow from human
agreements and rational debate  about the common good, not solely from divine will or tradition. This3

was a vital intellectual precursor to later social contract theories that put consent and rational self-interest
at the heart of political legitimacy .
Imperial China’s Mandate of Heaven: A Contract of Virtue and Prosperity
In parallel to Western antiquity,  Imperial China  developed its own powerful vision of the social contract
grounded in morality and performance – the Mandate of Heaven  (Tiānmìng ). Established during the Zhou
Dynasty (c. 1046 BCE), this doctrine held that Heaven conferred the right to rule on an emperor (the “Son of
Heaven”) only so long as he governed virtuously and ensured the welfare of his people . Crucially,
the Mandate was conditional: natural disasters, invasions, or widespread suffering were interpreted as
signs that the emperor had lost Heaven’s favor through misrule . In Chinese political culture, this
amounted to an implicit social contract between ruler and ruled  that persisted for over two millennia.
The foundational promise  was that the emperor would maintain harmony, justice, and prosperity; in return,
the people owed him loyalty and obedience. If the ruler failed catastrophically – evidenced by famine,
corruption, or military defeat – the people not only could  revolt, but in fact ought to , as successful rebellion
proved  that  Heaven  had  withdrawn  its  mandate .  As  a  contemporary  analyst  notes,  “the  Chinese
mandate of heaven was not a God-given right; the people’s acceptance of the rulers’ legitimacy rested on
the condition that the rulers had to perform” . This idea functioned as a safety valve in Chinese history:
while day-to-day governance was autocratic, the Mandate myth set an expectation of benevolent governance
and provided moral cover for periodic regime change. Confucian philosophy reinforced this contractarian
nuance. Confucius taught that a ruler must be like a father to his people – virtuous and caring – and warned
that “water can carry a boat but also overturn it,” meaning the populace’s support, while empowering, could
also topple a tyrant . Thus Chinese scholars saw good governance as the basis of legitimacy and popular
rebellion  as  justified  if  governance  was  egregiously  bad .  In  modern  terms,  Imperial  China’s  social
contract was a performance-based legitimacy model : it lacked Western-style individual rights or formal
consent, but it recognized public well-being  as the bedrock of authority. Notably, this model resonates even
today  –  the  Chinese  Communist  Party  (CCP)  often  claims  a  secular  “mandate”  based  on  delivering
economic growth and national strength, a narrative directly descended from the ancient concept . In
summary, through the Mandate of Heaven, traditional China conceptualized governance as a reciprocal
moral  duty:  the  emperor’s  divine-right  status  was  tethered  to  his  fulfillment  of  social  responsibilities,
anticipating by millennia the social contract idea that political legitimacy is conditional  on meeting the needs
of the governed.
Illustration: The dynastic cycle in Chinese history, depicting how the Mandate of Heaven  legitimizes a new ruler
who brings peace and prosperity, which leads to population growth and corruption over time, eventually resulting
in disasters and rebellion that usher in a new dynasty. This cycle reflects an implicit social contract: the ruler’s
mandate is contingent on good governance, and loss of virtue or failure to protect the people voids the contract ,
justifying revolt .
The Roman Republic and Empire: Legalism, Citizenship, and “Bread and Circuses”
No survey of early social contracts is complete without noting the Roman experience, which bridges the gap
between Greek civic ideals and later imperial governance. The Roman Republic (509–27 BCE) , like Greek
city-states, was built on a concept of shared civic responsibility (among the patrician and later plebeian
classes) through a complex constitution of checks and balances. Romans cherished the idea of  libertas
(freedom under law) and developed formal mechanisms – such as the Twelve Tables  (first written laws) and
elected magistracies – that functioned as a contractual structure. The Roman motto  Senatus Populusque5

Romanus  (The Senate and People of Rome) symbolized that sovereignty was a joint venture between rulers
(the Senate/consuls) and the people (assemblies), albeit an unequal one. Over time, plebeians won the right
to tribunes and veto power , essentially expanding the social contract to include protections for commoners’
rights within the republic’s framework. However , as Rome transitioned into the Roman Empire , the social
contract took on a different character . Emperors claimed authority through a mix of legal continuity (they
were styled as “first citizens” with tribunician power) and quasi-divine status (the imperial cult). Lacking
formal accountability to the populace, Roman emperors relied on a pragmatic contract: provide “bread and
circuses”  – grain doles and entertainment – and maintain peace (the  Pax Romana ), in exchange for the
people’s acquiescence . The Roman social contract thus shifted from the Republican model of shared
governance to an Imperial model of  mass clientelism : the emperor’s legitimacy rested on securing the
army’s loyalty and keeping the urban masses satisfied materially. When emperors failed to do so (as in
times of economic crisis, military defeat, or misrule), legitimacy waned and they were often overthrown by
revolts or assassinations. This dynamic was evident in the Crisis of the Third Century (235–284 CE) , when a
breakdown of imperial authority amid plagues and invasions led to usurpers and civil wars. The Roman case
underlines a pattern seen across many cultures: as polities grow large and complex, social contracts may
become  more  paternalistic  (citizens  as  wards  expecting  benefits  rather  than  active  participants),  and
stability hinges on the ruler’s ability to deliver concrete benefits (food, security) to the people. Rome’s
eventual  adoption  of  Christianity  added  a  new  legitimizing  myth  (Divine  Providence  favoring  Christian
emperors), but even that religious narrative did not fundamentally alter the underlying contract – the
legitimacy of late Roman and Byzantine rulers still depended on performance  (victory over enemies, internal
order) and the perception of divine favor , much like the Mandate of Heaven in China . In sum, the
Roman world experimented with both republican and authoritarian  social contracts, offering a legacy of
legalism  and  citizenship  that  would  later  inform  Enlightenment  thinkers,  while  also  exemplifying  how
autocratic regimes maintain consent through a mix of material provision and spectacle.
Medieval Feudalism: Hierarchy, Oaths, and Customary Contracts
With the collapse of centralized empires in the West, the Medieval period  (circa 5th–15th centuries) saw a
different kind of social contract emerge in Europe: feudalism . Lacking a strong state, the feudal order was
built on  personal oaths and obligations  that bound lords and vassals in a web of loyalty. This was, in
effect, a decentralized social contract: a lord provided land (a fief) and protection to his vassals; in return,
the vassal swore fealty and promised military service or labor . Similarly, peasants (serfs) were tied to the
lord’s land – they owed rent or labor , and the lord owed them the right to live on the land and protection
from marauders. These arrangements were often formalized in sworn ceremonies, indicating that even in a
highly stratified society, mutual obligation  was the currency of legitimacy. Feudal monarchs, for their part,
ruled not by populist mandate but by hereditary right tempered by custom . Yet, medieval kings were far
from absolute in practice – their rule depended on the consent of the nobility and the Church , each of
which had its own liberties. For instance, the Catholic Church anointed kings (giving divine legitimacy) but
also expected them to govern as Christian princes and respect ecclesiastical independence, effectively a
church–state contract . A landmark moment in codifying feudal contracts was the Magna Carta  (1215) in
England. Angry at King John’s abuses, the barons forced him to seal this charter , which compelled the king
to recognize certain rights of his subjects (primarily the nobility) and accepted that even the sovereign was
bound by law . Magna Carta’s clauses – such as that no free man could be punished except through the law
of the land – established that the king had a duty to govern lawfully and justly, arguably the embryo of a
social contract that the ruler’s power is not arbitrary. Historians note that Magna Carta asserted a form
of social contract  by limiting royal authority in favor of feudal rights, setting a precedent that rulers must
honor agreed constraints . Across medieval Europe, similar compacts existed (e.g. the  Golden Bull  of16
17 7
18

1222 in Hungary, or the Cortes  in Iberia where kings swore to uphold local privileges). These illustrate how
legitimizing myths  (like divine right  in medieval rhetoric) were in practice checked by customary contracts
– unwritten understandings that kings should “keep counsel” with their lords and rule in accordance with
the realm’s laws and traditions. When medieval monarchs violated these unwritten contracts (through
tyranny or heavy taxation), they often faced rebellion or civil war as a result. Thus, even in an age of
hierarchy  and  limited  freedoms,  the  principle  emerged  that  stable  governance  required  a  balance  of
obligation: protection and justice from above, loyalty and service from below . This feudal social contract was
narrow (excluding serfs and commoners from high politics) and unequal, but it laid groundwork for later
demands that rulers be accountable to agreed rules – a crucial step in the evolution toward constitutional
social contracts.
The Rise of Absolutism and the “Divine Right of Kings”
The late medieval and early modern era (16th–17th centuries) saw monarchs in Europe consolidate power ,
giving rise to absolutist states . To justify unchecked royal authority, the doctrine of the “Divine Right of
Kings”  emerged. According to this doctrine, the monarch derives legitimacy directly from God, not from any
contract with the people . King James I of England (r . 1603–1625), for example, famously wrote that kings
are “little gods” on Earth, accountable only to God . Under divine-right theory, obedience to the king was
a religious duty, and any rebellion was a sin. This  legitimizing myth  sought to supplant the medieval
contractual view with one of unilateral authority. The French Bishop Bossuet articulated around 1700 that
the king’s person is sacred and his power absolute, like a father’s authority over a family . This ideology
was used by Louis XIV of France (“L’État, c’est moi”) to centralize governance and by other monarchs to resist
concessions to parliaments or estates. Notably,  divine right absolutism rejected the very notion of a
social contract  with subjects – the king was said to be above human law and owed nothing but good
governance as defined by his conscience and God . However , even as absolutism peaked, it sowed the
seeds of backlash. In England, the Stuart kings’ pretensions to divine right provoked the English Civil War
(1640s)  and  ultimately  the  Glorious  Revolution  of  1688 ,  which  decisively  refuted  divine  right  by
establishing that the monarch ruled with Parliament’s consent. Thinkers like John Locke  attacked Sir Robert
Filmer’s divine-right theories by arguing for a contractarian basis of government. Locke’s  First Treatise of
Government  (1689) was a direct rebuttal of Filmer’s biblical claims of Adam’s hereditary kingship . Locke
and others insisted that legitimate authority must  rest on the governed’s consent and the protection of their
natural  rights,  not  on  mystical  appointment.  The  result  of  these  conflicts  was  a  gradual
constitutionalization  of monarchy in some places. For example, after 1688 the English monarch could no
longer  suspend  laws  or  levy  taxes  without  Parliament  –  effectively  a  contractual  agreement  that
government would be a partnership between crown and people’s representatives. In France and elsewhere,
absolutism  held  longer ,  but  even  there  the  idea  of  a  king’s  absolute  mandate  was  eroded  by  the
Enlightenment. By the late 18th century, the  divine right doctrine had “virtually disappeared” from
mainstream politics  in the West , discredited by events like the American and French revolutions which
explicitly grounded government legitimacy in the nation’s will. Absolutism’s rise and fall demonstrate a
crucial transition: the  rejection of one-sided, divinely-sanctioned contracts  in favor of the notion that
there are earthly checks  on rulers – whether legal, institutional, or popular . It highlighted the enduring truth
that a social contract perceived as entirely unaccountable is prone to crisis. Indeed, the revolutions that
ended the era of divine-right monarchs can be seen as violent renegotiations of the social contract, driven
by populations no longer willing to accept a bargain that gave them duties but no rights.19

Enlightenment Europe and the Social Contract of Liberal
Democracy
By the 17th and 18th centuries, European political thought underwent a revolution that placed the social
contract front and center . Enlightenment philosophers explicitly theorized how and why individuals form
societies  and  governments,  developing  the  classic  social  contract  theories  associated  with  Thomas
Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau . These theories fundamentally challenged older notions
of authority (divine right, tradition) by proposing that  legitimate government is grounded in rational
agreement and the consent of the governed . At the same time, these ideas did not remain merely on
paper – they inspired real-world political transformations. The  American Revolution (1776)  and  French
Revolution (1789)  were directly influenced by social contract ideals and produced written constitutions that
attempted to enact those ideals. This section explores how Enlightenment Europe redefined the social
contract around concepts of natural rights, popular sovereignty, and constitutional government , and
how those ideas were implemented in the founding of modern liberal democracies. We will see that the
Enlightenment social contract centered on a triad of rights – life (or labor), liberty (including democratic
participation), and property – which were asserted as fundamental and inalienable. These developments
represent a dramatic widening of the social contract: from protecting elite privileges to guaranteeing (in
principle)  the  rights  of  every  citizen ,  thereby  legitimizing  government  as  the  protector  of  common
interests. However , even as these ideals spread, tensions and exclusions remained (e.g. slavery, women’s
disenfranchisement), requiring further evolution in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau: Redefining the Social Contract
The  intellectual  scaffolding  of  modern  politics  was  erected  by  the  great  social  contract  philosophers.
Thomas Hobbes  set the stage with Leviathan  (1651), written amid the English Civil War . Hobbes posited a
hypothetical “state of nature” where life was unbearably insecure – “solitary, poor , nasty, brutish, and short”
– due to constant war of each against all . To escape this, individuals collectively agreed (the social
contract) to surrender their autonomous power to an absolute sovereign, who would enforce peace and
security . Hobbes’s version of the contract justified strong authority (even a monarchy) but crucially
based it on  secular, rational consent  rather than divine ordination . In Hobbes’s view, obedience is
owed because the alternative is a return to chaos; nonetheless, the sovereign’s legitimacy is conditional on
their maintaining order – if the Leviathan fails to protect lives, the contract is broken and society dissolves
back into a state of war (though Hobbes thought this scenario unlikely if power is undivided) . Next
came  John Locke , whose  Second Treatise of Government  (1690) shifted the contract to a foundation of
natural rights . Locke imagined a state of nature where people have rights to life, liberty, and property, but
lack an impartial authority to adjudicate disputes . Thus, people form a government through contract to
better secure those natural rights, delegating to rulers  limited  powers. Locke’s groundbreaking assertion
was that  the obligation to obey government is conditional upon the protection of each person’s
natural rights, including property . If a government violates the terms – becoming tyrannical or failing
to uphold rights – the people are “justifiably overthrown” in Locke’s framework . This was a radical
endorsement of the  right of revolution  as part of the social contract, directly challenging doctrines of
absolute monarchy. Locke thus articulated a key principle of liberalism:  no subjection to power without
consent ,  and  the  purpose  of  power  is  the  public  good  and  rights  protection .  Finally,  Jean-Jacques
Rousseau  in The Social Contract  (1762) took a more communitarian turn. He famously began, “Man is born
free, and everywhere he is in chains,” decrying how society’s institutions enslave the individual. Rousseau
argued that true legitimacy comes from the general will  of the people: in an ideal contract, each person
gives up all their rights to the community as a whole, and in return becomes an equal participant in3

sovereign decision-making. The general will (the collective interest) then governs, and obeying the law is
obeying oneself as a member of the polity. Rousseau’s concept was essentially direct democracy – a vision
that the social contract could create a morally transformative “civil state” where freedom and authority
coincide  because  laws  are  self-imposed  by  citizens.  This  theory  strongly  influenced  the  French
revolutionaries  with  its  notions  of  popular  sovereignty  and  equality .  Despite  their  differences,  what
distinguished all these Enlightenment theories was the idea of grounding political authority in human
agreement  and  rational  justification .  They  systematically  delineated  under  what  conditions  a
government  is  legitimate  (only  when  based  on  consent  and  securing  interests  of  the  governed)  and
illegitimate (when it oppresses or fails the people). These theories secularized and universalized the social
contract: rather than applying to a specific king and his nobles, the contract now was between all members
of society  and could be applied to all humanity in principle. Notably, these philosophers wrote not in a
vacuum but reacting to their times – Hobbes to civil war , Locke to the Glorious Revolution, Rousseau to the
inequities of ancien régime France. Their ideas became intellectual ammunition for political movements
that fundamentally altered social contracts in practice, as we explore next.
The Atlantic Revolutions: Social Contract Ideals in Action
The late 18th century was an era of revolution on both sides of the Atlantic, where Enlightenment social
contract ideals leapt off the page into constitutions and declarations. In the American Revolution (1775–
1783) ,  colonial  leaders  justified  independence  from  Britain  by  invoking  Locke’s  principles.  The  United
States Declaration of Independence (1776)  explicitly states that governments derive “their just powers
from the consent of the governed” and that people have a right to alter or abolish a government that
becomes destructive of their fundamental rights (life, liberty, pursuit of happiness – a nod to Locke’s triad)
. This was a direct application of the social contract theory: King George III was accused of breaching
the  contract  by  violating  colonists’  rights,  thus  absolving  them  of  allegiance.  The  subsequent  U.S.
Constitution  (1787)  instituted  a  government  based  on  popular  sovereignty,  with  elaborate  checks  and
balances to secure liberty and property – essentially a codified social contract among the states and people.
Meanwhile, across the ocean, the  French Revolution (1789)  took social contract theory to more radical
heights. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789)  declared that “Men are born and
remain  free  and  equal  in  rights”  and  that  “the  principle  of  all  sovereignty  resides  essentially  in  the
nation” . This was a sharp rebuke to divine-right monarchy: sovereignty now emanated from the
people, and no individual or group could lawfully exercise authority unless it flowed from the nation’s
consent .  The  Declaration  also  guaranteed  natural  and  civil  rights  –  property,  liberty,  security,  and
“resistance to oppression” – enshrining the idea that the state exists to protect these rights, not to grant
them as favors . In Rousseau’s spirit, it endorsed the general will as the basis of law, stating that law is
the expression of the general will of the citizens. The new French constitution attempted to implement
these principles (though the revolution would go through turmoil and multiple constitutions). Importantly,
the  French  Revolution  confronted  head-on  the  clash  between  political  equality  and  emerging  social
demands.  In  1793–94,  more  radical  factions  even  advocated  for  economic  rights  (like  the  right  to
subsistence), hinting at a broader social contract beyond property rights – an idea that would reappear later
in  socialist  thought.  The  Enlightenment-era  revolutions  demonstrated  the  power  of  social  contract
mythology to mobilize people. Kings were no longer seen as metaphysically superior; they were effectively
contractors , revocable if they broke faith with the people. Though it took violent struggle, by the early 19th
century divine-right absolutism was largely vanquished in the West. Even where monarchies persisted
(Britain, Prussia, etc.), they gradually conceded to constitutional frameworks acknowledging some role of
the governed. In summary, the late 18th century marked the transformation of the social contract from
theory  to  praxis :  entire  nations  were  re-founded  on  the  premise  of  consent  and  rights.  This  was  a5
31

profound enlargement of who counted in the contract (at least all propertied men at first) and what it
promised  (not  just  order ,  but  protection  of  individual  freedoms  and  private  property).  However ,  the
inclusivity of these new contracts was still limited – women, enslaved people, indigenous peoples, and the
propertyless often remained outside the “circle of we.” The stage was set for the 19th and 20th centuries to
democratize the social contract further , extending it to those previously excluded and grappling with new
demands for social and economic justice as industrialization changed the world.
The Industrial Revolution and the Expansion of the Social Contract
The 19th century’s  Industrial Revolution  radically transformed economies and societies, creating new
social classes and new political pressures. As agrarian life gave way to factory labor and urbanization, the
existing social contracts in Western nations – which had been designed largely for agrarian, small-scale
societies – came under immense strain. The industrial era introduced a mass  working class  (proletariat)
whose  harsh  conditions  and  demands  for  rights  could  not  be  ignored.  Meanwhile,  the  middle  class
(bourgeoisie) that had benefited from liberal revolutions now sought political empowerment commensurate
with their economic power . These shifts forced a renegotiation of the social contract on multiple fronts:
labor rights  (to address exploitation in the workplace),  property rights  (to adjust to capitalist dynamics
and rising inequality), and democratic rights  (to include the voices of the broader populace in governance).
Western social contracts thus underwent a series of adaptations through the 19th and early 20th centuries
– often contentious and crisis-driven – to accommodate industrial society. Key developments included the
extension of suffrage (first to all men, later to women), the legalization of trade unions and the recognition
of workers’ rights, and the birth of the welfare state providing social insurance. In parallel, alternative social
contract  models  emerged  in  response  to  industrial  capitalism’s  failings  –  most  notably  socialism  and
communism , which rejected private property rights in favor of egalitarian principles, promising a different
contract (the state as guarantor of equality and basic needs in return for citizen’s labor and loyalty). This
section examines how technological and economic upheaval from roughly 1800 to 1945 reconfigured social
contracts in the West, and how states responded either gracefully (through reform) or disastrously (through
repression or ideological campaigns) to the “forcing functions” of industrial modernity. We also contrast
Western liberal adaptations with the revolutionary social contracts proposed by Marxism, setting the stage
for the 20th-century ideological confrontations.
The Social Question: Industrialization, Class Conflict, and Rights
By the mid-19th century, it was clear that the promises of the Enlightenment social contract – liberty,
equality, the protection of property – were colliding with the realities of industrial capitalism. In countries
like Britain, Germany, France, and the United States, the growth of factories and cities produced severe
social dislocations:  crowded slums, child labor, unsafe working conditions, long hours, and meager
wages . The early liberal social contract had largely empowered property-owning elites, but provided
scant  relief  or  voice  to  the  swelling  ranks  of  industrial  workers.  This  gave  rise  to  what  19th-century
commentators called the “Social Question” – how would societies address the glaring injustices and unrest
stemming  from  industrialization?  The  initial  response  in  many  places  was  repression  or  neglect.  For
example, in Britain the Peterloo Massacre  of 1819 saw cavalry charge a peaceful rally for parliamentary
reform, indicating the ruling class’s fear of mass political participation. However , laissez-faire absolutism
proved untenable as unrest grew. The Revolutions of 1848 , which swept across Europe, were a watershed
of this conflict. These uprisings were “essentially democratic and liberal in nature, with the aim of removing
the old monarchical structures”  and also carried early socialist demands. In France, the 1848 revolution
established  universal  male  suffrage  and  even  set  up  National  Workshops  to  alleviate  unemployment,3637

reflecting the influence of thinkers like Louis Blanc who advocated a “right to work” . Although most
of the 1848 revolutions were ultimately crushed, they sent a clear message that laboring classes would no
longer remain voiceless . Indeed, as Britannica notes, even where 1848 failed, it forced concessions: in
Prussia and Austria, monarchs promised constitutions; in Britain, it energized the Chartist movement  for
working-class voting rights . Over the second half of the 19th century, incremental reforms  reshaped
Western social contracts in response to these pressures. Britain’s Parliament passed Reform Acts  in 1832,
1867, and 1884, each expanding the electorate and thus slowly democratizing the political contract (from
5% of adults in 1830 to a majority of men by 1884). Alongside political inclusion came the first  labor
protections :  Britain’s  Factory  Acts  (beginning  1833)  limited  working  hours  for  children  and  women,
responding  to  humanitarian  campaigns  and  unrest.  Trade  unions,  initially  illegal,  were  gradually
decriminalized  (e.g.  UK  Trade  Union  Act  1871),  institutionalizing  workers’  right  to  associate  –  a  tacit
admission that the social contract must encompass collective bargaining power  for labor . The trajectory
was  similar  elsewhere:  France  legalized  unions  in  1884;  Germany’s  industrialization  saw  fierce  class
agitation in the 1860s–70s, which Otto von Bismarck sought to defuse through pioneering social welfare
programs.  Notably,  Germany  in  the  1880s  under  Bismarck  introduced  the  world’s  first  national  social
insurance  schemes (for sickness, accidents, and old-age pensions). Bismarck’s strategy  was explicitly to
adjust  the  social  contract  to  stave  off  socialist  revolution:  “Chancellor  Otto  von  Bismarck’s  decision  to
introduce compulsory health insurance was a reluctant reaction to mounting upheavals among the working
class” .  In  essence,  Germany’s  authoritarian  regime  acknowledged  a  need  to  buy  legitimacy  by
protecting workers from the new insecurities of industrial life. Bismarck proclaimed these policies as an
attempt to reconcile labor to the state – a form of  “mass bribery”  in his own words, offering material
security in return for political quiescence . Such measures laid the groundwork for the  welfare state
concept, which would flourish in the 20th century. The late 19th century also witnessed the crystallization of
ideologies  directly addressing the social contract. On one side,  socialist and communist movements
argued that liberal capitalism’s contract was a sham – it gave legal freedoms but left workers economically
enslaved. Karl Marx (and Engels) posited in The Communist Manifesto  (1848) that the bourgeois social order
was just a veiled dictatorship of the property owners; they advocated a revolutionary new contract: the
abolition of private property and class distinctions, with the proletariat collectively owning the means of
production.  This  communist  “social  contract”  promised  to  fulfill  human  needs  directly  –  “from  each
according to his ability, to each according to his needs” – rather than just formal rights. While Marxism
would only come to power in the 20th century (starting in Russia 1917), the very existence of a revolutionary
alternative pushed many liberal regimes toward reforms to integrate the working class  peacefully. On the
other side,  classical liberals and capitalists  resisted heavy reforms, but even many of them recognized
that unbridled capitalism could undermine social stability. For example, British philosopher John Stuart Mill
advocated  extending  suffrage  to  workers  and  providing  public  education,  believing  an  inclusive  social
contract would both be just and prevent class warfare. By 1900, the  triad of rights  in Western social
contracts  had  visibly  expanded:  property  rights  remained  fundamental  but  were  no  longer  absolute
(progressive  taxation  and  regulation  emerged);  political  rights  had  broadened  toward  universal  male
suffrage (and the movement for women’s suffrage was gaining strength, to be realized in the early 20th
century); and labor rights  – while still limited – were recognized in principle (the idea that the state should
prevent  the  worst  abuses  of  industrial  capitalism  and  provide  a  safety  net).  As  one  scholarly  analysis
observes, the 19th century saw the genesis of “social rights”  as part of citizenship, complementing earlier
civil and political rights . T.H. Marshall famously noted that in Western Europe,  civil rights  (legal
equality, property) were largely won in the 18th century,  political rights  (vote, participation) in the 19th,
and  social rights  (welfare, economic security) in the 20th . This sequential evolution underscores
how industrial and technological change drove an ever-richer understanding of the social contract. In
summary,  the  Industrial  Revolution  forced  Western  societies  to  deepen  the  social  contract:  from  a
minimalist pact protecting property and liberty for the few, into a broader agreement that the state must3940

actively ensure a minimum standard of living and empowerment for the many. Where states met this
challenge  through  reforms  (e.g.  expanding  suffrage,  instituting  social  programs),  they  largely  averted
revolutionary crises and fostered greater national cohesion. Where they did not – or could not fast enough –
more violent ruptures  occurred, as we shall see in the case of late Tsarist Russia and others.
Maladaptive Attractor: The Fate of Tsarist Russia
One of the starkest examples of social contract failure in the industrial age is Tsarist Russia  in the late 19th
and  early  20th  centuries.  The  Russian  Empire  under  the  Romanovs  remained  an  autocracy,  largely
unchanged in political structure since medieval times, even as it began to industrialize and as liberal and
socialist ideas seeped in. The Tsars believed in something akin to divine right (Nicholas II, who ruled from
1894, famously insisted God himself ordained autocracy)  and staunchly refused meaningful power-
sharing or rights for the populace. This proved to be a “maladaptive attractor state”  – a system locked
into outdated forms and unable to adjust to new realities. Despite witnessing other nations evolve, the
Tsarist regime held to an absolutist social contract: the subjects owed complete obedience, and in return
the Tsar would (in theory) act as the “Little Father” caring for them, a paternalist ideal increasingly at odds
with the misery of modern Russian life. By the early 1900s, Russia’s urban workers and peasantry were
seething  with  discontent:  low  wages,  long  hours,  lack  of  land  for  peasants  (even  after  the  1861
emancipation of serfs), and no legal avenues to redress grievances . Meanwhile, an educated liberal
middle class chafed at exclusion from governance and censorship of ideas . The Tsarist social contract –
autocracy in exchange for order and national glory – was failing to deliver on its promises, especially after
the humiliating defeat in the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05) and mounting economic troubles. In 1905, this
pressure cooker exploded in revolution. The causes of the 1905 Revolution lie “in the Tsarist regime’s failure
to accommodate change – a refusal to reform that made peaceful evolution impossible” . Even modest
petitions for a representative assembly or basic civil freedoms were met with intransigence, radicalizing
even  moderates .  On  “Bloody  Sunday”  (Jan  1905),  imperial  troops  fired  on  peaceful  protesters
seeking redress from the Tsar , shattering the myth of the benevolent paternal contract and triggering
nationwide upheaval. Tsar Nicholas II was forced to issue the October Manifesto , granting a constitution
and elected Duma (parliament) – effectively a grudging revision of the social contract to include some
representation.  However ,  this  reform  was  half-hearted  and  soon  undermined  (the  Tsar  dissolved  and
restricted the Dumas repeatedly). The regime slipped back into repression, demonstrating the perils of a
leadership  that  oscillates  between  reform  and  reaction  without  fully  committing  to  a  new  contract.
Ultimately, World War I acted as a final stress test. Russia’s war failures and economic collapse in 1917 broke
whatever remnants of legitimacy the Tsar had. In the  February Revolution of 1917 , the monarchy was
overthrown,  precisely  because  it  “remained  an  absolute  monarchy  with  no  legal  outlet  for  political
opposition…  even  as  society  changed,  the  political  system  refused  to  adapt” .  This  downfall
illustrates a crucial strategic insight: a state that remains a “rigid autocratic regime clinging to 19th-century
absolutism in a changing world”  will eventually shatter under pressure. Tsarist Russia’s fate was a
“maladaptive attractor” because its ruling elite could not conceive of a social contract beyond autocracy,
even  when  industrial  society  demanded  it.  The  resulting  vacuum  was  filled  by  the  Bolsheviks ,  who
proposed an entirely new social contract under communist ideology: abolish private property, vest all power
in soviets (councils of workers and peasants), and ensure everyone’s basic needs in exchange for absolute
loyalty to the Communist Party. The Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917 can be seen as a dramatic forced
reset of the social contract – from a failed autocratic model to an experimental socialist one. We will discuss
later how that new contract functioned (and eventually faltered). For now, the lesson from Tsarist Russia is
stark:  when a regime fails to adjust its foundational bargain to new social realities, it risks violent
collapse . By contrast, countries like Britain, where the ruling class granted reforms (e.g. expanding the47

franchise in 1867 and 1884 to include urban workers), or like Sweden, where labor unrest in the early 1900s
led to peaceful compromises, avoided such revolutionary ruptures. In complex systems terms, flexibility and
adaptation in the social contract are key to avoiding a critical break – a point we will return to in the context
of modern technological disruptions.
Adaptive Responses: Reform and the Welfare State
While Tsarist Russia exemplified inflexibility, many Western societies displayed more adaptive responses  to
the  challenges  of  industrial  modernity,  recalibrating  the  social  contract  through  reforms  that  averted
extremist outcomes. A prime example is the evolution of the British social contract  in the 19th and early
20th centuries. Britain faced the same industrial woes – Dickensian poverty, worker unrest, the Chartist
movement demanding democratic rights. Yet Britain navigated this without revolution, through a series of
timely  concessions:  electoral  reforms  (as  noted),  legalizing  unions,  and  eventually  introducing  a
rudimentary welfare system (old age pensions in 1908, unemployment and health insurance in 1911). Each
of these steps represented the state  taking on new responsibilities  in exchange for social peace. For
instance,  by  the  early  20th  century,  the  Liberal  government  of  H.H.  Asquith  and  David  Lloyd  George
championed social insurance and progressive taxation explicitly to “ensure a basic level of general welfare”
and prevent the working class from drifting to radicalism . In doing so, they redefined the British
social contract – no longer was it enough for the state to uphold property rights and policing; it now had to
guarantee a minimum standard of living (a notion rooted in what Roosevelt would later call “freedom from
want” ). Another instructive case is  Bismarck’s Germany  (mentioned above). Facing the rise of the
Socialist Workers’ Party (SPD) – which Bismarck banned via the Anti-Socialist Laws – he simultaneously tried
a  carrot:  state  socialism.  The  1883  Health  Insurance  Act,  1884  Accident  Insurance,  and  1889  Old  Age
Pension in Germany were revolutionary at the time. Bismarck’s own statement to the Reichstag framed it as
binding the working classes to the state: “Give the working man the right to work as long as he is healthy…
assure him care when he is sick, and maintenance when he is old.”  In effect, the German Empire extended the
social contract to include social rights : if workers remained loyal and eschewed radicalism, the state would
care for them in adversity . Though motivated by elite self-interest, these policies recognized a new
reality – political legitimacy in an industrial society required attending to economic security. The early 20th
century saw these trends accelerate, especially after the  First World War (1914–1918) . The war was a
massive forcing event that compelled even conservative governments to promise social reform. Soldiers
returning from the trenches demanded “homes fit for heroes,” and many countries expanded suffrage to all
men (and in some cases women, e.g. UK 1918 for women over 30, 1928 full equality) as a reward for
wartime  service.  The  interwar  period  (1918–1939)  was  marked  by  a  contest  between  adaptation  and
breakdown. On one hand, some nations implemented significant social contract updates: Sweden, for
example, forged the “Saltsjöbaden Agreement” in 1938 between employers and unions, establishing a
cooperative  model  that  underpinned  a  robust  welfare  state  –  a  classic  graceful  adaptation  to  labor’s
demands through negotiation rather than revolution. On the other hand, the  Great Depression (1929–
1939)  caused  severe  contract  stress  worldwide.  High  unemployment  and  social  misery  led  to  either
progressive reform or the rise of authoritarian regimes as responses. In the United States,  Franklin D.
Roosevelt’s New Deal (1933–1939)  stands out as a major peaceful renegotiation of the American social
contract. Roosevelt argued that the classic American contract – focused on political rights and free markets
–  needed  an  update  to  include  economic  security  as  a  right .  He  spoke  of  a  “Second  Bill  of
Rights” (Economic Bill of Rights) guaranteeing jobs, housing, medical care, etc. While not all these were
realized, the New Deal did establish Social Security (pensions), unemployment insurance, labor rights (the
Wagner Act protecting union organizing), and public works employment for millions. As one analysis notes,
the New Deal “forever altered the founding vision of liberty and social contract by incorporating a new5556
57
42

11
rights-based notion of social justice that ensured a basic level of welfare” . Roosevelt effectively
shifted the U.S. social contract from a narrowly individualist one to a more community-oriented one, with
government actively responsible for citizens’ well-being. Significantly, FDR framed this in social contract
terms: he said Americans had “needed to renegotiate their social contract to require that government
secure economic rights for citizens in addition to political rights” . The implication was that failing to do
so could invite either social revolution or collapse of democracy – fears not unfounded given the rise of
extremist ideologies globally at that time. In Europe, by contrast, the failure to adapt in some cases led to
authoritarian “solutions.”  The poster child here is Weimar Germany , where the government’s inability to
effectively  address  Depression-era  unemployment  and  poverty  eroded  faith  in  the  democratic  social
contract, paving the way for Hitler’s Nazi regime. The Nazis offered a perverse new social contract: the Volk
(people) would be racially unified and provided for (full employment through rearmament, social benefits,
pride of national revival) in exchange for absolute obedience to the Führer and the exclusion/persecution of
those deemed outside the Volk. This contract was based on ultranationalist myth rather than universal
rights, and while it temporarily “solved” unemployment and restored order , it did so by abandoning liberty
and preparing for war – a devil’s bargain that ultimately brought catastrophe. Similarly, in countries like Italy
and Spain, fascist or authoritarian regimes took hold, suggesting that when liberal democracies failed to
adapt rapidly enough , many citizens swung to illiberal alternatives that promised stability or prosperity by
other  means.  In  summary,  the  early  20th  century  experience  reinforced  two  divergent  lessons:  (1)
Adaptation through reform  (as in the New Deal or Scandinavian model) can renew the social contract and
strengthen democracy; (2)  Failure to adapt  opens the door to demagogues who will rewrite the social
contract in more extreme and dangerous ways. Fortunately, the post-World War II era – as we discuss next –
saw many societies consciously learn from these lessons, leading to the golden age of social welfare and
the most inclusive contracts yet seen.
The 20th Century: World Wars, Welfare States, and Competing
Social Contracts
The mid-20th century (1940s–1970s) was a crucible in which modern social contracts were either solidified
or fundamentally redefined across the world. The aftermath of World War II, especially, generated a strong
consensus in many countries around a  “welfare state” social contract in Western democracies , while
also entrenching an alternative socialist/communist contract in the Eastern bloc  under Soviet influence.
The  Cold War  (circa 1947–1991) can itself be interpreted as a competition between two social contract
models: one emphasizing liberal democracy, mixed economies, and gradual expansion of rights; the other
emphasizing state planning, social equality guarantees, but authoritarian political control. This era also saw
the collapse of European colonial empires and the emergence of new nation-states, each forging their own
social contracts often amid ethnic and ideological strife. In this section, we focus on the contrasting Western
and Eastern models, as well as key breakdowns and adaptations. We examine how technological shifts in
communication and surveillance  (e.g. radio, television, early computers) were harnessed by states to
bolster their contracts – whether through propaganda and expanded public services in democracies or
through censorship and secret police in dictatorships. We will also explore pivotal stress events, such as
how  states  responded  to  total  war  and  economic  crises  (e.g.  the  Oil  Shocks  of  the  1970s),  either  by
reaffirming  their  social  contracts  or  by  floundering.  Throughout,  the  triad  of  labor,  property,  and
democratic rights  remained central. In the West, this period saw the apex of labor’s share in the social
contract  (strong  unions,  rising  wages,  welfare  benefits)  alongside  respect  for  property  and  broad
democratic inclusion – an attempt to balance all three. In the Eastern bloc, labor and property were handled
via state ownership and full employment policies (ostensibly guaranteeing labor’s security), but democratic
rights were eliminated, replaced by a one-party “performance legitimacy” akin to an enforced mandate of5556

Heaven. Each model had strengths and vulnerabilities that became evident as the world entered the late
20th century.
The Post-WWII Western Social Contract: Welfare Capitalism and Rights Expansion
World  War  II’s  devastation  and  the  fight  against  fascism  profoundly  influenced  Western  elites  and
populations in thinking about their social contracts. There was a widespread feeling that the sacrifices of
war  and  the  demand  for  postwar  reconstruction  entitled  citizens  to  greater  economic  security  and
opportunity . Additionally, the ideological contest with communism – which promised workers a utopia –
pushed Western democracies to make capitalism more humane to win hearts and minds. The result was the
golden era of the welfare state  in Western Europe and North America (roughly 1945–1975). Governments,
whether led by social democratic or conservative parties, converged on a broad social contract formula: full
(or  near-full)  employment,  rising  standards  of  living,  social  insurance  against  life’s  risks,  and
continued respect for civil-political rights . This was underpinned by unprecedented economic growth in
the postwar decades, which made it fiscally viable to expand benefits widely. A landmark expression of this
new contract was the  1942 Beveridge Report  in the UK, which identified “Five Giants” (Want, Disease,
Ignorance, Squalor , Idleness) to be slain by a comprehensive welfare system. The UK duly established the
National Health Service (free healthcare for all), expanded education, public housing, and unemployment
benefits in the late 1940s – a radical extension of state responsibility for welfare. Other countries followed
suit: France set up extensive social security; West Germany’s “social market economy” combined market
dynamism  with  robust  social  insurance;  Scandinavia  built  even  more  generous  cradle-to-grave  welfare
provisions. In the United States, the New Deal had laid the foundation, and after the war the GI Bill (1944)
further extended opportunities (education, housing loans) to returning veterans, arguably a targeted social
contract reward for service. Later , Medicare and Medicaid (1965) added health entitlements for the elderly
and poor . It’s important to note that labor rights and democratic voice  were also key pillars of the postwar
contract.  Unions  were  powerful  and  recognized  as  partners  in  shaping  economic  policy  (e.g.  through
collective  bargaining  setting  industry  wages).  Politically,  this  era  saw  the  completion  of  democratic
inclusion: in the U.S., the Civil Rights Movement led to the Civil Rights Act (1964) and Voting Rights Act
(1965), finally securing African Americans’ franchise and equality before the law – arguably fulfilling the
political rights portion of the American social contract that had been dishonored in the Jim Crow era .
Many Western European nations similarly extended voting rights to women by the 1950s if they hadn’t
earlier ,  and  proportional  representation  or  multi-party  systems  ensured  diverse  voices  were  heard,
preventing extremist exclusions that had plagued the interwar period. In effect, the Western social contract
after WWII can be summarized as “welfare capitalism with liberal democracy.”  The foundational myth of
these societies became that this model delivered the best of both worlds: prosperity and freedom. Leaders
argued that by ensuring a fair distribution of the gains of growth (through taxes and transfers) and by
actively managing the economy (Keynesian demand management) to avoid depressions, they had created a
stable middle-class society that would not fall prey to extremist ideologies. Indeed, the data bears this out:
inequality fell or remained low in this period, middle-class incomes grew, and there was a sense of shared
national purpose. One can see this as a strategic, graceful adaptation  to the twin forcing functions of the
Depression  and  the  communist  challenge.  As  a  result,  Western  democracies  enjoyed  high  legitimacy;
citizens generally trusted governments to look after their interests, fulfilling their side of the contract by
working and participating civically. Internationally, this era also saw attempts to articulate a  global  social
contract  of  sorts  –  the  United  Nations’  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights  (1948)  declared  a
common standard of rights (civil, political, and social) for all peoples, reflecting the lessons of two world
wars. Though non-binding, it enshrined principles like the right to work, to rest, to a standard of living
adequate for health – essentially trying to universalize the ethos of the welfare state and liberal rights .60
55
13
However , implementation remained at the national level and varied greatly outside the industrialized West.
By the late 1960s, the Western social contract faced new pressures – notably from youth and marginalized
groups who felt it had not gone far enough (the New Left movements, protests of 1968 across many
countries). They criticized bureaucratic conformity and the exclusion of women and minorities from full
equality.  In  response,  there  were  further  adaptations:  anti-discrimination  laws,  expansion  of  higher
education, and, in some places, more participatory politics. Yet the fundamental framework of welfare
capitalism remained intact into the 1970s. It was only in the later 20th century, with economic stagnation
and globalization, that this consensus would be tested – a topic we will examine in the next section on the
late 20th century. Still, at its height, the mid-century Western social contract stands as perhaps the most
successful balancing  of the triad of rights: property rights  were respected but not absolute (governments
actively redistributed and regulated markets to serve the public good),  labor rights  were robust (high
unionization, legal protections, rising real wages tied to productivity), and democratic rights  were broad
(universal suffrage and civil liberties protected). The pay-off was historical levels of social cohesion and
economic equality in many Western countries around 1960–1975 . This period is often nostalgically
remembered as a time when “the system worked” for the average citizen – a benchmark against which
current discontents are measured.
The Communist Social Contract: Promise and Pitfalls
Parallel to the Western developments, a very different social contract was implemented in the Soviet Union
and its satellite states  after World War II. The Soviet social contract , though not openly labeled as such
by the regime, can be described as follows: the state (governed by the Communist Party) guaranteed
employment, basic housing, education, and healthcare for all citizens, and strove to build a classless society;
in exchange, citizens relinquished political freedom and acquiesced to one-party rule and state economic
directives. This was sometimes termed  “authoritarian bargain”  or “performance legitimacy” based on
socioeconomic rights rather than political rights . In initial practice, the Bolshevik Revolution’s ideals
translated into dramatic policies: nationalization of land, banks, and industry; a planned economy aimed at
rapid  industrialization  (the  Five-Year  Plans  under  Stalin);  and  an  official  ideology  of  proletarian
empowerment. The early Soviet period was marked by intense coercion – civil war , purges, famine (e.g. the
Holodomor in Ukraine) – which indicate a violent forging of a new contract against significant resistance. By
the mid-20th century, however , especially after Stalin’s death in 1953, the Soviet regime stabilized into a
more predictable paternalistic pattern often referred to as “Brezhnev’s social contract”  (though it arguably
began earlier). Under this unwritten understanding, the Party elite offered citizens a deal: relative material
security and societal egalitarianism would be maintained, and in return the populace would not challenge
the Party’s political monopoly. There was full employment  (indeed, the constitutional “right to work” was
touted – unemployment was essentially criminalized as “parasitism”),  low-cost basics  (staple foods, rent,
and utilities were heavily subsidized), free education and medical care, and symbolic equality (the rhetoric
that workers and peasants ran the country, even if reality differed). However , consumer goods were often
scarce or low-quality, and personal autonomy was curtailed – the flip side of the contract. Dissent was met
with surveillance (omnipresent KGB informants) and sometimes prison or psychiatric institutionalization.
Crucially, the communist social contract hinged on the regime’s  performance in delivering economic
progress and social welfare . In its early decades, the USSR did achieve rapid industrial growth and became
a  superpower ,  and  in  Eastern  Europe  communist  governments  post-1945  eliminated  illiteracy  and
introduced land reform and welfare in nations that had been quite unequal (appealing to many poor
citizens initially). But over time, as technological innovation moved toward the information age (computers,
advanced  consumer  products),  the  centrally  planned  economies  fell  behind.  By  the  1970s,  the  Soviet
model’s economic stagnation  – shortages, lack of incentives for efficiency – meant it struggled to fulfill its6144
62
14
side of the bargain (e.g. long queues for basic goods became endemic). This erosion of performance would
prove fatal. Still, at its zenith, some observers argued the Soviet system did command a kind of legitimacy
among many citizens: they valued the security and predictability (one knew one’s pension, healthcare, job
were assured) and they had been socialized to accept limited freedoms in return. Surveys in the late Soviet
era showed reasonably high satisfaction with life among older generations, suggesting a social contract
“success”  of a constrained sort . Yet, cracks were visible: intellectuals and youth chafed at censorship
and  lack  of  opportunity,  and  the  very  lack  of  feedback  mechanisms  in  a  one-party  state  meant  the
leadership often didn’t realize how dissatisfied people were becoming until it was too late. In China , after
the tumultuous decades of Mao’s rule (where campaigns like the Great Leap Forward  – a utopian effort to
leap to communism – caused disaster , with about 20 million dying in the 1959–61 famine ), a more
pragmatic social contract emerged from 1978 onward under Deng Xiaoping. Deng essentially rewrote the
Maoist contract: instead of ideological fervor and mass mobilization, it promised economic development
and  rising  living  standards  in  exchange  for  continued  one-party  dominance .  “To  get  rich  is
glorious,” Deng proclaimed, signaling that the Party would permit private initiative and material incentives
(a restoration of property rights in a limited form) but not political liberalization. This Chinese model –
sometimes called  “performance legitimacy”  or the “Beijing consensus” – can be seen as a hybrid: it
borrowed  the  communist  priority  on  socioeconomic  rights  (lifting  hundreds  of  millions  from  poverty
became its legitimation) but used market mechanisms and tolerated inequality to achieve it, all while
maintaining tight authoritarian control. As one analysis succinctly put it, for decades China’s post-1978
social contract was “a straightforward bargain: the state delivers strong economic growth… and the people
accept curbs on their civil liberties and political freedom” . We see that the through-line from Imperial
China’s Mandate of Heaven  to the CCP’s rule is explicit in Chinese discourse  – just as emperors had to
ensure the people’s livelihood to retain Heaven’s favor , the CCP has justified its monopoly by delivering
prosperity and national rejuvenation. Indeed, Chinese scholars like Zhang Weiwei claim this “performance-
based” contract is culturally rooted and has achieved results, citing high public satisfaction in surveys .
However , the communist/socialist approach to social contract had its  pitfalls . It concentrated risk in the
state: if the state failed to deliver (as in USSR’s stagnation or China’s Great Leap Forward), there were no
independent institutions or opposition to course-correct; collapse or crisis could be sudden. Moreover , by
suppressing  dissent,  these  regimes  often  didn’t  get  timely  feedback  –  leading  to  maladaptive  policies
persisting. The Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991 was essentially the breakdown of a social contract: the state
could no longer provide economic security (the late 1980s saw severe shortages) nor ideological conviction,
and once glasnost (openness) gave people a taste of free expression, the lack of genuine consent in the
Soviet contract was exposed. People simply opted out en masse from the communist bargain when given
the chance. In China, after the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 – which were crushed violently – the
Party reaffirmed and doubled down on the economic-growth-for-stability contract, avoiding political reform.
That  worked  spectacularly  in  terms  of  growth,  but  now  (2020s)  China  faces  slowing  growth  and  an
increasingly intrusive surveillance state to manage dissent, as we discuss in the next section. In summary,
the 20th century offered two contrasting yet converging lessons: Western welfare states and communist
states both recognized that modern social contracts must address economic well-being , not just legal
rights  or  traditional  authority.  The  difference  was  in  how –  one  through  democratic  negotiation  and
pluralism, the other through top-down authoritarian rule. Each had successes (Western model in delivering
innovation and freedom with safety nets; Eastern model in rapid mobilization and equalizing development
in poorer societies) and each had failures (Western model sometimes failed minority groups or became
fiscally strained; Eastern model quashed freedom and proved economically inflexible). These experiences
set the stage for the  late 20th century and early 21st , where globalization, the digital revolution, and
renewed East-West competition are forcing yet another rethinking of social contracts worldwide.6263

The Late 20th and Early 21st Century: Globalization, Digital
Technology, and the Erosion of the Postwar Social Contract
From the late 1970s onward, the world underwent accelerating globalization and the advent of the digital
age, developments that have profoundly impacted national social contracts. In the West, the postwar
welfare-state  consensus  began  to  fray  under  economic  stagnation  (stagflation),  the  rise  of  neoliberal
ideology  (Reaganomics/Thatcherism), and later under competitive pressures of globalization (outsourcing,
deindustrialization).  Many  democracies  saw  a  shift  toward  market-oriented  reforms:  deregulation,
privatization, weakening of unions, and curbing welfare expansion. This neoliberal turn  effectively revised
the social contract – prioritizing individual enterprise and shareholder value, while assuming that economic
growth would “trickle down” to benefit all. Property rights and capital mobility were elevated, while labor’s
bargaining power and some social protections were reduced. Initially, this delivered lower inflation and a
boom in some sectors, but over decades it contributed to rising inequality and insecurity for the working
and middle classes in many countries. By the 2000s, a sense emerged that the  postwar social contract
had been hollowed out : younger generations faced stagnating real wages, precarious “gig economy” jobs
lacked traditional benefits, and the expectation that each generation would do better than the last faltered.
Politically, this fueled populist movements  on both right and left, as disenfranchised citizens challenged
elites  for  breaking  the  social  promise.  Meanwhile,  digital  technology  and  the  internet  transformed
communication  and  power  structures.  The  early  internet  (1990s–2000s)  brought  utopian  hopes  of
empowering individuals, enhancing transparency, and bypassing gatekeepers – potentially strengthening
democratic social contracts by enabling bottom-up participation. And indeed, social media later allowed
mass protests and new voices (the Arab Spring 2011, various online activist movements). However , the same
technologies also enabled unprecedented  surveillance and data collection , which both democratic and
authoritarian governments have exploited. The balance between privacy rights and state security powers
became a new frontier of the social contract. For example, after the 9/11 attacks, many Western citizens
tacitly accepted enhanced surveillance (Patriot Act in the US, etc.) in exchange for promised security against
terrorism – a shifting of the contract towards  security over privacy . In authoritarian contexts, digital tools
have provided rulers powerful new affordances to monitor and shape citizen behavior . The clearest case is
China’s embrace of digital surveillance as a governance model  in the 2010s. With ubiquitous CCTV
cameras, facial recognition, big-data analytics, and the nascent Social Credit System , the Chinese state has
sought  to  “replace  a  social  contract  based  on  economic  growth…  with  one  powered  by  digital
surveillance” . Essentially, as China’s explosive growth began to slow, President Xi Jinping pivoted to a
legitimacy based on  control and security : the Party would deliver safety, public order , and perhaps more
equitable development (e.g. his “common prosperity”  initiative aims to reduce extreme inequalities) using
high-tech means, and citizens would acquiesce to near-total loss of privacy . As one report puts it,
Beijing’s new approach is to “predict what people want without giving them a vote or voice… solving social
problems  before  they  occur  and  quashing  dissent”  through  surveillance  and  AI .  This  arguably
creates a new kind of digital-era social contract : omnipresent surveillance and algorithmic governance are
presented as the trade-off for efficiency, safety, and perhaps convenience (e.g. smart-city management for
reducing  traffic,  which  some  citizens  appreciate ).  It’s  a  technocratic  contract  where  consent  is
engineered rather than freely given. The ethical and strategic viability of this is hotly debated – it delivers
short-term stability and some public goods, but at the cost of personal freedoms and with the risk of
system abuses (e.g. the documented use of these tools to repress Uyghur minorities, turning the region of
Xinjiang into an Orwellian police state) . In democratic societies, digital tech has also disrupted the
public sphere – enabling misinformation, foreign interference in elections, and echo chambers that polarize
citizens. This challenges the social contract’s democratic rights component: how can informed consent of
the  governed  be  maintained  when  the  information  environment  is  polluted?  Recent  years  have  seen6667

attempts to renegotiate aspects of this: debates over regulating social media platforms, data privacy laws
(like  Europe’s  GDPR),  and  stronger  fact-checking  and  civic  education  as  correctives.  Another  trend
influencing current social contracts is globalization’s rollback via populism and geopolitical conflict . The
2008 financial crisis severely undermined trust in elites and the contract in Western countries – banks were
bailed out while many citizens lost homes and jobs, leading to resentment that the social contract was only
honored  for  the  powerful  (“too  big  to  fail”).  Movements  like  Occupy  Wall  Street  and  the  rise  of  anti-
establishment politicians signaled a demand for a new contract focusing on fairness. In the 2010s, the
Brexit vote  and the election of Donald Trump represented, in part, a backlash by those who felt left behind
by  globalization’s  social  contract  (which  had  prioritized  cosmopolitan  capital  and  urban  professionals).
These events underline the notion that when significant segments feel the contract no longer serves them,
they will seek to rewrite it, sometimes in disruptive ways. Today, we see a contest of narratives: Should we
double down on open global integration and reform it to be fairer (a new inclusive globalization
contract)? Or retreat to nationalist, protectionist contracts where the state reasserts control for its
citizens at the expense of global cooperation?  COVID-19 (2020–21) added another wrinkle, acting as a
forcing function that tested governments’ obligations (public health vs. personal liberty, stimulus support
for  livelihoods,  etc.).  The  pandemic  saw  a  willingness  in  many  societies  to  accept  emergency  rules
(lockdowns, mask mandates) and massive government spending – effectively pausing neoliberal orthodoxy
– to uphold the social contract of preserving life and economic functioning. Some analysts have called for a
“new  social  contract”  post-pandemic  that  locks  in  lessons  from  this  experience:  e.g.  recognizing
healthcare as a universal right, or the need for better safety nets for gig workers. In China, the harsh “zero-
COVID” policies initially were tolerated as part of the safety-for-obedience contract, but by late 2022 public
frustration led to rare protests, prompting a sudden relaxation – an example of social contract pressure
causing course correction even in an autocracy. Looking at the triad of rights in contemporary contexts :
in  Western  democracies,  property/capital  rights  have  arguably  been  over-weighted  since  the  1980s,
leading to inequality that now threatens social cohesion;  labor rights  eroded (unions weakened, jobs
offshored or automated), fueling populist anger;  democratic rights  are formally intact but functionally
strained by polarization and distrust. Thus, there are calls to “rebalance” the contract: perhaps strengthen
labor rights via higher minimum wages, portable benefits for gig workers, or worker representation on
corporate boards (as some European models have). Also to temper property rights through measures
against  extreme  inequality  (tax  reforms,  anti-trust  actions  on  tech  monopolies)  to  restore  a  sense  of
fairness. Meanwhile, in China and similar regimes , the contract seems to be shifting from pure economic
growth  toward  a  blend  of  nationalism,  security,  and  moderate  prosperity  –  Xi  Jinping’s  government
emphasizes  themes  like  fighting  corruption  (to  maintain  public  trust),  environmental  protection  (as
pollution became a major public gripe, the state responded, recognizing that the contract now includes
quality of life, not just GDP ), and high-tech prowess. However , the ever-tighter surveillance and
control might be diminishing the tacit consent of especially younger , educated Chinese, who increasingly
chafe  at  censorship  and  lack  of  personal  freedoms.  Some  observers  suggest  the  Chinese  contract  is
“fraying” as economic growth slows and expectations rise . If people feel they gave up freedom for
prosperity and now prosperity is uncertain, discontent can grow – a dynamic to watch. It’s notable that Xi’s
answer has been not political reform but  even more  control (e.g. using digital surveillance to preempt
dissent ). This could lead to a high-tech  “maladaptive attractor”  if not careful – the system might
become so rigid that an eventual breakdown (if it comes) would be sudden and chaotic. Finally, a looming
factor for all societies is the rapid advancement of automation and artificial intelligence  in the digital
age. These technologies promise great wealth creation but also threaten to displace millions of workers.
This raises the question: does the social contract need to guarantee something like universal basic income
(UBI)  or some form of “right to meaningful work” or livelihood in an era where human labor may be less
needed?  Some  thinkers  argue  we  need  a  “new  social  contract  for  the  age  of  AI”  where  education,
continuous retraining, and income support are built in, so that technological progress doesn’t unravel social7475

stability . Likewise, AI and digital life raise issues of data rights  – should individuals have property rights
over their personal data, or is it part of the social commons? How societies answer these will shape the
coming contract. In summary, as we stand in the early 2020s,  social contracts around the world are
under renovation . Western democracies are trying to recalibrate after a period of neoliberal excess that
undermined solidarity; some are experimenting with neo-Keynesian ideas, green new deals (linking social
contract with sustainability), and efforts to bring the digital economy to heel (antitrust vs. Big Tech, privacy
laws).  Authoritarian  regimes  are  refining  their  contracts  with  advanced  tech  –  offering  security,
convenience, and national pride but at the cost of freedom, betting that economic turbulence can be
weathered with enough control. And globally, humanity faces shared forcing functions – climate change,
pandemics,  geopolitical  shifts  –  that  might  necessitate  a  new  global  social  contract  (for  instance,
agreements to fairly share burdens of carbon reduction, or vaccine distribution). The critical point is that
technology has again changed the affordances of state and society : digital connectivity empowers
individuals and small groups (hackers, activists) in ways that challenge traditional authority, but it also
empowers states to microscopically manage citizens. The social contracts of the 21st century will be defined
by how we strike the balance between these forces – liberty and control, innovation and equality, global
integration and local community. The next section will synthesize these historical insights into strategic
recommendations  for  policymakers  seeking  to  build  resilient  social  contracts  in  this  rapidly  changing
environment.
Strategic Insights and Policy Recommendations
Tracing the evolution of social contracts across eras and cultures yields several  strategic insights  for
leaders and citizens today. History shows that social contracts are neither static nor self-maintaining – they
require continual renewal and adjustment as conditions change. When those in power proactively adapt the
contract  to  new  realities  (technological,  economic,  or  social),  societies  tend  to  experience  smoother
progress and fewer ruptures . Conversely, when elites cling to outdated arrangements or neglect broad-
based needs, the social fabric frays, often ending in crisis or radical change. Below, we distill key lessons
and offer policy recommendations  aimed at forging stable and just social contracts in the 21st century:
Proactive Adaptation to Technological Change:  Governments should  anticipate  and address the
social impacts of major technological shifts – whether automation, AI, or biotech – before  discontent
explodes. Technological revolutions redistribute power and wealth, creating new winners and losers.
A strategic state will smooth this transition by updating the social contract: for example, consider
establishing  universal  basic  income  or  federal  job  guarantees  if  AI  dramatically  reduces
employment in certain sectors, and invest heavily in re-skilling programs for displaced workers. Just
as industrializing states eventually adopted labor laws and social insurance to civilize industrial
capitalism , today’s policymakers must craft safety nets for the digital economy (portable
benefits  for  gig  workers,  lifelong  learning  accounts,  etc.).  The  goal  is  to  ensure  technology
augments  human welfare rather than undermines it. Countries that fail to do so risk “maladaptive”
outcomes – e.g. mass unemployment or extreme inequality fueling unrest – whereas those that
succeed can harness innovation while preserving social stability. Recommendation:  Convene foresight
commissions (including technologists, economists, citizen groups) to continually assess emerging
tech  and  recommend  preemptive  contract  adjustments  (such  as  new  regulations,  education
curricula, or social programs).
Balance Between Property Rights and Social Rights:  A healthy social contract requires  balance
among labor rights, property rights, and democratic rights – neglecting any one can destabilize the77

whole . Western history shows that overly privileging property (capital) at the expense of
labor leads to severe inequality and erodes the legitimacy of liberal regimes . On the other
hand,  disregarding  property  rights  entirely  (as  in  extreme  statism)  can  stifle  innovation  and
prosperity,  eventually  also  causing  contract  failure  (e.g.  the  Soviet  collapse).  Recommendation:
Policymakers should strive for a “social market”  approach – protect private property and enterprise,
but within a framework that guarantees workers a fair share (living wages, collective bargaining
rights) and provides robust public services (healthcare, education, housing) as social rights. Empirical
evidence suggests that when citizens feel the economy is fair and their basic needs are secure, they
are more supportive of open democracy and less susceptible to extremist appeals . Tools to
achieve  this  balance  include  progressive  taxation,  antitrust  enforcement  to  prevent  wealth
concentration,  and  perhaps  worker  co-determination  in  firms  (giving  employees  a  voice  in
decisions). By ensuring the economic realm operates for the many and not just the few, democratic
governments can renew trust  in the social contract.
Democratic  Renewal  and  Participation  in  the  Digital  Age:  With  rising  polarization  and
misinformation,  democratic  rights  need  reinforcement.  A  key  insight  is  that  transparency  and
inclusion are antidotes to alienation . In the digital era, states should use technology not only for
surveillance  or  efficiency,  but  to  engage  citizens  –  for  instance,  platforms  for  participatory
budgeting or crowdsourcing ideas for legislation can give people a tangible sense of contribution.
Taiwan’s  use  of  digital  democracy  tools  to  crowdsolve  issues  is  one  model.  Recommendation:
Implement e-governance initiatives that invite public input (while safeguarding against bots and
manipulation).  Additionally,  bolster  civic  education  focusing  on  media  literacy  so  citizens  can
navigate  the  information  flood  responsibly  –  this  helps  maintain  an  informed  electorate,  the
cornerstone of the democratic social contract . Finally, consider institutional innovations like
citizens’ assemblies for critical long-term issues (climate, AI ethics); such bodies can break partisan
gridlock and update the social contract through consensus-driven recommendations. When people
see that their voices truly matter in shaping policy, the legitimizing myth of “government by the
people”  is sustained in practice.
Accountability and Anti-Corruption as Legitimizing Pillars:  Across cultures, a recurring element
of social contract breakdown is  perceived corruption or unaccountability of elites . From the
French monarchy’s extravagance to Communist Party officials’ privileges in late USSR, when rulers
appear to breach the trust (serving themselves, not the people), the foundational myth crumbles.
Thus,  enforcing  high  standards  of  integrity  in  public  service  isn’t  just  moral  –  it’s  strategic.
Recommendation:  Strengthen anti-corruption agencies, protect free press and whistleblowers, and
leverage technology for open contracting and transparency in governance (e.g. publish budgets and
procurements online in machine-readable formats for civic tech scrutiny). As seen in China’s recent
anti-corruption drive (which was crucial for Xi to shore up the CCP’s image) , cleaning house
can renew a regime’s mandate. However , unlike China’s top-down approach, democracies should
institutionalize  impartial  checks  (independent  judiciaries,  ombudsmen)  so  that  accountability  is
systematic, not selective. Leaders must remember that the social contract is a two-way street  – if
people uphold laws and pay taxes, they expect honesty and competence in return.
Security with Rights: Resisting the Temptation of the Surveillance State:  Modern states face
legitimate security challenges (terrorism, cyber threats, pandemics), and citizens do value safety.
However , as the  Chinese model  demonstrates, it is possible to go too far , creating a surveillance-
heavy contract that, while providing short-term order , may incur long-term costs in innovation and7980

trust. Constant surveillance can chill the very feedback and creativity that keep a society resilient.
Insight:  Security measures work best when they have public buy-in and oversight – they must be part
of the social contract, not outside it.  Recommendation:  Democracies should establish clear legal
frameworks for surveillance tech usage, including sunset clauses, judicial warrants, and independent
audits  (possibly  citizen  review  boards  for  algorithms).  This  ensures  that  efforts  to  “predict  and
preempt” threats do not silently erode civil liberties . Internationally, promote norms around
digital rights – for instance, advocate a “Digital Geneva Convention” to limit state use of cyber tools
against civilians. States that uphold liberty while protecting security will offer a  compelling social
contract  alternative  to  the  purely  authoritarian  approach,  one  likely  more  sustainable  as  it
harnesses voluntary public cooperation rather than enforced compliance.
Fostering  a  New  Global  Social  Contract:  Many  challenges  today  are  global  –  climate  change,
migration, pandemics – and no nation can address them alone. Yet, the social contract concept has
been primarily national. Strategic foresight suggests we need elements of a global social contract  –
agreements  that  all  peoples  deserve  certain  protections  and  that  all  states  have  duties  to  the
common good. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights  was an early foundation, but now
issues  like  climate  justice  call  for  updating  the  global  bargain.  Recommendation:  Work  through
international forums to solidify commitments such as: a fair share of emissions reductions by each
country (with support to developing nations – essentially a contract between rich and poor countries
for an equitable climate transition), global health agreements for sharing vaccines and medical
knowledge, and perhaps frameworks for managing AI so it benefits humanity broadly (preventing an
arms race or corporate capture). Just as individuals form societies for mutual benefit, nations should
recommit to global compacts – this can be sold domestically as enlightened self-interest: a stable
international order and sustainable planet form the external “social contract” for nations’ survival .
Policymakers should frame global cooperation not as charity but as extending our social contract
principles (security, welfare, justice) beyond borders in an age of interdependence.
Cultural Legitimacy and Narrative:  Finally, any social contract – however well-designed in policy –
must live in the hearts of the people through a  compelling narrative or myth . Leaders should
articulate a vision of national identity and purpose that resonates and includes all groups. This might
draw on historic myths (as Chinese leaders invoke the Mandate of Heaven concept albeit in secular
form ) or new stories (like the American “New Deal” reimagining freedom as including freedom
from want ).  Recommendation:  Invest in civic rituals, public history, and national projects that
reinforce the shared values underpinning the social contract. For example, a universal national
service program (military or civilian) can both provide useful infrastructure and forge common civic
identity across class and region – a tangible social contract experience of mutual obligation. By
continually renewing the “mythos”  – the story of who “we the people” are and what we owe each
other – societies make their social contracts emotionally robust, not just intellectually accepted. In
divisive times, emphasizing common ground (perhaps a new narrative of solidarity in facing climate
change or a pandemic) can quell zero-sum populist anger and redirect it towards collective problem-
solving.
In conclusion, the deep study of social contracts past and present teaches that legitimacy is not a given –
it is earned and re-earned  by meeting the needs of the people and adapting to change. States that
navigate transitions gracefully do so by extending new rights or benefits in step with new demands (e.g.
Bismarck’s  insurance,  FDR’s  New  Deal)  and  by  folding  new  constituencies  into  the  political  process
(expanding who “counts” in the contract). Those that fail end up facing forceful corrections from below (be it6970

revolution, collapse, or at minimum a loss of public trust and efficacy). In our era of whirlwind technological
advances and global interconnection, the social contract will likely undergo one of its most significant
renegotiations since the Enlightenment. By heeding these historical lessons and acting with foresight and
inclusivity, leaders and citizens can forge social contracts for the 21st century  that are resilient, equitable,
and empowering – contracts that preserve human dignity and freedom even as we embrace the tools of the
modern age, and that bind us together in pursuit of the common good  in a rapidly changing world.
