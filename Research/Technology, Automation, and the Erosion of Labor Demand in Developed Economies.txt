Technology, Automation, and the Erosion of Labor
Demand in Developed Economies
Introduction
Technological progress has long been viewed as a driver of productivity, new industries, and improved living
standards. The mainstream economic orthodoxy holds that while technology may disrupt certain jobs, it
ultimately creates new employment opportunities and raises overall prosperity. From the mechanization of
agriculture  to  the  computer  revolution,  history  is  often  cited  to  show  that  fears  of  “technological
unemployment” are unfounded, as new jobs emerge to absorb displaced workers. Recent advances in
automation and artificial intelligence (AI) have again stirred debate about the future of work, but many
economists  and  policymakers  maintain  an  optimistic  view:  technology,  they  argue,  will  continue  to
create more jobs than it destroys, boosting productivity and wages in the long run . 
This report directly challenges that conventional view by examining the hypothesis that automation and
related technologies have been eroding labor demand and suppressing wage growth  in developed
economies. Focusing on the United States, Western Europe, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia from
roughly 1950 to the present, the analysis will show that successive waves of automation – from mechanical
automation and early computers to modern AI – have coincided with  declining labor force participation,
stagnating  real  wages,  a  falling  labor  share  of  national  income,  and  job  polarization .  The  emergence  of
“superstar” firms that achieve huge revenues with relatively few workers, the decoupling of corporate
success from broad employment, and qualitative degradation of many new jobs all point to a weakening of
labor’s position. 
Scope  and  Approach:  We  survey  historical  macroeconomic  trends  in  labor  demand  over  the  postwar
period, drawing on primary data and research from institutions such as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS), the OECD, and the International Labour Organization (ILO). We present empirical evidence on labor
force participation rates, employment-to-population ratios, real wage growth (or lack thereof), and labor’s
share of income. We examine occupational shifts – notably the decline of manufacturing and routine office
jobs  –  and  the  rise  of  low-wage  service  employment,  linking  these  to  waves  of  mechanization,
computerization, and digitization. Case studies of specific automation technologies (from industrial robots
and ATMs to robotic process automation and generative AI) illustrate the  displacement effects  on both
blue-collar and white-collar work. We also analyze the displacement vs. creation  dynamics: to what extent
has technology eliminated jobs or tasks faster than it creates new ones? This includes discussion of job
polarization (the hollowing-out of middle-skill jobs) and the troubling evidence that recent decades have
seen accelerated displacement with weaker creation of new jobs . 
Crucially,  the  report  addresses  counterarguments  and  aggregate  indicators  often  cited  as  proof  that
technology is not harming workers – for example, low unemployment rates or the proliferation of new job
titles in the tech sector . We argue that headline job numbers can be misleading , masking deteriorating
job quality, stagnant median earnings, and a shift of economic rewards from labor to capital. The rise of
part-time, temporary, and gig work (the “alternative workforce”) has allowed total employment figures to1

recover  even  as  traditional  stable  jobs  vanish .  Meanwhile,  a  “labor  glut”  –  whether  from
demographic  trends,  globalization,  or  automation  itself  acting  as  a  synthetic  workforce  –  has  undercut
workers’ bargaining power . This glut, combined with declining unionization, has tilted the balance of power
toward capital owners, contributing to historically high corporate profit shares  and historically low labor
income shares . 
Organization:  The report is structured as follows. We begin with a historical overview of labor demand and
supply  since  1950,  highlighting  major  trends  in  labor  force  participation,  employment  growth  versus
population  growth,  real  wage  growth,  and  labor  share  of  income.  Next,  we  examine  how  successive
technological waves  (mechanization, computerization, and AI) have impacted different occupational groups –
from factory workers to clerical staff to professionals – and how these shifts manifest in phenomena like job
polarization. We then explore the concept of “superstar firms” and how the concentration of economic
activity  in  a  few  highly  automated,  high-productivity  firms  has  decoupled  business  success  from  job
creation . The subsequent sections delve into  case studies of automation technologies  (including
back-office  automation  and  AI-driven  tools)  and  their  documented  labor  effects.  We  then  tackle  the
displacement  versus  creation  debate  using  insights  from  recent  economic  research,  and  confront  the
counterarguments commonly offered by techno-optimists. Finally, we discuss the broader implications for
labor’s bargaining power and conclude by synthesizing the evidence that technology’s impact on labor in
developed economies has been far more corrosive than the rosy conventional wisdom suggests – a trend
that, if unaddressed, could continue to suppress wages and worker power in the years ahead.

Historical Trends in Labor Demand and Wages Since 1950
Postwar Boom and Rising Participation (1950s–1970s)
In the early post–World War II decades, developed economies experienced robust growth that drove strong
demand  for  labor .  In  the  United  States,  unemployment  remained  low  and  labor  force  participation
climbed significantly from 1950 through the late 1990s. Overall labor force participation (the share of the
adult population either employed or actively seeking work) rose from about 60% in 1950 to a peak of 67.3%
around the year 2000 . A major factor was the  surge of women entering the workforce : female
participation rose from around 32% in 1948 to roughly 60% by 2000 . The postwar decades also saw the
large Baby Boom cohort come of working age, expanding the labor supply and filling a rapidly growing
number of jobs. Between 1970 and 1990 alone – a period of accelerating socio-economic change – the U.S.
labor force participation rate jumped from 60.4% to 66.4%, with women’s entry accounting for the bulk of
this increase . Similar trends played out in many Western European countries, where rising female
employment and expansion of white-collar sectors drove participation upwards (albeit often starting from
lower levels than the U.S.). Japan likewise saw high labor demand during its postwar economic miracle,
maintaining low unemployment even as its population grew. In essence, the mid-20th century was a time
when  technological  advancements  (e.g.  industrial  automation  on  factory  floors)  coincided  with  broad-
based economic growth that generated new jobs in manufacturing, construction, and burgeoning
service industries . Real wages rose in tandem with productivity, and labor’s share of national income
remained comparatively stable during this period. 45

However , even in these boom years, technology began to reshape the job landscape. Mechanization and
productivity  improvements  in  agriculture  dramatically  reduced  farm  employment  as  a  share  of  the
workforce (freeing up labor for industry and services). In manufacturing, automation  through mechanized
assembly lines and early computers increased output per worker , but the expanding postwar consumer
economy absorbed displaced factory workers into new roles. The orthodox economic narrative solidified:
productivity growth would increase  labor demand by fueling higher incomes, which in turn created demand
for  more  goods,  services,  and  jobs  –  a  virtuous  circle.  Policymakers  largely  saw  technology  as
complementary  to  labor ,  not  a  substitute,  during  this  era.  This  view  seemed  to  be  validated  by  the
conditions of the time: strong unions bargained for a share of productivity gains, real median wages rose ,
and the income of a broad middle class grew steadily through the 1950s and 1960s . 
Turning Point: Stagnation and Divergence (1980s–2000s)
Around the 1970s and 1980s, the landscape began to change. A confluence of factors – oil shocks and
stagflation, globalization, the spread of computers, and policy shifts – led to  slower growth in labor
demand  relative to supply. In the United States, labor force participation continued to edge up through the
1980s and 1990s (largely due to women and Baby Boomers), but by 2000 it hit a plateau and then began
to decline . The overall U.S. participation rate fell from its 67.3% peak in 2000 down to the low 60s in
recent  years .  Notably,  prime-age  male  participation  had  been  sliding  for  decades  –  U.S.  men’s
participation dropped from 86.7% in 1948 to about 73% by 2005 , and stands at roughly 67–68% today
 – reflecting the long-run exit of men from the labor force as manufacturing jobs dried up and some
failed  to  transition  to  other  work.  In  Western  Europe  and  Japan,  labor  force  trends  differed  due  to
demographic and cultural factors (for instance, European female participation increased later and more
gradually, and Japan’s population began aging earlier). But many advanced economies shared a common
outcome  by  the  late  1990s  and  2000s:  employment  growth  no  longer  kept  pace  with  population
growth , leading to either rising inactivity or higher unemployment, especially for less-skilled workers. In
other words, the demand for labor was no longer automatically absorbing all available supply as it had in
the postwar boom. 
One stark indicator is the employment-to-population ratio  for prime working-age adults. In the U.S., the
employment rate for workers aged 25–54 climbed to around 81% in 2000, then fell markedly after 2000 and
again after the 2008 financial crisis, only returning to roughly 80% by the late 2010s. Other developed
nations similarly saw  jobless recoveries  after recessions in the early 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s – periods
where  output  (GDP)  recovered  but  employment  lagged,  suggesting  that  firms  were  meeting  renewed
demand  through  productivity/automation  gains  or  offshoring  rather  than  rehiring  workers.  This
phenomenon  contributed  to  what  many  economists  described  as  structural  unemployment  or
underemployment: even when jobs were available, they were often not in the same sectors or locations as
the workers who had lost jobs, nor of the same quality. 
Most crucially,  real wage growth for the typical worker slowed dramatically after the 1970s . In the
United States, the postwar linkage between productivity gains and wage gains broke down. From 1979 to
2019, net productivity (output per hour) in the U.S. nonfarm business sector rose by roughly 70%, yet the
inflation-adjusted hourly compensation of a typical worker rose by only about 12–15% in the same
40-year period . Earlier data show that between  1973 and 2013, productivity grew ~74% while the
average  worker’s  hourly  pay  rose  just  9% ,  barely  budging  in  real  terms .  This  well-documented
productivity–pay gap  illustrates that overall economic growth did not translate into broadly shared
wage  growth  as  it  once  did.  A  number  of  explanations  have  been  offered  –  from  globalization  and1314

weakened unions to policy choices – but a significant part of the story is technological change  altering the
demand for different types of labor . We will explore this in depth, but the broad pattern is clear:  real
median wages have essentially stagnated in many advanced economies since around 1980 , even as
GDP and productivity continued to rise. Western Europe saw a similar divergence in some countries (though
generally less extreme than in the U.S.), with wage growth for middle and lower earners slowing and
inequality rising. Japan experienced literal wage decline – average real wages in Japan in the 2010s were
lower than in the 1990s – amidst decades of sluggish growth and extensive automation in manufacturing. 
Another fundamental trend is the  decline in labor’s share of national income . The labor share (the
portion of GDP paid out as wages, salaries, and labor compensation as opposed to capital income) was
once thought to be relatively constant, but since the 1980s it has fallen in many countries . Globally, the
labor share has “significantly declined since the early 1980s,”  as documented by Karabarbounis and
Neiman (2014), who find the decline occurring in “the large majority of countries and industries” . In the
United  States,  labor’s  share  of  GDP  dropped  several  percentage  points  in  recent  decades,  reaching
historically low levels by the 2010s . For example, one study notes that the U.S. labor share fell sharply
after 2000, and  by the mid-2010s it was several points lower than in the 1970s , reflecting trillions of
dollars that shifted from wages to profits. Many European countries have seen similar declines in labor
share since the 1980s . In Australia, the trend has been especially pronounced in recent years – by
2022 the share of GDP going to employees in Australia hit a record low (around 44%), while the share
going to corporate profits hit a record high (~30%) . This inverse movement of labor and capital
shares is a strong indication that workers are capturing a smaller portion of the economic pie  than they
used to, with capital owners taking more . Crucially, research has tied roughly half of the global labor
share decline to technology: cheaper capital (e.g. information technology and automation equipment) has
induced  firms  to  substitute  machines  for  workers ,  thus  shifting  income  away  from  labor .  One
landmark study found that the  falling price of investment goods  (computers, software, robots, etc., made
cheaper by tech progress) explains about 50% of the labor share decline, as businesses found it economical
to  “shift  away  from  labor  and  toward  capital.”  This  dynamic  directly  links  the  adoption  of  new
technology to the erosion of labor’s overall claim on output.
In summary, by the early 21st century, developed economies had entered a regime where labor demand
was  no  longer  keeping  up  with  labor  supply ,  and  where  the  gains  from  economic  growth  were
increasingly accruing to capital and a small segment of high-skilled labor rather than the broad workforce.
The historical data on participation, wages, and income distribution all reflect this shift. The next sections
will drill down into how  technology and automation  have been at the center of these transformations –
altering the structure of employment and enabling outcomes that diverge from the earlier mid-century
pattern in which rising tides lifted all boats.
Technological Waves and Occupational Shifts: From Factory Floor to
Office and Beyond
Technology’s impact on labor is perhaps most vividly seen in occupational shifts  – certain job categories
shrink or disappear while others grow. Since 1950, developed economies have undergone several major
waves of technological change, each affecting different segments of the workforce:
Mechanical  Automation  and  Factory  Productivity  (1950s–1970s):  Widespread  adoption  of
automatic machinery, industrial robots (beginning in the 1960s), and improved industrial processes7

boosted manufacturing output but gradually reduced the number of workers needed on the factory
floor . Industrial employment initially grew in absolute terms (peaking in many countries around the
1970s) but began to decline as productivity gains outpaced demand growth.
Computerization  and  the  Digital  Revolution  (1980s–2000s):  The  introduction  of  computers,
software, and the internet automated many routine tasks, not only in manufacturing but in offices
and service industries. This era saw  middle-skill “routine” jobs  – typified by assembly line work,
clerical  and  administrative  roles,  and  repetitive  service  tasks  –  come  under  pressure.  Many
manufacturing production jobs were offshored or replaced by robots, while clerical tasks (filing,
typing, bookkeeping) were increasingly handled by computer programs.
Advanced Automation and AI (2010s–present):  Recent advances in machine learning, robotics,
and AI now threaten tasks that were previously considered safe, including many white-collar and
professional  duties.  Technologies  like  robotic  process  automation  (RPA)  can  handle  back-office
processes, and generative AI  can produce human-like text, potentially affecting fields from customer
service  to  journalism  and  software  coding.  This  wave  is  still  unfolding,  but  early  signs  show
companies using AI to streamline roles in ways that could significantly reduce demand for certain
skilled workers.
Let us examine some key occupational impacts in detail.
The Decline of Manufacturing Employment
Nothing illustrates the impact of automation on labor demand better than the fate of manufacturing
employment in advanced economies. In the mid-20th century, manufacturing was a dominant source of
jobs for workers without college degrees. In 1950, roughly 30% of all jobs in the United States were in
manufacturing . This was mirrored in other industrialized nations: manufacturing comprised a large
share of employment in postwar Western Europe and Japan as well. However , over the decades, technology
radically increased manufacturing productivity, meaning far fewer workers were needed to produce the
same output. 
By the early 21st century, manufacturing employment had plummeted. In the U.S., manufacturing fell to
only about 8% of total employment by 2023  – an all-time low in modern records .  Figure 1  below
illustrates this dramatic long-term decline in the U.S.: from about one-third of the workforce in the 1950s–
60s down to roughly one-twelfth today . Other advanced economies saw similar trends. For example, the
United Kingdom went from around 25% of workers in manufacturing in the 1970s to under 8% by the
2010s. Even Germany – often noted for its strong industrial base – has seen manufacturing’s employment
share fall significantly from postwar highs. Japan’s manufacturing employment peaked in the 1990s and has
since declined both in share and absolute terms (exacerbated by an aging population). 
Figure 1: Manufacturing’s share of total employment in the United States, 1939–2023. The sector’s employment
share fell from about 30% in the 1950s–60s to just 8.3% by mid-2023, reflecting the impact of automation,
productivity gains, and offshoring on industrial jobs . Similar declines in manufacturing employment share
have occurred across advanced economies.
The reasons for manufacturing job loss are multifaceted – globalization (offshoring production to lower-
wage countries) played a role, as did economic shifts to services – but  automation was a key driver .•

Industrial robots and computer-controlled machinery took over tasks on assembly lines that used to require
many  pairs  of  hands.  For  instance,  automobile  factories  that  once  employed  tens  of  thousands  now
produce even more cars with only a few thousand workers overseeing robotic systems. One telling statistic:
U.S. manufacturing output (real value-added) in 2019 was higher than in 1990, yet the sector employed
about 7 million fewer workers  than it did in 1990 . This suggests that productivity gains, largely enabled
by automation and better technology, allowed more output with far less labor.  Academic studies confirm this,
finding  that  the  introduction  of  industrial  robots  has  had  sizable  negative  effects  on  manufacturing
employment and wages in local labor markets exposed to these robots . In the aggregate, the shift is
clear – manufacturing is no longer the mass employer it once was, even though societies still consume
manufactured goods in large quantities.
For the workers affected, this transition was painful. Many displaced manufacturing workers  (often mid-
skill roles with decent pay) struggled to find equally well-paying work elsewhere. Some transitioned into
lower-paying  service  jobs,  others  left  the  workforce  entirely  or  faced  long-term  unemployment.  As
manufacturing receded, the jobs that grew were disproportionately in services – but not all services are
equal,  as  we’ll  explore.  Notably,  manufacturing’s  decline  disproportionately  hurt  workers  without
college degrees , contributing to a widening wage gap based on education. It also weakened labor unions
(which had been strongest in manufacturing sectors), thus reducing collective bargaining power in the
economy as a whole. We will later see how these changes tie into labor’s declining share of income and
bargaining power .
Automation of Routine Office and Administrative Work
If factories were the first front in the automation story, offices were the second. Starting in the 1980s, the
spread of personal computers, database software, and eventually the internet enabled the automation of
many routine clerical and administrative tasks . Jobs that involved processing information, maintaining
records,  or  performing  repetitive  calculations  were  ripe  for  computerization.  Over  time,  roles  such  as
typists, switchboard operators, filing clerks, bank tellers, travel agents, and many secretaries saw sharp
declines. For example, the number of secretaries and administrative assistants  in the U.S. workforce fell
significantly as executives and professionals began doing their own typing/email and as office management
software handled scheduling and record-keeping. Many back-office functions in banking, insurance, and
government were streamlined through software, reducing the need for clerks.
Empirical data bear this out. A recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland highlights that from
1980 through 2015, the share of clerical jobs (office and administrative support roles) in the U.S.
workforce declined substantially . Importantly, this decline was  uneven across regions : it was much
steeper in large, high-tech cities  (which adopted information and communication technologies faster)
than in smaller cities . In high-cost metropolitan areas like New York or San Francisco, the share of
workers in clerical occupations dropped by about 6.5 percentage points between 1980 and 2015, whereas in
smaller , less tech-driven locales the drop was around 2.3 percentage points . Essentially, as businesses
embraced personal computers, spreadsheets, and later the internet, they eliminated many support
roles  – especially in the most technologically progressive firms and cities. The remaining administrative
workers in big cities increasingly needed higher skills (often a college degree) and took on more complex
tasks complementary to professionals, as simpler duties were taken over by software .
More recent data shows that this trend continued into the 2010s and accelerated with new automation
tools.  Across  all  office  and  administrative  support  occupations,  the  U.S.  lost  over  2  million  jobs24

between 2016 and 2021 . Financial clerks (e.g. bookkeeping, payroll, accounts clerks) and secretaries/
administrative assistants were hit especially hard, shrinking 10.3% and 8.7% respectively in just a five-year
span . This coincides with the deployment of  robotic process automation (RPA)  in many companies –
software “bots” that can perform data entry, invoice processing, and other routine digital tasks – as well as
the  continued  improvements  in  standard  enterprise  software  that  reduce  clerical  workloads.  The
Conference  Board  attributes  these  rapid  recent  declines  to  automation  replacing  specific  tasks :  for
instance, secretaries’ traditional duties in scheduling meetings, making travel arrangements, and managing
paper files have largely been supplanted by integrated calendar apps, online booking systems, and digital
document  management .  Similarly,  financial  clerks  who  once  manually  recorded  transactions  or
processed  forms  have  seen  those  tasks  “optimized  through  automated  integrated  bookkeeping
systems” . In short, many traditional  white-collar support jobs have been disappearing , their functions
absorbed by technology.
This shift has contributed to the phenomenon of job polarization : the labor market’s middle rungs (both
blue-collar manufacturing and white-collar clerical roles that offered middle-class wages) have hollowed
out, while growth has concentrated at the high-skill/high-pay top and the low-skill/low-pay bottom .
Professionals  like  managers,  engineers,  and  computer  scientists  (whose  jobs  are  complemented  by
technology)  have  generally  thrived,  as  have  low-end  service  workers  (whose  jobs  are  insulated  from
automation but often pay poorly, such as food servers, home health aides, janitors). The ones in between –
factory workers, administrative assistants, sales clerks, etc. performing routine tasks – have borne the brunt
of automation-driven displacement. 
It’s worth noting that technology doesn’t always directly eliminate jobs one-for-one; sometimes it changes
the composition of tasks within jobs . For example, an administrative assistant today might handle more
complex responsibilities (like project coordination) than a 1980s secretary did, because the simpler tasks
(typing letters, maintaining physical files) are done by computers. In many cases, though, organizations
simply  require  fewer  people  in  support  roles  than  before.  A  telling  comparison  can  be  made:  Large
corporations in the past had floors of clerks and typing pools; today, a much leaner administrative staff
supports  a  given  number  of  executives,  thanks  to  digital  tools.  This  “labor-saving”  aspect  of  office
technology has clearly weakened demand for those workers who historically filled these occupations.
The Rise of Service and Knowledge Work – but Not Always Good Jobs
As manufacturing and routine office jobs declined, the sectors that expanded were mainly services  – but
with a dichotomy. On one hand,  knowledge-intensive services  grew: industries like finance, consulting,
software, education, and healthcare added many jobs, including highly skilled roles (financial analysts,
software developers, medical professionals) that are often well-paid. On the other hand,  lower-skilled
services  also grew rapidly: retail, hospitality, food service, cleaning, caregiving, and other person-to-person
services proliferated, often offering precarious employment and low wages. This bifurcation again reflects
technology’s influence. High-skill service jobs typically involve non-routine cognitive tasks that computers
historically couldn’t automate (though AI is now encroaching on some). Low-skill service jobs often involve
manual or interpersonal tasks (cleaning a hotel room, taking care of an elderly person, serving food) that,
despite advances in robotics, remain difficult to automate at scale. Middle-skill jobs, by contrast, often
involved routine procedures that machines handle well – hence their decline.
One striking milestone underscoring this shift: in the United States, by 2008 employment in the leisure
and hospitality sector (restaurants, hotels, etc.) surpassed employment in manufacturing . This27

symbolic crossover represented a substitution of traditionally lower-wage service jobs for what used to be
higher-wage factory jobs. And indeed, the workers themselves often had to make that switch – displaced
manufacturing workers frequently ended up in service roles. The consequence for wages was severe : the
average worker in leisure and hospitality earns 58% less  than the average manufacturing worker in the U.S.,
as of recent data . Thus, when someone loses a manufacturing job and takes a job at a restaurant or
hotel, they suffer a steep drop in income on average . This dynamic has been a major contributor to
regional economic distress (e.g., in former industrial towns) and to the stagnation of incomes for workers
without higher education.
Meanwhile,  the  growth  of  “knowledge  economy”  jobs  has  benefited  those  with  higher  education  and
specialized skills. Sectors like tech and finance expanded with the help of technology (they create and use
the latest tech) and have been able to pay premium salaries. However , even in some of these sectors,
automation is now making inroads . For example, algorithmic trading reduced the need for as many
traders  in  finance;  automated  coding  tools  can  make  software  engineers  more  productive  (potentially
reducing the total number needed for a project); and AI-driven diagnostic tools are beginning to assist
(though not yet replace) professionals in law and medicine. Until recently, the consensus was that high-
education  jobs  were  complemented  by  technology  (making  those  workers  more  productive  and  thus
increasing demand for them), whereas only low/medium-skill jobs were substituted. But as AI grows more
sophisticated, even some high-skill jobs have parts that can be automated . 
Nonetheless, the dominant story of the late 20th century was a shift from goods-producing to service-
providing employment , and within services, a polarization between high-wage and low-wage work.  Job
polarization  has been documented in the U.S. and across numerous European economies . For
example, a study by MIT economist David Autor found that in the U.S., from 1979 to 2012, employment in
middle-wage  occupations  fell  significantly  as  a  share  of  total  jobs,  while  low-wage  and  high-wage
occupations increased their shares . The driving factor identified is  routine task automation : jobs
heavy in routine manual or cognitive tasks (which were prevalent in manufacturing, clerical, and sales) saw
employment contractions, whereas jobs requiring either high-level problem solving or physical presence
and dexterity (personal services) grew . European research similarly points to technology (along with
globalization) as key in reducing mid-level jobs like craftspeople, machine operators, and clerical workers
.
In  sum,  successive  waves  of  technology  have  continually  reshaped  the  occupational  structure:  first
replacing many blue-collar jobs, then automating white-collar routine work, and now encroaching further
into skilled domains. Each wave has tended to shift labor demand downward (toward lower-paid jobs) or
upward (toward a smaller number of very high-paid jobs), but has hollowed out the middle . This has
far-reaching implications for wages and inequality, which we will discuss later in the context of labor’s
bargaining power and job quality.
Before  that,  we  turn  to  another  critical  aspect  of  the  modern  economy  that  ties  technology  to  labor
outcomes: the emergence of “superstar firms”  and the decoupling of corporate success from employment.32

The Rise of Superstar Firms and the Decoupling of Employment
from Output
One of the paradoxes of today’s economy is that we see  companies reaching unprecedented size and
profitability, yet employing relatively few people  compared to the industrial giants of the past. Advances
in technology – particularly digital technology – have enabled firms to scale up revenues and market reach
with far less labor input. This has led to the phenomenon of “superstar firms”: highly productive, highly
profitable companies that capture large market shares while employing a comparatively small workforce.
The rise of such firms is both a  result  of technological dynamics and a  cause  of further shifts in labor’s
fortunes.
High Output, Low Headcount: A New Corporate Model
Consider  this  striking  comparison:  In  1979,  General  Motors  (GM)  –  an  icon  of  industrial  capitalism  –
employed about 840,000 workers  and earned substantial profits (1979 was near GM’s peak year) .
Fast-forward to 2012: Google (now Alphabet), a leading tech company, had less than 5% of GM’s workforce
(around 38,000 employees)  yet generated 20% more in inflation-adjusted earnings than GM did at its
peak . In other words, Google was  more profitable  than GM had ever been, despite having a tiny
fraction of the number of employees. This example encapsulates the stark decoupling of employment from
corporate value in the modern era. GM’s success in 1979 provided middle-class incomes to hundreds of
thousands  of  families  (and  indirectly  supported  many  more  in  supply  chains  and  local  communities).
Google’s success in 2012 (and even more so today) enriches its much smaller pool of employees and
shareholders, with far fewer direct jobs created. One analysis framed it this way: GM in 1979 provided
income to support an estimated 2.5 million people (workers and their families), whereas Google in 2012
supported perhaps 114,000 people by the same measure – GM provided roughly 21 times more people
with a decent living  than Google did, even though Google made more money . 
This shift is not just about comparing two companies – it reflects a broad economy-wide trend. Research by
economists David Autor and others finds that across many industries, especially since the 1980s, sales have
become more concentrated in a small number of  “winner-takes-most” firms . These leading firms
often have higher productivity and profit margins but lower labor share  – they simply don’t spend as
much on wages relative to their output . As a result, when they capture larger market share, the overall
share of income going to labor in that industry falls . Autor et al. (2020) document this pattern in the U.S.
Economic Census data: industries where concentration increased the most saw the largest declines in
labor’s share of value-added , largely because output shifted to firms that operate at high productivity with
fewer workers . This “superstar firm” effect has been empirically linked to the aggregate drop in labor
share in the U.S. and other countries . In plain terms,  today’s leading companies can generate
enormous revenues with a skeleton crew of workers, thanks to technology , and as those companies
account for a bigger slice of the economy, fewer overall workers reap the benefits of that output. 
We can see this in concrete metrics like  revenue per employee , which has skyrocketed in tech-driven
sectors. For instance, Apple – the world’s largest company by market capitalization – generated about $2.4
million in revenue per employee in 2024 . Many other tech or finance firms routinely post six-figure or
seven-figure revenues per employee. By contrast, large employers of the past (and present in traditional
sectors) like automakers or retailers have revenue per employee in the low hundreds of thousands or even
tens of thousands. This indicates that tech-rich firms require far less human labor to create value. In3839

extreme cases, some highly digital companies earn  millions of dollars per employee  (e.g. certain software
firms or payment platforms), whereas labor-intensive businesses like hospitals or hospitality might earn
only $50,000–$100,000 per employee. Technology has enabled a small workforce to leverage software,
automation, and intellectual property to serve millions of customers  – something not possible in older
industries that needed a worker for every incremental unit of production or service.
Another aspect of superstar firms is their  market power and profit margins . Leading tech firms often
enjoy high markups and dominant platforms, which allow them to capture value without needing to add
employees proportionally. For example, once software is written, distributing it to more customers doesn’t
require lots more workers – it’s infinitely replicable at near-zero cost. This is fundamentally different from,
say, manufacturing a car or serving a meal, which scales with labor . The consequence is that many of
today’s largest firms simply don’t create mass employment the way industrial giants did in the mid-20th
century. Amazon  might be an exception in terms of headcount (it employs over a million, though many in
low-wage fulfillment center roles), but companies like  Google, Facebook (Meta), Microsoft, Apple,  etc.,
employ on the order of tens or hundreds of thousands, not millions. Even outside tech, industries have
consolidated: a few big box retail chains dominate instead of numerous small shops, employing fewer
people per dollar of sales through efficiencies and centralized distribution. 
The macro-level implication  of these changes is a further weakening of labor’s position. In an economy
dominated by a few mega-firms, workers have fewer employers to bargain with (potentially depressing
competition for labor). And if those firms operate at high productivity with relatively lean staffing, overall
labor demand is reduced . A recent OECD working paper noted that countries with falling labor shares have
witnessed  both  declines  at  the  technological  frontier  (leading  firms  reducing  labor  share)  and a
reallocation of market share toward these low-labor-share “winner takes most” firms . This
suggests that technological dynamism – the ability of top firms to out-produce others with less labor –
rather  than  just  anti-competitive  forces,  has  driven  the  trend .  In  other  words,  it’s  not  simply
monopolistic behavior , but genuine tech-enabled efficiency, that is concentrating output. However , from the
perspective of workers, the result is similar: fewer jobs created per unit of output, and a smaller slice of
income going to wages .
To illustrate, if we imagine a simplified scenario: In 1970, 10 companies each employ 10,000 workers and
each has 10% of an industry output. In 2020, perhaps 2 superstar companies have 80% of the industry
between them, each employing 15,000 workers, and a few niche firms have the rest. Industry output might
have doubled, but total industry employment might have fallen. Productivity per firm soared, profits soared,
but jobs are lost. This is essentially what has happened in many sectors (though simplified). The economy
can grow (due to high productivity firms) without a proportional increase in workers or wages – a stark
break from assumptions of earlier decades that GDP growth and job growth go hand in hand.
It’s  important  to  note  that  technology  both  enables  and  reinforces  this  concentration .  Superior
technology gives an edge (better product or lower cost), leading to higher market share for the leader; with
scale, that firm can invest even more in technology, creating a widening gap. Smaller competitors either go
niche or disappear , often leading to layoffs or lower wages in those firms. This virtuous (for the firm) or
vicious (for the worker) cycle means the spoils of innovation are not evenly distributed. 
In summary, the  “superstar firm” economy is one where technology amplifies the reach of a small
labor force to generate outsized output , contributing to a decoupling between the fortunes of companies
(or the stock market) and the condition of the average worker . This trend dovetails with the falling labor3745

share and rising capital share discussed earlier: as superstar firms account for more of GDP and inherently
have a low labor share, the aggregate labor share drops . It also helps explain how we can have
booming profits and GDP alongside tepid wage growth and fewer good jobs: the gains of tech-driven
growth are concentrated in a narrow segment of the economy – the owners of capital and a relatively small
cadre of highly-skilled workers who run those tech engines.
We will next examine specific case studies of how recent automation technologies  have directly displaced
jobs, as well as how the balance of job creation versus destruction is playing out in the current era of AI.
These cases will put a finer point on the macro trends by looking at concrete instances of labor being
supplanted by machines or algorithms.
Automation in Action: Case Studies from RPA to Generative AI
Thus far , we have discussed broad patterns and historical shifts. Here, we focus on concrete case studies of
automation technologies  and their observed or expected effects on labor in developed economies. These
examples illustrate the mechanisms by which technology can erode labor demand in specific contexts:
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) in Business Operations
One of the less visible but widespread automation trends of the past decade has been the adoption of
Robotic Process Automation (RPA)  in corporate back offices. RPA involves software “bots” that perform
repetitive, rules-based tasks across computer systems – essentially a digital workforce handling things like
data entry, invoice processing, payroll, customer account updates, and other standardized workflows. Many
large organizations (banks, insurance companies, telecom firms, government agencies) have implemented
RPA to increase efficiency in their operations departments.
The  consequence for employment  in those functions is a reduction in the need for human clerks and
support staff. For example, a bank that installs RPA for loan processing can handle a higher volume of loan
applications with fewer loan officers or processors. While companies often claim they redeploy workers to
higher-value  activities,  the  net  effect  is  frequently  hiring  less  than  they  otherwise  would,  or  allowing
attrition to shrink the workforce. A cited case: Deutsche Bank  introduced RPA in areas like compliance and
transaction processing and reported automating 30–70% of certain tasks where the software was applied
.  While  the  bank  publicly  projected  that  robots  would  “complement”  humans  rather  than  outright
replace them, reports suggested plans to reduce headcount substantially after automation – one 2017
report indicated Deutsche Bank’s then-CEO envisioned cutting around 10,000 jobs  as part of automation
and cost-saving efforts (nearly one in five staff at the time) . This underscores that even if companies
avoid using the word “layoffs,” the intention of RPA is clearly to reduce labor requirements  in routine office
jobs.
Across the banking industry broadly, analysts have predicted large job impacts from automation. A Citibank
analysis in 2016 made headlines by estimating that about 30% of banking jobs could be eliminated by
2025  due  to  automation  of  retail  banking  and  other  functions .  They  dubbed  it  “Banking’s  Uber
Moment” – suggesting a disruptive change where digital apps, ATMs, and AI-driven systems replace much
human labor in branches and call centers . Front-line bank tellers and office support roles were expected
to bear the brunt as customers move to mobile banking and banks use automated software for everything
from fraud detection to loan underwriting. Indeed, since the mid-2010s, many large banks have steadily
reduced their branch networks and staff, while investing heavily in fintech. While new tech-related jobs have4143
46

11
been created (data analysts, compliance specialists, etc.), the net effect is that fewer total employees are
needed to service the same number of customers . As one article summarized, “Automation has many
industries concerned – and now there’s a target painted on bank workers’ backs,” noting the forecast of ~1
in 3 bank jobs potentially being cut  as people hand tasks to machines .
Beyond banking, RPA is used in insurance (claims processing), telecommunications (customer account
management), healthcare administration (billing and records), and more . Everywhere it’s applied, it
tends to substitute for lower to mid-skill office work. One study on the consequences of RPA in knowledge
work noted that when back-office tasks in finance were first automated, it involved things like moving data
between systems, processing invoices, etc., which clearly reduced the need for staff to do those manual
electronic tasks . As RPA technology matures, its capabilities expand (especially when combined with AI
for semi-structured tasks), encroaching further into what previously required a human decision. 
Importantly, RPA and similar automation often do not grab headlines the way factory robots do, because
the  changes  happen  behind  the  scenes.  But  the  aggregate  impact  is  visible  in  the  occupational
employment statistics we saw earlier (millions of office/support jobs vanishing) . It’s also reflected
in corporate language around “digital transformation” and “efficiency gains” – euphemisms that often entail
doing  more  with  fewer  employees.  Consulting  firms  promoting  RPA  frequently  cite  cost  savings  and
headcount reduction as benefits, even if the official line is that workers will be “freed to focus on higher-
value  tasks” .  The  reality  on  the  ground  is  that  many  workers  see  their  roles  eliminated  or
significantly changed. This pattern will likely continue as RPA adoption grows; indeed, a 2023 survey by IBM
found that 30% of back-office roles could be replaced by AI and automation in just five years  at that
company . IBM’s CEO announced a pause in hiring for certain support positions and projected roughly
7,800 jobs could be replaced by AI  in the near term, particularly in HR and other non-customer-facing
functions . This is a concrete example of a major employer explicitly planning around the assumption
that automation will allow them to operate with significantly fewer people in certain departments.
AI and Generative AI: A New Wave of White-Collar Automation
If  RPA  represents  the  incremental  automation  of  routine  digital  tasks,  the  advent  of  AI  –  especially
“generative”  AI  like  large  language  models  (e.g.  GPT-4)  –  signals  a  more  profound  potential
substitution for human labor , including in cognitive and creative domains. In the past few years, AI
systems have demonstrated the ability to draft emails and reports, write computer code, create marketing
copy, analyze and summarize documents, generate graphics, and even advise on strategy (albeit with
varying reliability). This has led to growing expectations (and fears) that many knowledge workers could
have their jobs significantly changed or even displaced by AI in the coming decade .
Early signs of this are emerging. In mid-2023, the CEO of IBM mentioned above took action by  freezing
hiring  for  roles  like  HR  specialists ,  precisely  because  those  jobs  involve  relatively  structured  tasks
(processing paperwork, basic queries) that AI could handle . He estimated that about 30% of such roles
could be automated within 5 years  – implying thousands of positions the company would no longer need
to fill . IBM’s move made headlines because it was one of the first large companies to publicly connect a
hiring decision to AI’s capabilities. But IBM is likely not alone. Surveys indicate many CEOs and executives
are exploring how AI can improve efficiency, which often boils down to labor savings. For instance, in
customer service, AI chatbots  are rapidly being deployed to answer routine customer queries, reducing the
need for large call center teams. Some companies have reported being able to handle a significant portion
of customer interactions with AI, handing off to humans only the more complex issues.5049

The scale of AI’s potential impact was highlighted by a 2023 analysis from Goldman Sachs, which estimated
that the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs globally could be affected by generative AI  automation
of tasks . They projected that in the United States and Europe, AI could automate roughly one-fourth of
current work tasks across all jobs . While not all those tasks equate to job losses (some will augment
workers rather than replace them), the figure underscores how broadly AI could change labor demand. The
bank noted that legal, administrative, and engineering sectors are among those with high “exposure” to AI –
meaning a high share of their tasks could be done by AI . If these predictions hold even partially true, it
suggests  that  tens  of  millions  of  jobs  in  advanced  economies  might  be  eliminated  or  significantly
downgraded due to AI in the coming years.
Some concrete examples of where AI is already displacing work: Media and content creation  – outlets like
news websites experimented with AI-written articles (some, like CNET, had to pause due to accuracy issues,
but the intent was fewer human writers needed).  Programming  – AI coding assistants (GitHub’s Copilot,
etc.) can generate code for routine functions, potentially reducing demand for junior software developers.
Graphic design and marketing  – AI image generators and copywriters can produce basic designs and ad
text quickly, threatening entry-level roles in those fields. Customer support  – AI systems can handle chat
and email support queries, leading companies to scale back hiring of support agents. There have been
anecdotal  reports  of  companies  laying  off  content  moderation  or  customer  service  teams  after
implementing AI tools (though often they cite other reasons). Even in more specialized fields like law and
consulting, AI can draft legal briefs or analyze data far faster than any paralegal or junior analyst, hinting at
future staff reductions in those areas. 
It is important to stress that AI’s impact is just beginning  – unlike manufacturing robots, which have been
around for decades, generative AI only hit mainstream capability around 2022–2023. So the direct job losses
attributable to it so far are limited. However , companies are clearly anticipating changes: A 2023 Bloomberg
survey of executives found over 50% were planning to implement AI in ways that would likely result in
reduced workforce needs. Already, in the tech sector itself, we saw major firms like Meta, Microsoft, and
others announce layoffs in 2023 even as they increased investments in AI – suggesting a reorientation of
staff and a belief that new AI tools could maintain output with fewer people.
One of the highest-profile early signals was the  Chegg  case: Chegg, an education technology company,
warned that the emergence of ChatGPT was reducing student demand for its services; its stock plunged
and it indicated it might need to pivot its business model – an indirect effect on employment (fewer tutors
or support staff needed if students flock to free AI help). Similarly, the freelance market has been disrupted:
clients who might hire a human copywriter or illustrator are now trying AI tools first. This could hollow out
gig-economy jobs  in content writing, design, translation, etc., which many people in advanced economies
rely on for income.
The overall point is that the latest automation wave driven by AI is moving beyond routine tasks into
fields that were previously considered “safe” from automation  due to requiring human judgment or
creativity. While AI is not yet at human-level general intelligence, it can perform a surprising variety of work-
related tasks to a satisfactory degree. This raises the likelihood that labor demand for many white-collar
occupations will shrink . The tech industry itself may ironically become less labor-intensive: for example,
one tech CEO noted that with AI coding assistance, perhaps a smaller engineering team could accomplish
the same product development, meaning companies won’t need to hire as many programmers. Over time,
if each skilled professional’s productivity is greatly amplified by AI, employers might hire fewer of them (the56

exact “lump of labor” outcome mainstream economists often dismiss, but which can hold in specific skill
categories if technology does a large share of the work).
It must be noted that new technologies like AI also spur  new job categories  – for instance, “prompt
engineering” or AI model training specialists – but these tend to be niche and require advanced skills, and
are far fewer in number than the broad swath of jobs potentially affected. We will examine in the next
section how the balance of job destruction vs. creation is playing out in aggregate. 
Before moving on, let us briefly highlight that even  physical automation and AI in service sectors  is
advancing.  Examples  include  self-checkout  kiosks  in  retail  (reducing  cashiers),  autonomous  vehicles  in
transportation  (threatening  driving  jobs  once  fully  realized),  and  warehouse  robots  (reducing  manual
picking labor). Amazon’s warehouses, for instance, use thousands of robots, which hasn’t stopped Amazon
from hiring many workers but has meant each worker handles more output than they would without
automation. Some retailers now run stores with primarily self-service and minimal staff (Amazon Go stores,
etc.). Fast-food chains are piloting automated kitchens or ordering systems that could cut down on staff.
These innovations are still in early adoption, but as costs fall and tech improves, they could lead to further
labor displacement in sectors that employ large numbers of low-skill workers. This, combined with the
white-collar automation discussed, presents a scenario where  both ends of the occupational spectrum
face pressure  – potentially a recipe for much slower overall labor demand growth than population growth. 
Having looked at specific technologies and cases, we now turn to the broader dynamic of displacement
versus creation . Does technology create as many jobs as it destroys? Mainstream economics historically
says yes, but emerging evidence suggests we may be in a new phase where that is no longer guaranteed.
Displacement vs. Creation: Are New Jobs Keeping Pace with
Automation?
A core question in the debate over technology and employment is whether the jobs eliminated by tech
advances are offset (or exceeded) by new jobs created because of  those advances. The traditional optimistic
view, supported by historical anecdotes, is that technology may automate certain tasks but also creates new
industries and demands for labor – from the weavers put out of work by mechanical looms eventually
finding new occupations in textile design or retail, to switchboard operators replaced by automated dialing
who might become customer service reps for the phone company, and so on. Indeed, it is often pointed out
that many jobs in today’s economy (web developers, DNA lab technicians, digital marketers, etc.) did not
exist decades ago  – evidence of technology’s creative force. A recent study quantifying this found that
about  60% of current jobs in the U.S. are in occupations that were newly created since 1940 . That is an
astounding figure, highlighting the dynamic churn of the labor market. In the long run, according to this
narrative, technology has been a net creator of jobs  – even as it destroyed old occupations, it opened
doors to new ones that absorbed the growing workforce.
However , as noted earlier ,  there is growing evidence that this balance has tilted in recent decades
toward net displacement . MIT’s David Autor and colleagues conducted research separating job changes
into those due to “automation” of tasks and those due to the creation of “new tasks” (augmentation). They
found that particularly since 1980, the rate of automation has outpaced the rate of new task creation in the U.S.
. In other words,  technology has been replacing more jobs than it’s been generating  in the more recent
period . This aligns with the earlier observation of sluggish employment growth and the productivity-pay31
1
34
34
14
divergence. Autor summarized the findings: “there does appear to be a faster rate of automation, and a
slower rate of augmentation, in the last four decades (1980 to present) than in the four decades prior” .
They developed a methodology using historical census data and text analysis of patents to actually measure
how many jobs were lost vs. created by tech changes over time – something that was previously hard to
quantify. The results confirmed suspicions that many had:  the last few decades have not seen the same
magnitude of new job creation as past technological leaps did . 
Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019) formalize this concept with the “task content of production” framework. In
their framework, automation  is defined as machines taking over tasks previously done by workers – this
produces a displacement effect  that always reduces the labor share and can reduce total labor demand
. The countervailing force is the creation of new tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage
– a  reinstatement effect  that  increases labor demand and labor’s share . Historically, they note, the
introduction  of  entirely  new  job  categories  (from  automobile  repairmen  in  the  early  1900s  to  IT
professionals in the late 20th century) has been crucial in keeping labor demand growing. But if the pace of
new task creation slows while automation accelerates, the result can be stagnating or even declining net
labor demand . Their empirical analysis for the U.S. from the 1980s to 2016 suggests exactly that:  an
acceleration in displacement (especially in manufacturing) and a weakening of new task creation, alongside
slower productivity growth, account for the much slower employment growth of the last few decades . In
plainer terms, the economy has not been inventing new jobs fast enough to replace those lost to technology  in
recent times.
Why might the recent period be different from, say, 100 years ago? One reason could be the nature of
modern technology: general-purpose digital technologies can be applied very broadly  across industries,
automating a wide array of tasks all at once (especially as AI improves). By contrast, older technologies
rolled out more gradually and often created whole new industries even as they displaced others. For
example, the mechanization of agriculture in the early 20th century freed workers who then could go into
manufacturing (which was booming at the same time). Manufacturing in turn eventually released workers
who moved into services, which expanded with new roles. But now, we have technology simultaneously
making inroads into manufacturing (robots), services (AI and software), and even creative fields. The scope
of automation has widened, meaning  the pool of potentially affected jobs is enormous . At the same
time, it’s not obvious what the next “engine of job creation” is – we don’t see yet a huge new labor-intensive
sector on the horizon that could absorb millions of workers (some point to the green economy or elder
care, but those come with constraints or are often smaller scale).
Another factor is globalization  and the “great doubling” of the global labor force after 1990 . While
not a technology per se, globalization was enabled by technology (container shipping, telecommunications,
the  internet),  and  it  created  effective  labor  abundance  that  reduced  incentives  to  create  labor-saving
technologies in some domains (why automate if you can offshore to cheap labor?) but increased the impact
of  labor-saving  tech  in  advanced  economies  (since  offshoring  itself  is  a  form  of  labor  arbitrage  or
substitution). The integration of China, India, and the former Soviet bloc  doubled the available global
workforce for multinational firms . This huge increase in labor supply put downward pressure on
wages and employment in tradable sectors in the West, akin to a massive labor-displacing shock (though in
this case it “displaced” jobs to other countries rather than to machines). Some economists argue this labor
glut and offshoring wave worked in tandem  with automation – e.g., factories relocated overseas and also
automated, a one-two punch for Western manufacturing workers.58

Regardless, the outcome observed is that  labor markets in developed countries have experienced a
sustained period of slack and wage suppression despite economic growth , indicating demand for labor
has not kept up with supply. Labor force participation declines  (especially among men in prime age, and
youth in some countries) are one symptom. For example, in the U.S., participation among prime-age men
fell steadily over decades as mentioned, and even women’s participation leveled off and declined slightly
after 2000 . Many who left manufacturing or other declining sectors did not find new jobs easily and
some exited the workforce altogether (an issue particularly acute in parts of the U.S. and UK, less so in
some European social welfare states where policies differ). This stands in contrast to the mid-century period
when, broadly speaking, if one sector shed workers, another was growing to absorb them (plus overall
population was younger and labor demand was robust).
It’s instructive to examine  net employment growth vs. population growth . In the three decades from
1990 to 2020, the U.S. population grew by roughly 90 million (35%), but employment grew by only about 60
million (around 50%) – meaning the employment-to-population ratio actually declined after accounting for
demographic  composition  (and  aging  doesn’t  fully  explain  it,  as  prime-age  ratios  fell  too).  Europe’s
population growth was slower , but many countries saw minimal net employment gains outside of boom/
bust cycles, with unemployment remaining structurally high in some (e.g., much of the 1990s in continental
Europe).  Japan’s  population  peaked  in  2000s  and  its  workforce  shrank,  but  that  masked  underlying
underemployment issues and was cushioned by a culture of keeping people employed often regardless of
productivity. In short,  the trend across advanced economies has been that it’s becoming harder to
maintain full employment without slack  – a hallmark of insufficient labor demand. 
The job polarization effect  further complicates the picture: even if, say, 100 routine jobs are lost and 100
new non-routine jobs are created, if the new jobs are either very high-skill (few people qualify) or very low-
wage (not attractive or sufficient), then matching workers to those jobs is problematic. This can result in
simultaneous  job  vacancies  and unemployment  –  a  skills  mismatch.  That  has  been  observed  in  some
countries;  for  instance,  unfilled  vacancies  in  IT  or  nursing  coexisting  with  unemployed  manufacturing
workers who lack the qualifications or means to transition. 
Another issue is geography : Tech-driven job gains often concentrate in certain urban hubs (Silicon Valley,
Seattle, London, etc.), whereas job losses from automation (like in manufacturing or clerical work) are more
spread across different regions, including rural or small-town areas. This leads to regional disparities where
some areas prosper and others decline, and workers cannot or do not all migrate to the booming areas
(due to housing costs, community ties, etc.). Thus, even if on paper new jobs equal jobs lost, the distribution
matters – and in many cases it has left pockets of high unemployment or dropout.
Now, it is important to address some counterarguments and nuances . Tech optimists would point out that
unemployment in many countries reached very low levels by the late 2010s (e.g., the U.S. was at 3.5%
unemployment in 2019, Germany around 3% in 2019, UK ~4%). Doesn’t that indicate that, ultimately, jobs
were created for those who wanted them? Superficially yes – but those low unemployment rates came after
long expansions and with the help of other factors (like very low interest rates spurring demand). They also
hide the labor force non-participation issue (people not counted in unemployment because they stopped
looking). For instance, the U.S. in 2019 had low unemployment, but labor force participation was ~63%,
down significantly from 67% in 2000 , meaning a smaller share of the population was engaged in
work. Many of those out of the labor force were less-educated men, a group heavily impacted by the
disappearance of mid-skill jobs. If we included some measure of “discouraged workers,” the picture would910
9
16
be less rosy. Additionally, underemployment  was prevalent – many were working part-time involuntarily or
in jobs below their skill level.
We saw earlier that  94% of net job growth in the U.S. from 2005 to 2015 was in “alternative work
arrangements” (gig, contract, temporary) , not traditional permanent jobs. This means a lot of people
ended up in more precarious positions. It’s not a stretch to suggest that if automation had not advanced as
much, perhaps more traditional jobs might have been available; instead the jobs that did appear were often
less secure. 
All this suggests that the labor market absorption of technological disruption in recent times has been
weaker than in the past . The evidence indicates that we are in a phase where net creation of jobs from
technology is slower . Indeed, aggregate employment growth in advanced economies has been modest
relative to GDP growth , meaning more output with fewer workers – a sign of high productivity but also of
labor-saving bias. Some economists refer to the current period as one of “jobless (or low-job) growth.” For
example, after the early 2000s recession, the U.S. took years to regain lost jobs even as output recovered
(“jobless recovery”), and after 2008 it was a long slog as well – suggesting many tasks eliminated during the
downturn were permanently automated or never rehired.
That said, counterarguments  remain. One might argue that new job creation is simply harder to measure or
takes time to emerge . For instance, the AI revolution might spawn entirely new industries we can’t yet
imagine (akin to how the internet eventually gave rise to e-commerce, social media jobs, etc.). It’s true that
forecasting future jobs is difficult – in 1900, nobody could foresee the rise of the IT sector , and in 1980 few
would predict millions of people would make a living as software developers or web designers by 2010.
There may well be jobs in, say,  renewable energy, AI maintenance, or biotech  that grow significantly.
However , to absorb tens of millions of workers, those sectors would have to grow labor-intensive or at least
neutral, which is not apparent yet (renewable energy is growing, but once built, solar farms don’t need
many workers; AI maintenance is itself a highly automated field; biotech can create jobs but often requires
high skills). 
Moreover , even when new categories arise, the key question is  the quality and remuneration of those
jobs  compared to the ones lost. Recent history shows many new jobs (e.g., ride-share driver , warehouse
fulfillment associate, content moderator) are relatively low paying or precarious, whereas many jobs lost
(e.g., union factory jobs, stable office careers) provided better wages/benefits. So there is an asymmetry:
technology may create jobs, but not necessarily like-for-like replacements  in terms of income or stability. This
contributes to inequality and a sense of insecurity among workers, even if they are technically “employed.”
We will delve into this in the next section on the qualitative aspects and distribution, but it’s worth noting
here that the debate is not only about quantity of jobs but also their quality .
To  sum  up,  a  growing  body  of  research  and  data  challenges  the  idea  that  technology  will  inevitably
generate  enough  new  employment  to  compensate  for  its  displacement  of  workers.  Evidence  from
approximately 1980 onward shows an imbalance: significant automation-driven job losses and task
elimination, with weaker compensatory job creation . The result has been slower labor demand
growth,  manifested  in  phenomena  like  jobless  recoveries,  declining  labor  force  participation,  and  the
proliferation of low-wage work even in rich economies. This sets the stage for examining why conventional
measures (like headline employment rates or GDP growth) might give a false sense of security, and why
many workers feel left behind despite positive macro indicators. 4

In the next section, we will confront the counterarguments and the “aggregate job growth” narrative
directly, and then explore how the changing nature of jobs – and an oversupply of labor – has favored
capital over labor .
Counterarguments and the Hidden Realities of Technological
Impact
It is important to address the counterarguments and mainstream perspectives  head-on, to understand
where they come from and why they might be misleading or incomplete in the current context. The pro-
technology orthodoxy often cites several points:
Historical Resilience of Employment:  Despite waves of panic (the Luddites in 1811, automation
fears in the 1960s, etc.), employment has kept growing over the long run. Today, more people are
employed  worldwide  than  ever ,  and  standards  of  living  are  higher .  The  argument  is  that  each
innovation creates new opportunities – for example, the ATM did not destroy bank teller jobs as
feared; instead, banks opened more branches and tellers shifted to customer service roles, and
overall bank employment held up. Similarly, personal computers eliminated typing pools but created
the IT industry with millions of jobs. The underlying faith is in human adaptability and the limitless
nature of human wants – if productivity increases, we’ll find new things for people to do.
Low Unemployment and Job Creation Statistics:  In many developed countries, unemployment is
at or near historical lows (bar disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic). The U.S. pre-pandemic
unemployment  under  4%  was  touted  as  effectively  “full  employment.”  Even  after  massive
technological change since the 1980s, most people who want jobs have them. Additionally, job
openings  in  certain  sectors  (tech,  healthcare)  exceed  qualified  candidates,  suggesting  tech  is
creating a skills shortage , not surplus, in those areas. Proponents also point to the proliferation of
new  job  titles :  app  developer ,  data  scientist,  social  media  manager  –  none  of  which  existed  a
generation ago. This, they argue, demonstrates that technology is constantly spawning new lines of
work.
Productivity Gains and Consumer Benefits:  Higher productivity from technology leads to lower
prices or new products, which means consumers have more disposable income to spend elsewhere,
generating jobs in those other areas. For instance, cheaper automobiles due to factory automation
freed consumer money which might be spent on tourism, creating jobs in hospitality. The aggregate
effect is a richer society where people can afford more services – and services are often labor-
intensive,  thus  boosting  employment.  This  is  essentially  the  classical  economic  argument  of
technological progress leading to a reallocation of labor to sectors where there is increased demand
(sometimes called the compensation effect  through lower prices, higher real incomes, etc.). 
Human Creativity and Complementarity:  Many experts believe that  humans will always find
tasks to do that complement machines  – that AI and automation, rather than wholesale replacing
us, will mostly augment our capabilities. They foresee a future of “human-AI teams”  where AI does
the routine grunt work and humans focus on creative, interpersonal, or complex analytical tasks that
machines aren’t good at. Thus, workers could become more productive (and presumably earn more)
by leveraging AI, similar to how an accountant who uses Excel is far more productive than one using
paper ledgers, but still remains employed doing accounting (just at a higher level). This line of1.

18
thinking suggests that new skills and roles will develop for humans in synergy with technology (for
example, managing AI systems, providing the human touch in automated services, crafting creative
strategies using AI outputs, etc.).
Historical Wage Growth and Living Standards:  It’s also argued that even if some wages stagnated,
overall living standards have risen due to technology making goods and services cheaper/better . So
while a factory worker’s wage might not rise, they benefit from cheap electronics, longer lifespans
(due to medical tech), and so on. In mainstream models, eventually wages should catch up with
productivity – if they haven’t, some say it’s due to non-tech factors like globalization or policy, not an
inherent tech issue.
Now, each of these points has validity in certain contexts or timeframes. But the  analysis in preceding
sections reveals cracks in these optimistic narratives :
Employment numbers vs. Quality:  Yes, unemployment was low in 2019, for example, but consider
what kinds of jobs people were in . A large number were in low-wage, unstable jobs. The fact that
someone is “employed” by gigging for Uber Eats 15 hours a week while wanting full-time work is not
a success of technological progress; it’s arguably a reflection of lack of better opportunities. As we
noted,  94% of net new jobs from 2005–2015 were alternative work arrangements  (temp, gig,
etc.) , a startling statistic that suggests the traditional job has given way to a more precarious
model for many. Headline unemployment also ignores those not actively looking . In the U.S., prime-
age male non-participation hit record highs; many of these men are not counted in unemployment
but are effectively without work (some on disability, some just dropped out). There are sociological
studies  of  these  men  (“Men  Without  Work”)  linking  their  loss  of  employment  (due  in  part  to
automation and trade) to issues like opioid addiction and social decay. So the low unemployment
rate  masked  a  lot  of  hidden  unemployment  or  underemployment .  Europe  similarly  has
underemployment  (people  wanting  full-time  but  only  getting  part-time,  etc.)  and  until  recently
higher official unemployment especially among youth in some countries – again partially a result of
insufficient growth of good jobs.
New jobs exist, but how many and for whom?  Yes, there are app developers and data scientists
now, but these are relatively small in number and require high education. The median worker cannot
easily pivot to these roles. In the U.S., only about a third of adults have a bachelor’s degree. Telling
an unemployed factory or office worker in their 50s to learn coding and become a data scientist is
not very realistic at scale. The distributional aspect  is key: tech has been great for the highly skilled
(who often enjoy wage premiums), but for the rest, it often means accepting lower-skilled service
work. Some data even shows a  downgrading of educational job matches  – e.g., many college
graduates now end up in jobs that historically did not require degrees (driving taxis, baristas),
indicating a saturation of high-skill job openings relative to supply of educated workers. This can be
partly due to credential creep, but also simply because the number of top-tier jobs is limited. Not
everyone can be a software engineer or biomedical researcher; someone still ends up stocking
shelves or cleaning, and if those are the only jobs growing for those without advanced degrees, then
that’s where they go, often with stagnant pay.
Productivity gains not translating to wages:  The mainstream would say productivity ultimately
raises wages, but the  decoupling since the late 1970s refutes that . If technology were
truly benefiting labor broadly, we would see wages rising in line with productivity. Instead, we see a5.

19
divergence: productivity up, median wages flat, implying that productivity gains are being captured
as profits or by top earners. This suggests that the complementarity story has broken down –
technology is no longer broadly complementing the average worker; in many cases it’s replacing or
bypassing them. Even where workers use technology, the gains have been siphoned off (due to
weakened bargaining power of labor , globalization, etc.).  So the mere presence of productivity
growth does not ensure worker gains  – it matters who has the leverage to claim those gains. In
recent decades, that has been capital owners and highly skilled specialists, not the median worker .
Adaptive possibility vs. speed of change:  Historically, labor markets did adjust, but often over
generations. Farmers moved to cities over decades, not overnight. The industrial revolution caused
enormous social upheaval and it took many decades and deliberate policies (and unrest) to reach a
new equilibrium. Today, the pace of technological change is arguably faster and more pervasive. If AI
in the next 10 years can truly perform a huge range of jobs, the question is can society adapt that
quickly to create entire new avenues for tens of millions of displaced workers? The optimistic view
assumes  yes,  but  that’s  a  gamble;  we  might  instead  see  a  long  period  of  dislocation.  Some
economists warn that even if the long-run outcome is new job creation, the transition could be very
painful , with a “lost generation” of workers who never find their footing.
Jobs numbers vs. hours and income:  Another subtle issue is that even if the number of people
employed stays high, the total hours of work  or total compensation  might not. For example, two part-
time gig jobs might replace one full-time job; employment count stays 2 vs 1 (so looks like more
jobs), but total hours worked could be the same or less, and benefits/security are worse. If many are
piecing together multiple gigs, we might double-count employment. In some countries, people hold
multiple jobs to make ends meet – again, giving illusion of more jobs created. What really matters to
living standards is total labor income going to the non-rich. We saw that labor’s share of income
fell , meaning even if jobs exist, the slice of economic pie going to workers (especially average
workers) shrank. This is a critical concealed fact behind healthy employment rates – those jobs
command a smaller share of output than before.
Sectoral shifts and hidden unemployment:  When manufacturing collapsed in the Rust Belt, the
unemployment rate eventually went down – but partly because people left those regions or stopped
looking or took much worse jobs. The distress is not captured by the neat unemployment figure.
Similarly, rural and small-town decline across the U.K. or US is not captured by national employment
stats – many left-behind places have low official unemployment because young people moved out or
many  are  on  disability.  Thus,  aggregate  statistics  can  hide  geographical  and  demographic
concentrated pain .
Technology as one factor among many:  Mainstream arguments often attribute wage stagnation
and inequality more to globalization or policy (decline of unions, eroded minimum wage, etc.) than
to  technology.  Indeed,  all  these  factors  are  intertwined.  However ,  technology  facilitated
globalization  (the  container  ship  and  the  internet  made  offshoring  feasible  at  scale),  and
technology contributed to union decline (e.g., automation reduced unionized factory jobs; also, the
threat of automation can weaken unions’ bargaining stance). So it’s hard to cleanly separate causes.
But increasingly, economists like Acemoglu have argued that the  direction of technological change
itself  has been a choice that favored automation over creating labor-friendly innovations . For
instance, in healthcare, we invested a lot in automating back-office billing (cutting clerical jobs) but
relatively less in innovations that would make nurses or primary care more effective (and thus•

increase demand for those roles). This argument posits that the  automation bias in R&D  (partly
driven by tax incentives and cheap capital) skewed tech progress against labor .
Given these considerations, the  headline job numbers can be seen as concealing distributional and
qualitative issues . As noted, one key issue is wage distribution . Virtually all the income growth of the past
decades went to the top 10% or even 1% of earners . For example, between 1979 and 2013, real annual
wages of the bottom 90% of U.S. workers rose only about 15%, whereas wages of the top 1% rose 138% .
This  stark  inequality  correlates  with  technology  since  high  earners  are  often  those  who  can  leverage
technology (e.g., finance professionals using algorithms, superstar CEOs in tech, highly educated engineers)
or  those  who  control  capital.  Meanwhile,  low  and  middle  earners  saw  very  small  gains  –  in  fact,  when
adjusting for inflation properly, many saw declines in real pay. In some countries like Germany, median
wages were flat from 2000 to 2015 until very recently when they ticked up due to labor scarcity (and
deliberate policy). In the UK, real wages in 2020 were roughly at 2007 levels – a “lost decade” of wage
growth, partly due to a surge of labor supply from Eastern Europe and tech constraints on jobs. Japan’s
median wage is lower than in the 1990s. So the wage stagnation story is broad-based across advanced
economies  to  varying  degrees,  not  just  a  U.S.  phenomenon  (though  the  U.S.  is  an  extreme  case  in
inequality).
Job quality degradation  is another hidden issue. A job is not just a job; factors like stability, benefits,
working conditions, and potential for growth matter . Technological and organizational innovations (like just-
in-time scheduling, gig platforms, etc.) have allowed companies to  shift to more flexible, on-demand
labor  models .  This  often  means  less  stable  hours  for  workers,  fewer  benefits  (since  gig  workers  are
contractors, not employees), and more risk shifted to workers (e.g., Uber drivers bear car depreciation, not
Uber). So even if unemployment is low, if a large proportion of those jobs are unstable or dead-end, workers
are worse off than in an era of plentiful stable jobs. Data shows declines in union membership  – e.g., the
U.S. went from ~20% unionized in 1983 to just 10% in 2022  – which is one proxy for job quality, as union
jobs tend to have better pay and benefits. Similarly, many European countries saw increased labor market
dualism : a core of protected jobs and a growing periphery of temporary or part-time workers (especially
among youth). For example, in Spain and Italy a huge share of young workers are on temporary contracts,
which often lead nowhere. This dualism is partly a result of trying to increase flexibility (often justified by
needing  to  adapt  to  technological  or  competitive  change),  but  it  has  created  a  generation  of  under-
employed youth. So looking at just employment rates misses that story.
Furthermore, multiple jobholding  has increased in some places. If one person has two jobs, that counts as
two in job statistics but is still one person working more to compensate for low wages. And multiple
jobholding often is indicative of not earning enough from one job, which speaks to wage issues.
Lastly, consider working hours and precarity : In some countries like the US, average hours for full-time
workers haven’t dropped (Americans work about as much or more than decades ago), whereas technology
was supposed to make life easier . The gains have instead been channeled into more output or profit, not
more leisure for all. In countries like Germany or France, work hours have reduced somewhat (due to policy
choices  like  more  vacation,  or  partial  employment  for  more  people),  but  they  still  have  persistent
unemployment or underemployment for youth historically. 
The bargaining power  of labor is a crucial underlying theme here and is the focus of our next section. But
clearly, a surplus of labor – whether from population growth, globalization, or automation –  weakens
workers’ ability to demand higher pay or better conditions . Companies can point to automation or65
65
66
21
offshoring as alternatives if workers push too hard: e.g., threatening to automate a plant if the union
doesn’t agree to wage cuts, or to move production abroad. This dynamic has played out repeatedly. For
instance, during contract negotiations, it’s not uncommon to hear , “if labor becomes too expensive, we’ll
invest in machines to do this.” Whether the threat is real or bluff, it places a ceiling on what workers feel
they can ask for . 
Therefore, even without mass unemployment, technology can exert  downward pressure on wages – a
phenomenon some call the “threat effect” of automation . Just as a high unemployment rate disciplines
workers (they fear being easily replaced), so does the credible threat of being replaced by a machine or
software. It’s been argued that this is one reason why despite low unemployment in late 2010s, wage
growth remained relatively subdued in some countries – because globalization and automation still loomed
as alternatives, keeping workers cautious and employers confident they didn’t need to raise pay much. 
In conclusion of this section, while the mainstream arguments highlight real positive aspects of technology,
they often ignore the distribution and power dimensions. Aggregate job and output figures might look fine,
but  underneath  lies  a  story  of  many  workers  getting  a  smaller  slice  of  the  pie  and  facing  more  job
instability. The “average” outcomes can mask severe disparities. As Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz
put it, we’ve been growing, but who benefits from growth is the question – and recently it’s been skewed.
Technology has played a role in that skewing by favoring certain skills and eroding others. 
Having  examined  these  hidden  realities,  we  now  turn  explicitly  to  the  question  of  labor  gluts  and
bargaining power : how an excess supply of labor , whether naturally through demographics or artificially
through automation, tilts the balance in favor of capital and what evidence we have for this dynamic in
developed economies.
Labor Gluts and the Erosion of Worker Bargaining Power
When the supply of labor exceeds the demand for labor , workers as a whole are in a weaker position to
negotiate wages and benefits. This basic principle of economics – surplus supply leads to lower price (in this
case,  the  price  of  labor ,  i.e.,  wages)  –  has  manifested  in  various  ways  in  developed  economies,  and
technology has been a significant contributing factor to creating an effective “labor glut.”  This glut can be
natural  (demographic or policy-driven increases in labor supply) or  “synthetic”  via automation (machines
augmenting or replacing labor , effectively expanding labor supply or reducing labor needs). Both have been
at play in recent decades.
Demographic and Global Labor Surplus
In the postwar decades, many developed countries actually experienced tight labor markets at times –
which empowered unions and led to strong wage growth. But starting around the 1980s, two things
occurred: - Demographic shifts : The Baby Boomers fully entered the workforce by the 1970s-80s, swelling
the labor supply. Women’s participation soared, as discussed, adding millions of workers by the 1990s
. This dramatic increase in labor supply (in the US and many Western countries) put downward pressure
on wages absent a commensurate increase in labor demand. In earlier times, strong industrial growth
absorbed these workers, but by the late 20th century, with manufacturing shrinking and service growth not
keeping pace in quality, the effect was more competition for jobs. Some economists argue that the large
influx of women into paid work, while a positive societal development, might have contributed to wage
stagnation because it eased labor shortages that might have forced employers to pay more. (Of course, it67
12
22
also increased overall household incomes since more people were working, but individual wages faced
pressure.)
Globalization’s Great Doubling : Perhaps even more consequential was the entry of China, India,
and ex-Soviet bloc  into the global capitalist economy by the 1990s. Harvard economist Richard
Freeman famously called this the “Great Doubling” of the world’s labor force . All of a sudden,
Western corporations had access to billions of additional workers – many of them eager to work at a
fraction of the wage of Western workers. This created a global labor glut in tradable sectors. The
immediate impact was offshoring of jobs (so Western workers lost jobs to equally capable but
cheaper labor abroad), and the longer-term impact was a threat effect: even jobs that stayed
domestic were under the shadow that they could  be offshored or the products imported. This
drastically weakened unions and workers’ leverage. For instance, in manufacturing and even some
service industries (like call centers, IT support), employers could credibly say, “If you demand higher
pay, we will move this operation to Asia or Eastern Europe.” Often they did move anyway. The result
was that workers lost bargaining power because their employer now had alternative labor
sources globally . This was a huge shift from the mid-20th century when, for example, an American
auto company’s alternative to Detroit labor was limited (they more or less had to produce in America
to sell in America). By the 2000s, that company could produce in Mexico or China and ship back, or
source parts globally – and they did. 
The combination of these factors meant that by the 2000s,  labor was relatively abundant on a global
scale . The effect on wages was observable: real wages for lower-skill jobs either stagnated or declined in
many rich countries, especially in sectors exposed to trade. A study of trade impact on U.S. manufacturing
(Autor , Dorn, Hanson 2013) found significant job losses and wage depression in regions exposed to Chinese
import competition – essentially showing labor in those areas faced an oversupply on a global stage and
lost out. 
Now, these natural  surpluses were not caused by automation per se, but they set the stage such that when
automation came in, workers were already on the back foot . There was not a tight labor market forcing
firms to share productivity gains; rather , there was slack or the ability to tap cheaper labor , so firms had
every incentive to keep cutting labor costs – either through outsourcing or investing in technology to
replace workers. Automation can be seen as part of the toolbox companies had to reduce reliance on
(expensive) domestic labor .
Automation as “Synthetic” Labor Supply
Automation effectively adds to the labor supply because each robot or software program is like a laborer (or
multiple laborers) added to the economy. For example, if one machine can do the work of 5 people, that’s
akin to injecting 5 units of labor supply (in terms of tasks done). When an AI can answer customer inquiries,
it  is  providing  labor  that  otherwise  a  human  would.  So  from  the  perspective  of  the  labor  market,
automation increases the available labor (only that “labor” is not human). This tends to reduce the demand
for human labor at prevailing wages  – in other words, it shifts the labor demand curve leftward, leading
to a lower wage equilibrium if all else equal.
We can see evidence of this in the declining labor share  and rising profit share we discussed. When labor is
weak, capital captures more of output as profit. Indeed, corporate profits reached record highs in many
countries in the 2010s-2020s, while labor’s share hit lows . In Australia, for example, workers’ share of
GDP hit an all-time low ~44% in 2022, while profits soared to nearly 30% of GDP . In the U.S., corporate• 
6463
20
20
23
profit margins hit multi-decade highs in the 2010s, and the stock market (representing capital owners)
boomed far above wage growth. This transfer of income from labor to capital  is exactly what one would
expect  when  labor  has  reduced  bargaining  power  and  can  be  substituted  by  machines  or  alternative
workers easily . The fact that real unit labor costs  have fallen in some places means output per worker
rose faster than wages, so more of the value is going to capital. Australia’s data noted a 4.9% drop in real
unit labor costs in 2022 , which the analysts pointed out as evidence that inflation wasn’t due to wages
(which were lagging) but profits – again indicating labor couldn’t demand pay rises even in a tight economy,
because other forces (likely profit-taking and productivity, possibly from tech) prevented it .
Union decline  is a strong indicator of bargaining power erosion. Unions historically counteract the labor
surplus effect by collective action. But technology has indirectly contributed to union decline by removing
heavily unionized jobs (e.g., automation in steel and auto manufacturing cut union membership drastically
as those sectors shed labor). Also, when technology creates new industries (like IT), they often start non-
unionized and have stayed that way, further eroding union density by sectoral shift. In the U.S., private-
sector unionization is now just 6% . The result is that individual workers largely negotiate alone, with far
less clout.  Companies can set wages with less pushback . They often cite technology or competition to
justify not raising pay: “We can’t increase your wage because our competitors have automated and cut
costs;  we  must  do  the  same  or  outsource.”  Whether  always  true  or  not,  it’s  a  potent  argument  that
resonates in an environment where people know jobs are easily rationalized.
An illustrative historical moment: in the 1980s, U.S. President Reagan fired striking air traffic controllers and
replaced them – partly using military controllers, but it sent a signal that even skilled workers could be
swapped out (not by tech in that case, but by alternative labor). This ushered in a tough era for unions.
Similarly, in the UK, Margaret Thatcher’s era broke union power in coal mining and other industries – one
could argue globalization (availability of imported coal) and nascent automation in mining meant those
workers had less leverage. Once those bastions fell, overall worker bargaining fell. Since then, wage growth
in the UK for median workers has often been sluggish, and in the US too.
Now consider the present AI era : Already we see companies like IBM using AI as a reason to not hire or to
slow hiring . That’s preemptive bargaining power effect – IBM essentially is saying, we don’t need to hire
because we have AI coming. If a prospective employee is negotiating salary or a raise, they know the
employer is considering AI as an alternative to adding headcount. This inherently weakens the worker’s
position. Similarly, if employees demand a lot, a firm could invest in more RPA or AI to automate them away.
This threat will only become more pronounced as technology improves. It may not result in overnight
layoffs, but during annual budget planning, many firms are likely asking: can we trim staff through tech? If
the answer is yes for some tasks, those roles lose security and wage bargaining room.
Another mechanism: Labor market slack  keeps wages down even if unemployment is low, if a lot of people
are out of the labor force wanting jobs. We touched on this with participation rates. For example, prime-age
male participation’s decline means a pool of potential workers that can be drawn in if wages tick up, which
can dampen wage pressure. Janet Yellen (former Fed Chair) in the 2010s often mentioned “hidden slack”
due to low participation. Part of why they thought inflation (and wage inflation) stayed low despite low
unemployment was exactly that – many who left might re-enter if conditions were right, so companies
didn’t need to raise wages much to attract talent; they could dip into that pool.
Artificial labor surplus  from automation can mimic that effect: if a company can increase output by adding
robots instead of people, then even a tight labor market doesn’t force their hand to raise wages; they have21
68
68
66
55
24
another option. In economic terms, technology can make the labor supply curve effectively more elastic – if
labor gets costly, firms substitute capital. This puts an upper bound on wage growth. Historically, this wasn’t
as immediately doable in many fields (there were limits to substitution), but with modern tech, substitution
is more feasible across a range of jobs.
Finally, we should note that  policy responses  can counteract or exacerbate these trends. For example,
stronger labor protections or active labor market policies in Europe mitigated some impacts (European
labor  share  also  fell  but  generally  less  than  U.S.).  But  many  countries  followed  more  laissez-faire
approaches  in  the  1980s-2000s,  which  combined  with  tech  and  globalization  to  shift  power  to  capital
significantly. 
One tangible indicator of capital’s power is the soaring wealth of shareholders and executives relative to
workers. CEO pay in the U.S. has shot up from roughly 20-30 times the average worker in 1970 to well over
300  times  today  –  partly  because  shareholders  and  boards  captured  gains  from  tech/productivity  for
themselves, not needing to share with workers. The stock market’s growth outpacing wage bills is another
sign. 
In  conclusion,  the  presence  of  a  labor  surplus  –  whether  visible  (unemployment)  or  invisible
(outsourcing  possibilities,  automation  potential)  –  means  capital  can  dictate  terms.  This  results  in
suppressed wage growth, precarious jobs, and a larger share of income going to profits and the highest
earners. The evidence is seen in the data on labor share , union density , wage inequality , and
corporate profits . All these trends align with a story that  labor has lost bargaining power over the
last several decades, and technology has been a prime factor in that shift . 
Workers  in  developed  economies  find  themselves  in  a  catch-22:  if  they  ask  for  more,  companies  can
automate or outsource; if they acquiesce, they stagnate. It’s a buyers’ market for labor in many industries
because  technology  and  globalization  expanded  the  effective  labor  pool  dramatically.  This  is  a  stark
challenge to the mid-20th century experience where labor was in shorter supply (in part due to less tech
and closed economies) and thus could win better terms.
Having thoroughly examined the multifaceted ways in which automation and technology have eroded labor
demand and wages – from macroeconomic trends to occupational shifts, superstar firms to bargaining
power – we will now conclude by synthesizing these findings and reflecting on the implications for the
future of work and economic equity in developed economies.
Conclusion
The evidence compiled in this report leads to a clear and challenging conclusion: In developed economies
from the late 20th century into the 21st, technology – especially automation – has often acted more
to erode labor demand and suppress wage growth than to enhance them, contrary to the reassuring
narratives of mainstream economics.7 66 65

This conclusion is not drawn lightly; it emerges from multiple converging trends, each documented with
rigorous data and research:
Macroeconomic trends since 1980  show a marked decoupling between productivity and median
wages , a declining labor share of income across many advanced countries , and (in the
U.S. case) a labor force participation retreating from historic highs . These are broad indicators
that something structural – beyond normal cyclical forces – has been at work, diminishing the extent
to which working people benefit from economic progress. Technology, by enabling huge productivity
gains without commensurate job gains, is at the heart of this structural shift.
Occupational and sectoral analysis  confirms that automation has directly eliminated vast swathes
of jobs: manufacturing employment has been devastated (falling from around 30% to under 10% of
jobs in economies like the U.S.) , routine office and administrative roles are disappearing by the
millions , and even newer white-collar roles are increasingly under threat from AI. While new jobs
have arisen, they have not appeared fast enough nor in sufficient quantity to replace those lost,
particularly for middle-skill workers . The result is polarization: growth in high-pay and low-pay
jobs, contraction in the middle – a recipe for inequality and social strain.
The  rise  of  superstar  firms  and  increased  market  concentration,  enabled  by  technology,  has
further broken the historical link between growing business revenues and growing employment.
Leading firms now achieve unprecedented scale with relatively few workers , contributing
to a declining aggregate demand for labor and a fall in labor’s share of output as these firms tend to
have low labor cost ratios . The superstar phenomenon underscores that technological efficiency
gains have translated into  higher profits, not higher wages or employment , when captured by firms
with market power .
Case studies of automation technologies  from robotics to RPA to AI reveal tangible examples of
workers being replaced or bypassed. Banks implementing RPA shed back-office jobs ; companies
adopting AI plan hiring freezes for roles that algorithms can perform . We see that whenever
technology reaches a threshold of capability, businesses are quick to substitute it for human labor –
an economically rational choice that nonetheless reduces opportunities for workers. Projections by
major analysts (e.g., 300 million jobs potentially impacted by AI globally ) and actions by companies
like IBM  indicate this substitution effect is poised to accelerate.
Job displacement vs. creation dynamics  have, in recent decades, tipped toward displacement. The
period from roughly 1980 onward has been characterized by an  acceleration of automation and a
weakening of new job creation . This is a reversal of earlier epochs where new industries
(manufacturing, services) rose to absorb those leaving older sectors. The empirical decomposition of
employment  changes  suggests  that  many  advanced  economies  now  struggle  to  find  labor-
absorbing innovations at the pace needed to keep workers fully employed in good jobs . We are
essentially running a race where machines are often outpacing the economy’s ability to invent new
uses for human labor .
Aggregate  indicators  like  low  unemployment  have  masked  underlying  issues  of
underemployment, stagnant incomes, and deteriorating job quality. While official jobless rates fell to
multi-decade lows by the late 2010s, this belied the reality that many of those jobs were part-time,
gig-based,  or  low-paying  with  few  benefits .  Nearly  all  net  job  growth  came  from  non-•

traditional work arrangements  in the U.S. over a decade . Similarly, low unemployment in, say,
the UK coexisted with zero real wage growth for a decade – a combination possible only when
worker  bargaining  power  is  feeble.  The  usual  mechanism  that  would  translate  labor  market
tightness  into  wage  gains  has  been  short-circuited,  and  the  widespread  ability  to  offshore  or
automate is a big part of the reason. 
Labor’s bargaining power has indeed eroded , as seen in declining unionization , historically low
strike activity, and the shift of national income toward profits . Technology has expanded the
effective supply of labor (through automation and global labor arbitrage), creating a buyer’s market
for labor that keeps workers in check. The outcomes – from minimal wage growth for the 90%  to
record  corporate  profit  shares  –  align  with  the  hypothesis  that  a  labor  surplus  (natural  or
artificial) benefits capital at labor’s expense. In short, the balance of power in the workplace has
tilted heavily toward employers , who can more credibly say to employees: “Take it or leave it; you
are replaceable by a machine or a cheaper worker elsewhere.”
Having assembled this evidence, we can directly answer the question: Has technology been eroding labor
demand and suppressing wages in developed economies? The answer , supported by the data and research
cited throughout, is yes – and to a significant degree . This does not mean technology has been the only
force (policy, globalization, and other factors intertwine), nor that technology hasn’t delivered immense
benefits in terms of new products, efficiencies, and consumer surplus. But those benefits have not been
broadly shared in the form of labor market outcomes. Instead, we have seen a paradox of plenty: more
technological capability than ever , but median workers often struggling to gain ground.
This  poses  a  challenge  to  the  mainstream  economic  orthodoxy .  The  traditional  view  assumes  various
equilibrating mechanisms will ensure technology ultimately raises all boats: lower prices create demand
elsewhere, new industries emerge, displaced workers retrain, etc. These mechanisms do operate to some
extent, but the last several decades suggest they are weaker or slower than before, and that without
intervention, the market outcome can be prolonged stagnation or decline for many workers. In other
words, the Luddite concerns that were historically proven wrong in the long run may be coming true
in a more lasting way in the modern era . As MIT’s Autor quipped, “This time may be different” – not in the
sense that all jobs will disappear , but that the labor market may not naturally self-correct to a high-wage,
full-employment equilibrium if we continue on the current technological trajectory . Especially with
AI capable of encroaching on skilled cognitive work, the old assumption that humans will always  have the
comparative advantage in something may need to be revisited. 
The findings here also underscore that headline metrics are insufficient gauges of economic health . We
must pay attention to who is benefiting. If GDP grows but labor’s slice shrinks, if unemployment is low but
wages are flat, if profits soar but middle-class jobs erode – those are signs of a deep imbalance. They
suggest an economy where technology’s fruits are captured by a narrow slice (capital owners, top talent)
while the general workforce treads water or loses ground. Such an economy, if left unchecked, can lead to
social and political strains – from populist backlashes against trade and tech, to generational malaise
(young people feeling they can’t match their parents’ living standards), to declining trust in institutions that
promised broad prosperity from innovation.
It  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  report  to  prescribe  policy,  but  the  evidence  certainly  implies  that  new
approaches are needed  to ensure technology benefits labor broadly. These could range from education
and training reforms (to better equip workers for complementing tech) to stronger labor protections and4

collective bargaining (to give workers more say and share in productivity gains), to perhaps even rethinking
incentives for the types of innovations that are pursued (promoting “labor-augmenting” innovations versus
purely labor-replacing automation ). Without such measures, the trajectory described in this report
may continue or worsen: a future of plenty in aggregate but scarcity in the wage packet of the average
person – essentially, “immiserating growth”  for the working class in advanced societies.
In conclusion, the hypothesis that technology and automation have eroded labor demand and suppressed
wages in developed economies is strongly supported by the weight of empirical evidence from the past
half-century. This runs contrary to the comforting narrative that technological progress automatically lifts all
workers. Instead, we find that market forces alone have not guaranteed positive outcomes for labor in
the face of rapid technological change . Recognizing this reality is the first step towards addressing it. The
goal should be to harness technology in a way that  renews  broad-based prosperity – learning from the
postwar decades when productivity and wages rose in tandem – rather than accepting a future where the
benefits of machines accrue only to those who own them or have the rare skills to work alongside them at
the top. 
The stakes are high. As technology, especially AI, gallops ahead, societies that proactively adapt can enjoy
its fruits widely; those that do not may see further polarization and discontent. The findings of this report
urge economists, policymakers, and business leaders to  re-evaluate long-held assumptions  and craft
strategies that ensure the next chapter of technological advancement is one where labor is not a casualty
but a partner in progress.
Footnotes:  (See below for referenced sources supporting the data and claims made in this report.)
 BLS analysis of labor force participation trends (1950–1998) – showing the rise from 60.4% in 1950
to 66.4% by 1990, largely due to increased female participation.
 USAFacts/BLS data on U.S. labor force participation – peaked at 67.3% in early 2000, declining to
~62% by 2025; also notes women’s participation rising from 32% (1948) to ~60% (2000) and men’s falling
from 86.7% to 67.6%.
 Karabarbounis & Neiman (2014) – documentation of the significant decline in the global labor share of
income since the early 1980s across most countries/industries, attributing about half of the decline to
cheaper technology (lower price of capital inducing labor substitution).
 OECD Working Paper (Schwellnus et al. 2018) – notes that over the past two decades, median wage
growth decoupled from productivity growth in many OECD countries, partly due to declining labor income
shares.
 Australia Institute (Jericho & Richardson 2022) – reports Australia’s employee compensation at only
44.1% of GDP (record low) and corporate profits at 29.9% (record high) in 2022, indicating labor share at
historic low while profit share surges, consistent with global trends.
 Autor  et  al.  (2017/2020)  –  “Rise  of  Superstar  Firms”  abstract,  listing  predictions:  rising  sales
concentration in industries, largest concentration increases see biggest labor share declines, output shifts
to high-productivity low-labor firms, etc., all supported by data.
 Autor et al. continued – notes superstar firms have high markups and low labor share; as output
reallocates to them, aggregate labor share falls (empirically confirmed in U.S. and international data).
 Martin Ford talk slide via Gris Anik blog – GM in 1979 (840k workers) vs Google in 2012 (38k
workers) with Google having 20% more inflation-adjusted earnings; highlights Google’s profits benefiting
far fewer people (GM supported ~2.5 million people vs Google ~114k when considering dependents).
 Cleveland Fed (2025) – study showing 1980–2015 clerical job share fell 6.5 pp in high-ICT-adopting cities23

vs 2.3 pp in others; clerical employment share gap between NYC and rural areas closed by 2005 as big cities
lost more clerical jobs . Reflects ICT-driven elimination of many back-office roles.
 Conference Board (2022) – notes 2+ million office/admin support jobs lost 2016–2021, with financial
clerks down 10.3% and secretaries down 8.7% in recent years, attributing decline to automation of tasks like
calendar management and bookkeeping .
 Coalition for Prosperous America (Ferry & McConkey 2023) – reports U.S. manufacturing employment at
8.3% of workforce, all-time low, versus ~30% in 1950s-60s; underscores the long-run collapse of factory jobs
despite output growth.
 EPI, “Wage Stagnation in Nine Charts” – states from 1973 to 2013 productivity +74% vs typical worker
hourly compensation +9%, encapsulating the productivity-pay gap growth.
 Acemoglu & Restrepo (JEP 2019) – explain that automation displaces labor (reducing labor share
and  possibly  labor  demand)  while  new  tasks  reinstate  labor  (increasing  labor  share/demand);  their
empirical  work  finds  that  since  the  1980s,  displacement  accelerated  and  new  task  creation  slowed,
accounting for slower employment growth in last 30 years.
 MIT News (2024) on Autor’s study – finds since 1980, technology has replaced  more jobs than it created
in the U.S., due to faster automation and slower augmentation in last 40 years compared to prior decades.
This is based on new research analyzing census job data and patents .
 Quartz (Kopf 2016) summary of Katz & Krueger – “94% of net job growth from 2005–2015 was in
alternative  work  (temp,  independent  contractor ,  gig,  etc.),  with  over  60%  from  rise  of  independent
contractors/freelancers” (i.e., very few traditional employment jobs added) .
 EPI data – between 1979 and 2013, real wages of bottom 90% grew ~15% while top 1% grew 138%,
highlighting inequality and that typical workers saw negligible gains over decades .
 Wikipedia (citing BLS) – U.S. union membership 20.1% in 1983 down to 10.1% in 2022; private sector
only 6.0% in 2022. Shows erosion of collective bargaining presence.
 Reuters (2023) – IBM CEO expects to pause hiring for back-office roles and sees 30% of such roles
(~7,800 jobs) replaceable by AI in 5 years, with hiring suspended in those areas. Illustrates corporate
planning to reduce workforce via AI.
 Goldman Sachs analysis via GS or CNBC – generative AI could expose 300 million full-time jobs globally
to  automation;  in  U.S./Euro,  up  to  1/4  of  work  tasks  could  be  automated.  Suggests  large  potential
displacement (though also productivity gains).
 Money.com (Citibank report story, 2016) – Citibank analysts predicted ~30% of bank jobs could be cut
by 2025 due to automation (“Banking’s Uber Moment”). Implies hundreds of thousands of finance jobs at
risk in one decade .
 Pew Research (2014) “AI, Robotics, Future of Jobs” – key theme from canvassed experts: historically,
technology has been a net creator of jobs (this is the optimistic consensus among many experts, provided
as context to then discuss concerns) . This viewpoint is challenged by our findings, but it’s cited to
contrast expert expectations with outcomes.
 Karabarbounis & Neiman – they point out the role of cheaper IT capital in driving shift from labor to
capital; specifically, that decline in price of investment goods explains about half the labor share decline
even accounting for other factors. This supports the argument that tech (making capital cheap/effective)
directly led firms to use less labor .
