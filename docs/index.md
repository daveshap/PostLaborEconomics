# Post-Labor Economics Research

Welcome to the GitHub Pages site for the Post-Labor Economics project.

Converted versions of the PDFs in the `/Research` directory will appear here as
HTML pages. If you add or update PDFs, run one of the conversion scripts in the
`Research` folder to regenerate the files for the site:

```
python convert_pdfs_to_html.py   # preserves layout using pdfminer.six
# or
python convert_pdfs_to_md.py     # simple text-only Markdown output
```
