Degrowth and Post-Labor Economics: A Blueprint for Sustainable Growth First Principles of Degrowth Degrowth is an economic paradigm rooted in ecological realism. It begins from the empirical fact that industrial civilization is overshooting planetary boundaries – the biophysical limits within which humanity can safely operate. Earth system scientists warn that six of nine critical planetary boundaries (including climate change, biodiversity loss, biogeochemical flows, and others) have already been transgressed . In practical terms, this means the global economy’s scale of resource extraction and waste emissions is incompatible with a stable Earth system. Degrowth proponents argue that indefinite GDP growth in wealthy economies is biophysically impossible to sustain without breaching these ecological ceilings. The planetary boundary framework underlines how crossing one limit (say, excessive carbon emissions) destabilizes others (like ocean chemistry or biosphere integrity), demanding a holistic downsizing of economic throughput to remain within a “safe operating space” for humanity. Thermodynamic and material constraints are central to degrowth’s first principles. The economy is conceived as a subsystem of the Earth, bound by the laws of thermodynamics and reliant on material and energy throughput. In contrast to the neoclassical view of the economy as an abstract, closed system of exchange, degrowth economics emphasizes that all production is ultimately a dissipative process – transforming high-quality energy and materials into goods, and eventually into waste heat and pollution in accordance with the entropy law (Georgescu-Roegen’s insight). Ecological economists stress that there are hard biophysical limits to how efficiently resources can be used and recycled; perpetual growth in material throughput is constrained by these thermodynamic realities . The concept of energy return on investment (EROI) illustrates this: as high-grade energy sources deplete, more energy is expended to harness remaining resources, diminishing net yields and imposing an eventual economic contraction. Degrowth thinking therefore calls for a planned down-scaling of energy and material use, aligning economic activity with what can be sustainably supplied by renewable flows and the Earth’s assimilative capacities . Degrowth also arises from recognition of the structural failures of current economic systems . One such failure is the incentive structure driving firms, investors, and governments to pursue growth at any cost. The global economy today is structurally “wired” for endless expansion – firms seek ever-higher profits, nations compete for ever-higher GDP – regardless of whether additional production actually improves well- being . This growth imperative is buttressed by institutions (financial markets, debt-money systems, political incentives) that reward short-term output and externalize long-term damage. Degrowth theorists point out that this results in perverse outcomes: unpriced externalities and systemic market failures that degrade the commons. For example, environmental costs like carbon emissions, deforestation, or toxic waste are typically not reflected in market prices – they are economic “externalities” borne by society and future generations. As a result, the profit motive drives over-production of “bads” (pollution, resource depletion) that are not penalized financially. Indeed, a key motivation for degrowth is that contemporary markets fail to internalize ecological costs: much environmental harm “tends to not get priced” at all under1 2 3 4 5 1 business-as-usual . The atmosphere, oceans, and biosphere are treated as free dumping grounds, so the private returns from plundering them remain artificially high while the true costs are offloaded to society in the form of climate change and biodiversity loss. Relatedly, degrowth highlights rebound effects and other counterproductive feedbacks in the current system. Efficiency improvements alone, while necessary, are not sufficient if the system’s incentives remain geared toward expansion. The rebound effect (or Jevons’ Paradox) observes that gains in resource efficiency often lower the effective cost of using a resource, which can induce higher total consumption of that resource (partially or completely offsetting the efficiency gains). For instance, more efficient vehicles may lead to longer driving distances; more efficient industrial processes can lower prices and spur greater demand. Thus, without structural change, technological advances that increase efficiency risk simply accelerating throughput elsewhere in the economy – a phenomenon repeatedly documented in energy and resource use . Degrowth theory sees this as confirmation that absolute decoupling of GDP from resource use is deeply challenging: while relative efficiency can improve, total resource use and emissions often keep rising when the economy grows, due to these rebound dynamics and the pursuit of new markets. This is why degrowth proponents advocate for scaling down production and consumption in affluent economies outright, rather than hoping that green tech and efficiency alone will allow endless growth without ecological consequence . Finally, degrowth critiques the failures of value accounting and incentives in capitalism. GDP growth is pursued as a policy end in itself, yet GDP is blind to whether increased spending contributes to welfare or merely costs (e.g. oil spills and natural disasters can increase GDP via clean-up efforts). Moreover , crucial aspects of human well-being – clean air and water , climate stability, community cohesion, care work – are treated as external to market calculations and thus underprovided or eroded. The incentive structures of firms reward rent-seeking and cost externalization: it is often more profitable to lobby against environmental regulation, or to shift costs onto workers or ecosystems, than to genuinely innovate in resource-saving. The current system’s price signals also undervalue future generations; short-term returns are prioritized, discounting long-term ecological resilience. Degrowth economics calls for correcting these structural flaws by adopting new indicators of progress (e.g. well-being indices, ecological footprint), internalizing externalities (through carbon taxes, caps, or strict limits), and redesigning institutions so that social and ecological objectives guide economic activity, rather than profit maximization for a few. In sum, the first principles of degrowth demand a fundamental reorientation: from quantity to quality , from growth to equilibrium, and from private gain to the public good, in order to bring the human enterprise back within Earth’s carrying capacity . First Principles of Post-Labor Economics (PLE) Post-Labor Economics (PLE) is a forward-looking paradigm that envisions an economic system no longer centered on human labor as the primary engine of production and distribution. It takes as its premise the rapid advancement of automation, artificial intelligence, and robotics that are making human workers increasingly superfluous in many industries. PLE asks: What happens when machines can perform most productive tasks better, faster, and cheaper than humans ? How should society reorganize itself when a livelihood need not be earned through wage labor? In addressing these questions, PLE articulates several salient first principles or pillars that define its vision for a sustainable, equitable post-labor economy: Subsidiarity and Decentralization : Push decisions to the lowest effective level. PLE holds that economic and political decisions should be made as locally as possible, by the communities directly6 7 3 56 • 2 affected. This principle of subsidiarity means empowering municipalities, cooperatives, and smaller- scale units to govern their own economic affairs unless there is a compelling reason to scale a decision upward . The rationale is that local stakeholders have the best information about local needs and are most invested in sustainable outcomes for their region. Decentralization in the PLE context also involves leveraging advanced technologies (like blockchain and AI) to enable distributed governance. For example, one proposal is for AGI-powered decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to manage local services (schools, utilities, city planning) more responsively and transparently than remote bureaucracies . By keeping economic power dispersed, PLE aims to avoid the concentration of wealth and decision-making that characterizes late-stage capitalism. “Power naturally concentrates unless actively prevented ,” so systems must be designed to continuously redistribute authority and prevent any entity from “escaping market forces or shaping its own rules” . In essence, PLE envisions a network of human-scale economies coordinated via technology but retaining local autonomy and diversity. Circularity and Resource Regeneration : PLE endorses the principles of the circular economy , seeking to eliminate waste and drastically reduce new resource extraction by keeping materials in closed loops. While automation could increase production efficiency, PLE emphasizes that this must go hand-in-hand with circularity – designing products for durability, repair , reuse, and recycling, and creating feedback loops that treat all outputs as inputs for something else. This pillar is about optimizing resource use within sustainable bounds rather than pursuing throughput growth. Crucially, PLE’s circularity is envisioned to be locally implemented : communities should develop circular systems at the municipal or regional level, such as local zero-waste manufacturing, community repair workshops, and circular supply chains for key materials . By re-localizing production and recycling, transport emissions and long supply chains can be minimized. Moreover , circularity dovetails with subsidiarity: a locality that controls its own production and waste management has the incentive to maintain environmental quality for its residents. In PLE, automation and AI would be applied to improve sorting, remanufacturing and materials science for circular design, allowing high-tech “zero waste” production cycles . The synergy of circular economy practices with degrowth-style sufficiency is explicit – as one PLE blueprint notes, “ UBS (universal basic services) [are] best organized and operated locally ” and “circular economics [should be] implemented at municipal level” to foster regional self-sufficiency and sustainability . Ultimately, this pillar reflects an ethic of regeneration rather than extraction: the economy should operate like an ecosystem, where outputs (even at high-tech levels) are recycled or composted rather than accumulating as pollution or landfills. Automation-Driven Abundance : At the heart of PLE is the promise of automation-driven abundance – the idea that advanced robotics, AI, and labor-saving technologies can vastly increase productive capacity while freeing humans from drudgery. PLE embraces the Schumpeterian possibility that we are entering a post-scarcity era for many goods and services, where the marginal cost of production (especially of informational or digital goods) falls near zero. The principle here is to prioritize the automation of any labor that humans perform out of necessity rather than choice . Routine and dangerous jobs being taken over by machines is seen not as a threat but as an opportunity: a sign of technological progress enabling society to meet everyone’s needs with minimal human toil. PLE envisions fully automated farms, factories, and services that can produce essentials – food, shelter , basic products – in great abundance and with far less resource input, thanks to superior efficiency. This abundance is not meant to fuel mindless consumption, but rather to ensure sufficiency : everyone has access to a comfortable standard of living (nutrition, housing,8 9 1011 • 1213 13 • 14 3 healthcare, education, energy) without requiring perpetual economic expansion. In an automation- rich future, scarcity of basic goods might be virtually eliminated; indeed, some PLE proponents speak of the coming “ Great Decoupling ” of human labor from economic value creation . By this they mean that for the first time in history, rising productivity will no longer translate into more work or more goods per capita, but instead could allow the same output with less work (or massively more output with the same work, if we so chose). Harnessed correctly, automation can thus provide prosperity without growth : using advanced technology to maintain or raise living standards while actually reducing the throughput of energy and materials (through smart efficiency and circular practices). PLE’s blueprint is to treat involuntary human labor as a systems failure , to be systematically eliminated via innovation – much as past societies treated diseases as evils to be eradicated. This pillar underpins the optimistic thrust of PLE: a future of material abundance is achievable, where poverty is abolished, not by frantic GDP growth, but by deliberate technological empowerment and sharing of the productivity gains. Localized Production and Self-Sufficiency : If today’s globalization optimized for cost and scale, the PLE paradigm leans towards localized, distributed production optimized for resilience and community benefit. One of its tenets is that economic activity should, wherever feasible, be owned and operated by those directly involved and affected – local ownership maximizes efficiency in the sense of aligning production with local needs and values . This translates into a push for regional manufacturing hubs , 3D printing networks, urban vertical farms, community energy microgrids, and other means of local self-reliance. By shortening supply chains and producing closer to the point of use, PLE aims to reduce transportation impacts and avoid the massive externalities of global trade (which currently often shifts pollution to countries with lax regulations). Minimizing intermediaries is a related principle: every layer of middlemen between producers and consumers is seen as a site of rent extraction and inefficiency . Cutting out unnecessary intermediaries – whether via blockchain smart contracts that connect creators and users directly, or through platform cooperatives that replace extractive corporate platforms – can improve equity and reduce waste. PLE thus incorporates a vision of “ distributed manufacturing ” where, for example, a town might locally fabricate many of its goods (using open-source designs and automated machines), recycle local scrap into new products, and thereby close loops. Subsidiarity supports this: localities would take charge of production of staples to the extent possible, trading only what is necessary. By relocalizing production, PLE hopes to rebuild community economic sovereignty, reduce vulnerabilities to global supply shocks, and enable tailored solutions (e.g. designing products suited to local environments, using local materials). This pillar aligns strongly with degrowth’s emphasis on deglobalization of the economy and re-rooting in place-based systems that are easier to regulate democratically and to maintain within ecological limits. Incentive Realignment and Radical Transparency : A core pillar of PLE is realigning economic incentives so that individual, corporate, and political actions lead to socially and ecologically desirable outcomes by design, not by exception. “Align incentives with outcomes” is a mantra in PLE frameworks – those making economic decisions must directly feel the consequences (positive or negative) of those decisions . In practice, this implies fundamental reforms: for instance, ending the socialization of private risk , so that corporations cannot offload environmental or financial risks onto the public (through bailouts or pollution externalities) . It means redefining fiduciary duty and corporate purpose such that maximizing shareholder profit is subordinate to maximizing stakeholder well-being (including workers, communities, and the environment) . Concretely, PLE advocates policies like stringent pollution liabilities (polluter pays), removal of subsidies for harmful15 14 • 10 10 • 16 17 18 4 activities, and perhaps more radically, new forms of governance (e.g. DAOs or public utility models for key services) that bake in accountability. Radical transparency by default is another proposed pillar: significant economic actors (especially large firms and public institutions) must operate with open data and disclosures commensurate with their impact . This would be enabled by technologies like blockchain ledgers and real-time auditing AI, providing public visibility into supply chains, resource flows, algorithmic decisions, and more. The idea is that information asymmetry is a market failure – when consumers, workers, or citizens cannot see what companies are doing (e.g. hidden pollution, opaque AI algorithms, undisclosed risks), it enables exploitation and misallocation. PLE therefore envisions a future where economic information is a public good : every significant transaction or algorithmic decision could be logged transparently (while preserving individual privacy) to allow collective oversight. In such a regime, it becomes far harder for corporations to hide negative externalities or for elites to extract rents unseen. Decentralized ledger technology is seen as a tool to achieve this integrity: for example, smart contracts could enforce environmental standards by automatically charging fees if pollution sensors detect violations. Transparency and incentive alignment together create what we might call a “ moral market ” – a market whose rules and feedback loops inherently discourage harmful behavior and reward contributions to community and sustainability. PLE’s theorists argue that by redesigning these incentive structures (much as one would redesign a game’s rules to ensure fair play), a post- labor economy can avoid the traps of the current system and channel automation’s benefits toward the common good . Decoupling Livelihood from Wage Labor : Perhaps the defining normative pillar of PLE is the commitment to separating citizens’ basic livelihood and economic agency from the necessity of having a formal job . In a world where technology can produce plenty with minimal human labor , it becomes both possible and necessary to break the age-old link between “earning a living” and having a job or boss. This is not just a technocratic tweak – it is a civilizational shift in how we conceive of income, work, and purpose. PLE advocates a variety of mechanisms to ensure that people have access to income and resources independent of employment : these include proposals like Universal Basic Income (UBI) schemes, universal basic services , or social dividends from publicly owned assets. The GitHub repository that serves as the canon for PLE contains studies on Capital Endowment programs (direct asset grants to individuals at maturity), on community wealth funds, and on UBI pilots, all exploring how to provide material security in a job- sparse future. The underlying principle is that as automation displaces human labor , the fruits of that automation (the productivity gains) must be broadly shared, rather than accruing solely to owners of capital. This could mean, for instance, that each citizen becomes a shareholder of the national “automation dividend” and receives regular dividends as machines do more work . It could also mean robust public provisioning: free healthcare, education, housing guarantees, and so on, reducing the amount of money one needs to personally earn. PLE does not prescribe a single method, but insists on the outcome: no one should be left without livelihood just because society needs fewer workers . Decoupling livelihood from work also frees individuals to engage in forms of work that are unpaid or intrinsically motivated (art, caregiving, learning, civic participation) without risking destitution. It unlocks what one might call “post-work” culture, where identity and social value are no longer yoked to one’s job productivity. In the interim, PLE thinkers often support transitional policies like worktime reduction (e.g. a 4-day week, then 3-day week) to gradually share the diminishing volume of necessary work and give people time to adjust . Ultimately, the post- labor vision is that human well-being and social inclusion no longer depend on having a ‘job’ – a profound shift echoing philosopher André Gorz’s call for a society where work is not central to life or819 20 21 • 2223 24 5 rights. By institutionalizing economic security as a right , PLE lays the groundwork for an economy that can embrace degrowth (in terms of reduced labor and throughput) without incurring social collapse. This pillar is the social contract of a post-work world: humans are entitled to livelihood by virtue of citizenship (or existence), not by selling their labor . In summary, the first principles of Post-Labor Economics revolve around harnessing advanced technology to create a prosperous, equitable society that does not depend on perpetual growth or full employment . It is a paradigm of automation with human-centric goals : subsidiarity keeps power in check; circularity and local production keep the economy sustainable and resilient; automation and abundance free us from menial toil; incentive realignment and transparency civilize the market; and decoupling income from jobs ensures everyone benefits from these transformations. PLE’s guiding ethos might be described as “distributed abundance” : widely shared prosperity produced by decentralized, automated systems operating within ecological boundaries. It attempts to realign the economy’s purpose from serving capital to serving humanity, at a time when technology makes such a realignment not only possible but necessary. Comprehensive Synthesis of Degrowth and PLE Despite originating from different concerns – degrowth from ecological limits, and PLE from technological disruption – these two paradigms exhibit a deep alignment and can be seen as mutually reinforcing frameworks for a sustainable post-growth, post-work economy . A systematic comparison of their core tenets reveals substantial synergy in goals and in proposed structural changes. Here, we explore how the principles of PLE and degrowth complement each other , potentially converging into a coherent model of sustainable prosperity without GDP expansion . Rejection of GDP as the primary objective: Both degrowth and PLE categorically question the primacy of GDP growth as a measure of success. Degrowth advocates explicitly call for abandoning GDP growth as a goal in wealthy nations in favor of human well-being and ecological stability . PLE, for its part, is premised on the idea that we can massively increase real wealth (in terms of goods, services, free time, etc.) without corresponding increases in monetary transactions or employment – thus it too delinks the idea of “progress” from the GDP metric. In fact, one of PLE’s success criteria is “Increasing Citizen Economic Agency” rather than increasing output . A PLE system could theoretically achieve high levels of public prosperity even if conventional GDP stabilizes or declines, because automation would reduce costs and many essentials might be provided nearly free. Degrowth researchers have argued that human flourishing does not require ever-rising incomes – e.g., Hickel et al (2022) note that many high human-development outcomes can be met at a fraction of current rich-country per capita GDP, given the right social policies . PLE’s focus on decoupling livelihood from production directly operationalizes this: if people’s well-being is secured by universal dividends or services, then economic success is measured by outcomes (health, happiness, environmental quality) rather than the volume of market throughput. In short, both paradigms seek to redefine progress in terms beyond GDP – degrowth via sufficiency and well-being metrics, PLE via empowerment and distribution metrics. Sufficiency, not surplus: meeting human needs within limits: A key point of convergence is the idea of an economy geared toward sufficiency (everyone having “enough”) rather than ever-increasing luxury consumption. Degrowth emphasizes scaling down “destructive and unnecessary forms of production” while securing human needs and well-being . It prioritizes public goods, sharing, and simpler lifestyles over the consumerist treadmill. PLE, on the other hand, offers a technological path to sufficiency: using2526 27 5 28 6 automation to produce ample basic goods at low cost and with minimal labor . These visions dovetail. Imagine a society that has deliberately reduced its material throughput by halting the production of wasteful, status-oriented goods (SUVs, throwaway fast fashion, etc.), as degrowth recommends , while simultaneously deploying AI and robotics to efficiently provide affordable housing, public transit, renewable energy, and healthy food for all . The result would be a high standard of living achieved with far fewer resources than our current growth-driven system. Researchers have in fact noted this complementarity: “rather than chasing infinite growth, an automated future could deliberately scale down production in wealthy societies to reduce environmental impact, focusing on well-being over GDP ” . Automation’s productivity gains would be used not to inundate the world with more disposable commodities, but to ensure comfortable living standards for everyone within planetary boundaries . This essentially describes a post-growth economy of “prosperous degrowth” , where technology enables radical improvements in efficiency and distribution so that even a smaller-scale economy can deliver high quality of life. Notably, the concept of “doughnut economics” by Kate Raworth – living in a space that meets all basic needs without overshooting ecological limits – could be greatly aided by PLE technologies . Automation makes it easier to provide the “social foundation” (housing, food, healthcare, etc.) for all, while degrowth ensures we respect the ecological ceiling – together they fulfill both criteria of the doughnut model. Decoupling labor and livelihoods breaks the growth-employment trap: Perhaps the most powerful synergy lies in how PLE can resolve the structural conundrum that often haunts degrowth proposals: the threat of unemployment and social instability if we deliberately slow economic activity. Under the current system, jobs are tied to growth – when growth falters, companies lay off workers and livelihoods are lost, creating a political and humanitarian crisis. This dynamic forces even environmentally conscious societies to chase growth, because without growth, people lose incomes (“ scarcity creates recruits to the ideology of growth ” as Hickel observes ). Degrowth has long acknowledged this and thus calls for measures like work-time reduction and job guarantees to manage the contraction. Here, PLE provides a decisive solution: ensure livelihoods are guaranteed independent of jobs . By implementing robust basic incomes or services (as PLE advocates), people would no longer be entirely dependent on labor market participation for survival. This would liberate society from the need to perpetually “create jobs” via any means (even environmentally destructive means) just to avoid mass unemployment . In a sense, PLE’s social safety nets and dividends neutralize the social instability problem of degrowth . If an economy decides to scale down ecologically harmful industries (say, reducing automobile production or closing coal mines), it can do so without throwing workers into destitution , because incomes are delinked from those jobs. The workers affected would continue to receive livelihood support, possibly retraining for greener roles or simply not needing to work as much. The often-cited degrowth policy of a shorter workweek is in fact a bridge to PLE’s scenario: by gradually shortening the workweek, we spread the remaining necessary work among more people and free up time – anticipating a future where machines handle most tasks and human work is optional or part-time. We see experimental convergence already: proposals for a 4-day workweek, heavy investment in public sector jobs (like care, education, environmental restoration) that PLE also values, and basic income trials have all been floated as part of a “post-growth deal” to maintain social cohesion . PLE fully embraces these: it directly calls for automating away “labor performed from necessity” and compensating people through new mechanisms. In sum, PLE operationalizes the degrowth transition by providing an answer to the question “what about jobs?” – it says we don’t need traditional jobs for livelihoods at all, if wealth and tech are properly managed. This transforms degrowth from a potentially recessionary prospect to a utopian prospect: the economy can power down harmful excess production while everyone still thrives , because incomes and meaning are derived from outside the narrow wage labor relationship.26 4 29 30 31 31 2432 14 7 Shared emphasis on equity and new ownership models: Both frameworks insist that without tackling inequality and ownership, neither ecological sustainability nor technological utopia is attainable. Degrowth is inherently a call for redistribution and global justice – it argues that rich countries must consume less so that poor regions can have enough, and within societies it advocates reducing inequality (through limits on extreme incomes/wealth, expanded commons, etc.) . PLE likewise acknowledges that simply automating production under current ownership (where capital assets are concentrated) could lead to dystopian inequality – a “neo-feudal” scenario of a tiny elite owning all the robots and the masses with no income . Therefore, PLE proposals often include shared or public ownership of the automation infrastructure , to spread the benefits. For instance, one idea is that AI and robot dividends become a public trust: “publicly owned automation yields a universal basic dividend” , effectively treating advanced AI/ robotics as a commons . This aligns with degrowth’s push to expand the commons and decommodify basic services . Both paradigms thus converge on post-capitalist ownership structures : whether it’s cooperatives, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), municipal enterprises, or state ownership of essential systems, the goal is to prevent wealth from automation from pooling only at the top. The PLE literature’s exploration of “Participatory Ownership Models” and community wealth funds resonates with degrowth calls for economic democracy. Concretely, one could imagine a policy program embraced by both: e.g. universal basic services (UBS) to guarantee healthcare, education, transport, housing, etc. (a degrowth favored policy to reduce private consumption needs) funded by returns on automation (a PLE mechanism) – perhaps through a sovereign robot fund or taxing AI productivity. This way, automation’s gains directly finance the commons that let people live well with less private consumption. Such schemes create a virtuous cycle of equity and sustainability: with strong public services and income floor , there’s less socio- political resistance to shutting down harmful industries (since workers and consumers are protected), which furthers degrowth goals. Moreover , both PLE and degrowth envision new forms of investment and innovation driven by public purpose rather than profit. For example, PLE’s advocacy of mission-driven DAOs or state investment in “decentralization infrastructure” parallels degrowth’s call for directed innovation (e.g. renewable energy transition, conservation tech, care economy innovations) not beholden to market return but to social value. Reinforcing feedback between technological efficiency and reduction of throughput: Degrowth often emphasizes that merely improving efficiency (eco-efficiency of production, energy efficiency, etc.) will not automatically reduce overall impact – in fact it may accelerate growth unless accompanied by sufficiency- oriented policies. PLE, however , adds a crucial element: if the macro-structure of incentives is changed (as described above) and livelihood security is assured, then efficiency gains from advanced technology can actually be harnessed to reduce throughput rather than fuel more growth. For instance, consider the role of AI in optimizing energy use. Under business-as-usual, more efficient AI-driven logistics might just lower costs and lead to more shipping of goods (rebound). But in a PLE+degrowth scenario where there is no pressure to maximize output and carbon is strictly capped or taxed, that same AI efficiency translates to absolute energy savings – allowing society to live well on a fraction of current energy. The two paradigms together create conditions for “absolute decoupling” of well-being from resource use, which neither could fully guarantee alone. PLE contributes the high-tech tools for decoupling (renewables, AI optimization, precision agriculture, etc.), degrowth contributes the systemic commitment to cap and reduce total resource use. Indeed, a review of post-labor scenarios notes that these ideas “ dovetail ” – using automation to provide a comfortable living for all within planetary boundaries implies that advanced technology is deployed not to chase infinite output but to assist a contraction of throughput with minimal social pain . This is essentially the Holy Grail of sustainable development: increasing human welfare while shrinking ecological footprints. By combining PLE and degrowth, the economy could achieve something like “efficiency inversion” – all productivity improvements are translated into less extraction and work, rather33 34 23 35 36 4 8 than more consumption. For example, if robotic automation doubles productivity in manufacturing, instead of doubling production, society could choose to produce the same amount with half the resources (and let people work half as long). Such choices require the value-system shift of degrowth and the technological capability of PLE. Focus on localization and resilience: Both frameworks are skeptical of the fragile, globe-spanning just-in- time supply chains of neoliberal globalization. Degrowth often promotes local food systems, local crafts and repair , and regional trade circuits as more resilient and less carbon-intensive. PLE similarly advocates localized production powered by automation (micro-factories, 3D printing labs, vertical farms). This means a PLE world would likely see a reversal of some aspects of globalization: production becoming more distributed geographically, supply chains shortening, and communities gaining relative self-reliance in essentials. This alignment is mutually reinforcing: localization reduces transport emissions and empowers communities (degrowth goals), while automation ensures that localization doesn’t mean regress or inefficiency – small local facilities can be as productive as large centralized factories when endowed with advanced tech (PLE goal). For instance, degrowth’s vision of cities with urban agriculture and repair cafés can be turbocharged by PLE’s autonomous hydroponic farms and AI-driven recycling fabs. Additionally, both stress community resilience : degrowth via social capital and simpler living, PLE via smart systems that can run autonomously (e.g., microgrids that keep the lights on even if the central grid fails, thanks to AI balancing of local renewable energy). As a result, a synthesis of the two would create communities that are both low-impact and highly robust to shocks. We saw during the COVID-19 pandemic that global just-in-time systems are brittle; a PLE/degrowth approach would have, for example, more local PPE production and more emphasis on sufficiency (less frivolous long-distance trade), making societies less vulnerable. This localist synergy also extends to governance : degrowth supports decentralizing power to communities (thinking of Murray Bookchin’s municipalism or bioregionalism), and PLE explicitly encodes subsidiarity and decentralized decision-making . Thus, both envision a patchwork of human-scale political economy units, richly interconnected but not subordinate to a single growth-driven market logic. Each community could develop in harmony with its local ecology and culture, using shared global knowledge and technology – a pluralistic world model quite unlike the homogenous consumer monoculture of globalization. Ethical and cultural shift: Finally, degrowth and PLE both call for profound changes in cultural values and the purpose of the economy. Degrowth emphasizes conviviality, frugality, and reconnection to nature – a shift from materialistic individualism to community-oriented sufficiency. PLE, while often framed in tech- positive terms, ultimately implies a similar cultural reorientation: if work is no longer central, people will find meaning in creativity, leisure, learning, caregiving, and other non-commercial pursuits. Both paradigms foresee a future where quality of life is divorced from the quantity of consumption . Degrowth speaks of “prosperity without growth” (Tim Jackson) and “convivial society” (Ivan Illich) where humans flourish with less stuff but richer social bonds. PLE implicitly requires that society let go of the Protestant work ethic and the conflation of status with income; it encourages imagining life as “post-consumerist” as well, where with basic needs met and perhaps a universal basic income, people are free to pursue non-material rewards (art, relationships, self-actualization). Indeed, when automation supplies abundance of necessities, the focus of life can turn to what economists call “higher needs” – personal development, community participation, etc. This echoes degrowth’s desired shift in social logic: from having to being . Moreover , both paradigms place emphasis on education and participatory democracy : degrowth sees an active citizenry deliberating on local economies, and PLE, with its talk of DAOs and distributed governance, also sees widespread civic engagement (potentially aided by AI advisors or liquid democracy tools). In sum, the cultural vision of a PLE- degrowth synthesis is one of liberation – liberation from want, from alienating work, and from the obsession with accumulation – replaced by a culture of sustainable well-being and collective agency.89 9 In concrete terms, a comprehensive synthesis might be described as a Post-Labor Post-Growth Society . Imagine a nation that has, by mid-21st century, implemented the following: a universal basic income (funded by profits from publicly-owned automated industries and ecological taxes), a 3-day workweek with most routine work done by machines, free high-quality public services (housing, transit, healthcare, education) ensuring low cost of living, and a network of cooperatives and community organizations managing local food, energy, and manufacturing with near-zero waste. Its economy is measured by metrics like health, happiness, ecosystem integrity, and equality – all improving – while its GDP has stabilized or even gently declined as energy and resource throughput were deliberately pared down year by year . Yet people’s lives are rich: freed from incessant toil and precarious competition, they spend more time on relationships, civic projects, cultural activities, and enjoying nature. Technological infrastructure (AI, robots, IoT) hums in the background, managed as a common good , optimizing resource use and providing transparency so that corruption or waste is quickly detected. Carbon emissions are near zero, biodiversity is recovering, and the society’s material footprint is a fraction of its early-21st-century peak – but human needs are met and then some. This is not a naïve utopia but the logical conclusion of aligning PLE’s technological leverage with degrowth’s ecological wisdom . As one review noted, ideas like using automation to support an economy of sufficiency and well-being within ecological limits “ dovetail ” strongly – PLE provides the means to achieve what degrowth defines as the ends. Of course, such an optimistic synthesis assumes wise implementation. But crucially, PLE makes degrowth politically and economically feasible , while degrowth gives PLE a raison d’être beyond just coping with AI – it becomes a path to a truly sustainable civilization. Together , they enable what neither could achieve alone: a high-tech, post-scarcity society that intentionally reduces its throughput to remain in harmony with the planet. In operational terms, PLE offers tools to “decouple” in ways that were previously deemed impossible, by redefining value and distribution; meanwhile degrowth ensures that any decoupling is put toward downsizing impact rather than expanding consumption. Both demand a reimagining of policies and institutions – from tax codes to property laws to community planning – all oriented toward a new paradigm: prosperity without growth, work without employment, and technology without ecological overshoot . Unresolved Tensions and Challenges While the alignment between degrowth and post-labor economics is promising, there remain unresolved tensions and open questions when attempting to integrate these paradigms. Some aspects of degrowth’s ecological vision may be challenged or complicated by the realities of a high-tech, automated economy , and vice versa. We turn a critical eye to these tensions: 1. The material and energy footprint of the automation stack: One major concern is that the very technological infrastructure enabling a post-labor economy could itself be a source of significant ecological burden. Advanced robotics, AI servers, data centers, and manufacturing automation all require energy and vast amounts of raw materials. Degrowth demands we stay within planetary limits – yet building and powering a global fleet of robots or AI models at scale might strain those limits. For instance, artificial intelligence and cloud computing already have a non-trivial carbon footprint; data centers today consume about 1–2% of global electricity, and with surging AI workloads, they could account for up to 21% of global electricity demand by 2030 . This exponential growth in digital energy use, if powered by fossil fuels, would be utterly incompatible with climate targets. Even if powered by renewables, a 20-fold increase in data center energy draws would require enormous expansion of clean energy infrastructure, with attendant material needs (concrete, metals for solar panels, etc.). Moreover , the hardware itself – millions of robots,4 37 10 sensors, and computers – must be constructed from metals and minerals, many of which have limited supplies and environmentally destructive supply chains. Rare earth elements, lithium, cobalt, high-grade silicon, gold, and others are crucial for electronics and motors. Projections of an automation-heavy future can be staggering. One estimate (admittedly a theoretical scenario popularized by tech optimists like Elon Musk) posits on the order of 10 billion humanoid robots worldwide by 2040; even if this figure is hyperbolic, consider that just 1 billion robots would require on the order of 60 billion kilograms of metal (assuming ~60 kg per robot) . A single humanoid contains significant rare magnets and specialty alloys – in aggregate, 10 billion such robots might need ~600 million tonnes of materials. According to one analysis, that would be 186 times the current annual production of neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets (used in robot motors and wind turbines) . Even a far smaller scale – say tens of millions of robots – implies consuming a large fraction of global output of certain minerals. This raises a red flag: can an automated economy be scaled sustainably , or would it lead to a new wave of resource extraction (deep- sea mining, arctic mining, etc.) to feed the machines? Degrowth scholars would caution that shifting to electric and automated technology doesn’t erase resource constraints ; it merely changes their form. We might move from oil scarcity to lithium scarcity, for example. The PLE vision must contend with the embodied energy and lifecycle impacts of automation hardware. Mining of rare metals is often environmentally ruinous and socially exploitative (as seen in cobalt mines in the Congo, lithium brine extraction impacts in Andes, etc.). One study notes that AI hardware depends on a range of metals often mined in unsustainable or opaque ways, and that “tonnes of earth have to be mined” with toxic waste byproducts to yield small amounts of these elements . From an ecological perspective, this challenges PLE to demonstrate how it will avoid merely shifting the ecological burden upstream – from human labor to machine labor that quietly digs vast new holes in the Earth. Addressing this tension likely requires that PLE explicitly incorporate degrowth principles of scale limitation and material cycling in its technological deployment. If automation is pursued without restraint, it could precipitate rebound effects where cheaper , robot-made products lead to more resource use overall (albeit in different sectors). For PLE to be ecologically coherent, it must embrace strategies like “automation sobriety” – i.e. automate what’s necessary for human well-being, but not an all-out tech arms race of robot ubiquity. The automation stack should be as lean and circular as possible: robots and AI devices must be built for longevity, modular upgrade, and full recyclability, to minimize continual mining of virgin materials. Another approach is to prioritize automation for low-footprint sectors (like dematerialized digital services, or precision agriculture that reduces inputs) and restrain it in high-footprint ones unless renewable resources are ensured. The energy issue is similarly daunting: PLE’s data centers and machine fleets need to run on renewable energy exclusively if they are to align with degrowth’s carbon budget. Even then, as noted, building enough renewables to power an AI-saturated world is a massive undertaking in itself – potentially doable, but requiring high upfront investment and careful land use planning (for solar , wind, etc.). There is also the underappreciated factor of resource competition between green tech and automation: for example, electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and robots all compete for rare metals like neodymium, dysprosium (for magnets), copper , and so on. A society that tries to simultaneously expand renewables, electrify everything, and deploy robots at scale could hit bottlenecks or cause skyrocketing demand for certain minerals. In short, PLE must negotiate the fine line between leveraging technology and becoming enslaved to its resource appetite . If not managed, the quest for automation could provoke new forms of ecological overshoot, just in a different guise – something degrowthers will keenly point out. Researchers in the “ICT for sustainability” field are increasingly aware of this: efficiency improvements in AI and hardware are vital, but so is tempering the growth of demand. Some projections suggest data center electricity use could more than double by 2026 due to AI, “surpassing Canada’s national power use” – leading certain regions to even impose moratoria on new data centers. This indicates that,38 39 40 41 11 in practice, governance may need to put brakes on certain high-impact tech expansions for environmental reasons, a very degrowth-like stance. 2. Governance complexity and scalability of decentralized systems: Both PLE and degrowth extol decentralization and local autonomy, but implementing this in a large, complex society raises non-trivial challenges. Modern economies benefit from certain centralized coordinations (for instance, national grid management, large-scale infrastructure, universal standards) that cannot be replaced entirely by local decisions without risking fragmentation or inefficiency. There is a tension between PLE’s bottom-up subsidiarity and the need for global coordination on global commons issues (like climate change, biodiversity, pollution of the oceans). Degrowth is acutely aware of global commons problems – climate mitigation, for example, inherently requires coordinated action and enforcement across all nations (one locality cannot stabilize the climate alone). If PLE’s emphasis on local governance were taken to an extreme of neo-medieval decentralism, one could worry about how things like a global carbon budget or international trade rules for sustainability would be negotiated and upheld. Similarly, in a world of myriad DAOs and cooperatives, who handles large-scale redistribution or balancing of resources between regions? Degrowth also demands global equity – the resource claims of the Global North must shrink to allow the Global South space to develop. That implies some form of international governance or at least agreements (e.g. a framework for contraction and convergence of emissions, or rules against ecologically unequal exchange). Highly decentralized PLE structures might struggle to reach and enforce such agreements unless there are still higher-level institutions with legitimacy. Another aspect is the complexity of managing decentralized high-tech systems . PLE assumes that AI and automation can actually assist in governance (e.g., AI-managed local economies). But this introduces new governance issues: how to ensure the algorithms themselves are aligned with human and ecological values? Who sets the objectives for an AGI managing city planning? If those systems are opaque or fall under influence of particular groups, it could undermine the democratic intent. Indeed, early experiments with decentralized governance (like blockchain DAOs) have shown issues like voter apathy , capture by insiders (“whales”) , and difficulty in making hard but necessary decisions. PLE’s principle that “hidden information enables exploitation” , hence requiring radical transparency, is well-taken; however , absolute transparency can conflict with privacy and with decision-making efficiency. There is a push-pull: too little transparency (status quo corporate secrecy) is bad, but too much transparency (every minor decision subject to public scrutiny) can lead to paralysis or conflict. We might need new governance innovations (delegative democracy, sortition-based councils, AI auditors) to navigate this. In short, the governance load in a PLE/degrowth system might be high – citizens and AI agents engaging in continuous participatory management of economic life. That could either be wonderfully democratic or chaotically unmanageable. Degrowth’s critics often argue that a planned contraction would require authoritarian measures; degrowthers counter that local direct democracy can replace top-down control. PLE sides with the latter view, but achieving consensus or coordination among countless local entities is an open problem. There’s a risk of a patchwork of policies : e.g. some towns enforce strict degrowth and sharing, others become enclaves of techno-libertarian hyper-consumption (especially if PLE tech makes production so cheap that some communities exploit it for luxury). Without some overarching regulation or value framework, decentralization could lead to “leakage” – unsustainable practices simply moving to less regulated locales. In addition, the transitional governance needs are enormous: we would be reinventing the social contract (the PLE literature even calls for a “New Social Contract” beyond the labor-capital mediation ). Historically, such transitions (e.g. the New Deal, or post-war social democracies) involved strong central governments implementing uniform policies like social security, taxes, etc., often against resistance of20 42 12 capital. How would a highly decentralized transition manage to orchestrate, say, a nationwide UBI or a coordinated reduction of working hours? One could imagine a scenario where a few progressive cities implement post-labor policies, but others do not, leading to migration and tension. This is not insoluble – perhaps the network of localities could share best practices and voluntarily harmonize certain standards. Nonetheless, governance in a post-labor degrowth context may need multi-level approaches : local for fine-grained matters, but still robust national or federated institutions for redistribution and macro-stability. PLE’s notion of building “decentralization infrastructure” and legal frameworks acknowledges this: it implies a role for higher authorities to guarantee the decentralized systems (e.g., legal recognition of DAOs, antitrust to prevent new monopolies, etc.). Balancing autonomy with coordination remains a design challenge. 3. Ecological limits of digital and data infrastructure: Beyond energy and materials, there are ecological (and social) limits related to the digital backbone of a PLE economy. Large-scale AI and automation require not just electricity, but also cooling water , land for server farms, and steady supplies of high-tech components. For example, data centers use significant water for cooling – Microsoft’s global water consumption jumped 34% in one year largely due to AI server cooling . If PLE relies heavily on cloud and AI systems, it must reckon with water stress, especially as climate change makes water scarcer in many regions. Degrowth would advise paring down such intensive demands or siting them carefully. Similarly, e- waste is a growing issue: the more electronics are ubiquitous, the more waste unless circular schemes are perfected. PLE must ensure that all its IoT sensors, drones, robots can be recovered and recycled, or else degrowth would object that it’s creating another toxic legacy (as today’s short-lived consumer electronics do). Another limit is biodiversity impact : mining for rare metals, huge solar/wind farms, and even land used for data center buildings all can harm ecosystems. A concern here is the potential rebound effect in data and services – just as physical efficiency can spur more consumption, making AI and digital services cheap could lead to an explosion of usage (think: billions of AI queries, endless streaming, ubiquitous robots in every niche). This digital rebound could indirectly harm ecosystems by energy use or by encouraging more extraction for infrastructure. For instance, highly efficient 3D printing might lower costs such that people print far more stuff (some of it frivolous), thereby not reducing overall material throughput as hoped. Both degrowth and PLE need to guard against these second-order rebounds. There is an emerging concept of “data sufficiency” – limiting certain uses of data/AI that do not contribute enough value relative to their footprint. PLE so far has championed automation as an overall good, but a degrowth lens might ask: do we really need AI in every aspect of life? Perhaps in a sustainable PLE, some high-tech solutions are eschewed if their net impact is negative. For example, using AI for advertising and consumer manipulation (to induce more consumption) would be clearly counterproductive to degrowth; thus one could ban or curtail such applications. Another example: fully autonomous vehicles might enable people to live far out and commute more (because they can work or relax while the car drives), increasing sprawl – a rebound that hurts land use and emissions. A PLE that is also degrowth-aware would implement strong policy constraints to prevent such rebounds: e.g. land use policies against sprawl, or discouraging unnecessary high-energy AI usages. This again comes down to governance and values – just because something is technologically possible doesn’t mean it should be deployed at scale . In a joint PLE-degrowth paradigm, one must sometimes say “no” to certain innovations or at least guide them with heavy regulation for the sake of ecological integrity. This clashes with any techno-libertarian streaks in PLE that might assume all automation progress is good. It brings a degree of precautionary principle from degrowth into PLE’s techno-optimism.36 43 13 4. Potential socio-economic rebound effects and demand inducement: One worry specific to combining these paradigms is that the abundance created by PLE could erode the frugality ethos of degrowth. If goods become very cheap and widely available thanks to automation, will people not be tempted to consume more, even if their fundamental needs are met? For example, if robots and AI make housing, food, and energy virtually free, people might then devote their UBI or free time to traveling frequently (with associated environmental costs), or consuming more entertainment electronics, etc. In effect, human desires might expand when basic needs no longer constrain them – a kind of Jevons paradox of human aspiration. Degrowth philosophy calls for redefining prosperity in terms of enoughness and sufficiency. But PLE’s promise of abundance could make sufficiency a harder sell: why restrain consumption when production is so easy and “clean”? This touches on an age-old debate: do we trust technological efficiency to solve environmental issues, or do we also need self-restraint? Degrowth sides with the latter; PLE sides with the former to some degree. If PLE’s faith in green automation were too high, it could lead to complacency about consumption levels. For instance, widespread 3D printing might reduce waste per product, but if everyone prints countless gadgets because it’s essentially costless, the aggregate resource use might not drop. In an automated economy with UBI, people have time and some disposable income – they might travel more, or engage in resource-intensive hobbies unless guided by new norms. Lifestyle rebound is a real risk: historically, when work hours dropped (e.g. retirement, shorter weeks), sometimes leisure activities increased energy use (more driving, long vacations, etc.). The challenge is to ensure that free time is used in low-footprint, high-value ways (e.g. local community building, arts, sports, enjoying nature) rather than high-footprint ones (e.g. flying frequently). Encouraging a cultural shift toward post-consumerist values is crucial, and arguably degrowth’s domain. PLE alone, if interpreted in a purely economic sense, might insufficiently address this cultural dimension. The two paradigms need each other here: PLE provides the means for material security, but degrowth provides the ethos of sufficiency. If that ethos doesn’t take hold, rebound effects could indeed undermine ecological gains. In economic terms, if productive efficiency soars, degrowth would advocate taking the gains in reduced throughput and work , whereas a growth logic would take it in more output . There is a tension: PLE’s scenario could be co-opted by a capitalist framework to just increase output and profits (with very few workers). That is essentially the “cornucopian” future that degrowthers critique (unlimited growth via tech). Ensuring the PLE future doesn’t slide into that requires intentional limit-setting. Some degrowth advocates, for example, would propose caps or quotas on resource use – an absolute cap on, say, annual carbon emissions, material extraction, etc., ratcheting down over time. How would that mesh with PLE’s open-ended automation? Ideally, automation would operate within those caps (e.g. AI systems are tasked with optimizing under a carbon budget). But if, say, robot-made goods become extremely popular , pressure might mount to loosen environmental caps (“why hold back, since robots make it so cheap, think of the benefits!”). Political will must be maintained to stick to limits, which might be challenging if the public is entranced by new possibilities of consumption. In essence, abundance management becomes a policy field: distinguishing between benign abundance (things that improve quality of life with minimal impact, like free education, digital goods) and destructive abundance (cheap gas-guzzling vehicles, etc. if they were automated into abundance). We would likely need deliberate disincentives or bans for certain products even if they could be cheap – which is philosophically acceptable to degrowth but might seem anathema to pure techno-libertarians. 5. Social acceptance and psychological factors: There is also a less technical tension: degrowth calls for voluntary transformations in how we live and work – consuming less, valuing non-material wealth, accepting a “smaller economy”. PLE calls for reliance on machines, giving up control over many tasks to AI, and redefining work and purpose. Both require profound psychological and social adaptation . It’s 14 unclear how smoothly people will accept a post-labor identity; many derive meaning and dignity from work, and may resist a future where they feel redundant or where their role is unclear . Degrowth too has an image problem: people equate it with austerity or losing comforts. The synthesis tries to alleviate that (“post-labor abundance without ecological harm”), but there’s a tension between comfort provided by tech and discipline provided by ethics . Will people embrace a life of leisure, creativity, and communal activities if offered a UBI and no job? Or will there be social malaise, loss of self-worth, or backlash demanding a return to “normal work” for psychological comfort? PLE enthusiasts argue that new forms of meaning will flourish (more volunteering, arts, etc.), and degrowth folks say that community and nature connection will substitute the void of consumerism. However , this cultural transition is uncertain and constitutes a soft risk – if mishandled, it could lead to reactionary politics (e.g., populations demanding old industrial jobs back, or populist movements against automation). We already see some of this in resistance to globalization and automation in various countries. It suggests that unless the benefits of PLE are very clearly and fairly distributed, and unless people are educated and prepared for the lifestyle changes of degrowth, a societal consensus will be hard to maintain. In summary, the unresolved tensions cluster around ensuring that the cure does not inadvertently replicate the disease in new form . A post-labor economy must not become a new engine of excess resource use or power concentration. The ecological limits – energy, materials, land, water – put hard constraints on how far automation can go; degrowth insists those constraints be respected through binding limits. The governance challenge is to enforce those limits and steer tech development accordingly, which may conflict with laissez-faire or purely local approaches. Rebound effects, both material and behavioral, loom as cautionary tales that efficiency alone doesn’t guarantee sustainability. PLE will have to integrate feedback mechanisms (perhaps via pricing externalities or capping resource use) to avoid rebounds, essentially merging degrowth’s preventive approach with its own innovations . Moreover , the pace of transition could be a tension: degrowth advocates urgency in cutting emissions (within a decade or two), whereas building a full post-labor automation infrastructure is a multi-decade project; reconciling these timelines (rapidly degrowthing dirty sectors while gradually automating sustainable sectors) is complex and could leave gaps (e.g., energy use must drop now, but widespread robotization of renewables might come later). Bridging that requires intentional planning and perhaps interim measures like strong conservation policies – which PLE might be less focused on if it assumes tech will solve issues eventually. Ultimately, these tensions do not invalidate the synergy but highlight the need for careful integrated design of a post-labor , post-growth economy. It won’t happen automatically or peacefully without strategic governance. It calls for unprecedented foresight to avoid new pitfalls: ensuring technology serves ecological goals, not vice versa . Governance, from local to global, must evolve to handle a decentralized yet interconnected world. Human values and culture must shift to relish the freedom from toil without indulging in new excess. These are non-trivial challenges – but acknowledging them is the first step to solving them. As researchers note, the field is nascent and must grapple with both “direct and indirect effects” of AI and tech, recognizing that efficiency gains alone won’t save us without broader socio- economic change . The degrowth perspective injects that wisdom into PLE’s optimism. Conversely, PLE’s dynamism and innovation push degrowth to think in new, creative directions rather than just contraction. Navigating these tensions will be the work of coming decades – requiring interdisciplinary collaboration, experiments, and perhaps entirely new institutions.744 4546 15 Final Synthesis and Recommendations The exploration above leads to a clear conclusion: degrowth and post-labor economics, when combined, sketch the outline of a viable and desirable future – a “post-growth, post-work” civilization that achieves sustainable prosperity . However , realizing this vision demands deliberate strategy, further research, and courageous policy innovation. In this final synthesis, we distill key insights and offer recommendations for moving from theory to practice, as well as a high-level vision of how such a transformed economy might function. Key Insights from the Synergy: A New Economic Paradigm is Emerging: The marriage of degrowth’s ecological realism with PLE’s technological optimism yields what we might call a paradigm of “sustainable abundance” . It rejects the 20th-century formula of growth = prosperity, and replaces it with prosperity through efficiency, equity, and sufficiency . This paradigm measures success by human and ecological well-being, not by output. It uses technology as a tool to reduce impact and liberate humans , not as an end to drive more consumption. It treats planetary boundaries as non-negotiable constraints and human dignity (decoupled from work) as a non-negotiable foundation. This represents nothing less than a new purpose for economic activity in the 21st century. Mutual Reinforcement of Social and Ecological Goals: We have seen that PLE mechanisms (automation, universal basic income, decentralized systems) can directly enable degrowth objectives by solving the growth-employment dilemma and providing high living standards without high throughput . Conversely, degrowth’s insistence on limits and sufficiency guides PLE to deploy automation in a way that genuinely reduces environmental pressure rather than exacerbating it . The synergy is such that each paradigm addresses the other’s potential weaknesses: degrowth ensures PLE’s tech bounty doesn’t create new scarcities or ecological overshoot, while PLE ensures degrowth’s contraction doesn’t cause social collapse or poverty. This symbiosis is a powerful argument against the false dichotomy often posed between “green technology” and “reducing consumption” – we clearly need both together . Technology won’t save us without post-growth values, and degrowth won’t succeed without technological and institutional innovation. Centrality of Equity and Redistribution: Both paradigms highlight that a fair distribution of resources and power is key. In practice, this means any transition strategy must include robust redistributive policies – progressive taxation of carbon and wealth, social ownership of key automated industries or platforms, expansion of public services, and community wealth-building. The wealth generated by productivity gains should be socialized to fund the social foundations (health, education, housing) and universal income floors. This is not just ethically desirable but practically necessary: without visible broad benefits, the public will not support radical changes. Moreover , equitable access to the means of sustenance (food, energy, information) reduces the risk of rebound: when people feel secure, they are more open to sufficiency and less driven by fear to accumulate or consume excessively . Thus, policies like UBI, universal basic services, or public dividends are not only post-labor measures but also degrowth enablers. Institutional Innovation is as important as Technological Innovation: A sustainable post-labor economy will not arise spontaneously from market forces; it requires purposeful institutional design . New institutions might include: Public Trusts that hold and manage automated infrastructure• • 31 4 29 • 35 • 16 on behalf of all (e.g., a national “Robot Fund” that pays citizen dividends); Local Commons Institutions for managing community resources (energy co-ops, land trusts, makerspaces); Participatory Planning Forums where citizens decide priorities for downscaling certain industries or investing in others; Algorithmic governance frameworks ensuring AI is transparent and aligned with public values, potentially even an “AI Commons” where key algorithms are open-source and managed democratically. Legal frameworks need updating: for instance, recognizing DAOs as legal entities, mandating environmental accounting and long-term impact assessments in business charters, and extending rights (or at least guardians) to future generations and ecosystems. Experimentation will be key – pilot programs for basic income (as in Finland’s experiment ), trials of four-day workweeks (already underway in some firms and regions), city-level deployments of circular economies (like zero-waste cities, sharing platforms) all provide learning ground. A recommendation is to establish a global knowledge commons of post-growth/post-labor experiments , so successes can be scaled and failures learned from. Cultural and Educational Transformation: At root, both degrowth and PLE involve a profound cultural shift. Thus, part of the blueprint must involve investing in education, discourse, and narrative change . We should promote what one might call “ecological-literacy and post-labor literacy” across society. This means incorporating into curricula the concepts of planetary boundaries, the pitfalls of GDP, the possibilities of automation for social good, and the value of non-market activities. We also need new narratives – stories and visions of what a fulfilling life in a post-growth, post-work society looks like. This can be through art, media, scenario workshops, etc. The more people can imagine this future, the less frightening the transition will seem. Degrowth often emphasizes well- being improvements (more leisure, community, health) from consuming and working less; PLE emphasizes creative freedom and new opportunities when machines toil for us. Marrying these into a compelling vision – “Work less, live more, within Earth’s means, thanks to our smart stewardship of technology” – should be an ongoing project. A recommendation is for public campaigns and deliberative forums to engage citizens in co-creating visions of a post-labor green future. Rather than a top-down imposition, the transition must be a democratic, inclusive project where people see their values reflected. Policy Convergence (“no-regret” policies): There are several policies that both degrowth and PLE advocates endorse, making them obvious starting points. These include: drastic reduction in working hours (without loss of livelihood), which addresses unemployment, improves life quality, and can reduce production-driven impacts ; job guarantee/public employment in green and care sectors , to manage the transition for those who still want work or to ensure essential human services are not neglected (degrowth doesn’t mean no human work, just less futile work – caring professions and environmental restoration could be expanded); universal basic income or dividend schemes , which as discussed free people from the growth imperative ; ban or heavy tax on environmentally destructive or socially useless industries , like coal mining, ultra-luxury goods, planned obsolescence products (both paradigms would agree these need to be phased out); massive investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency , which is an urgent degrowth requirement and also fits PLE’s tech orientation; support for cooperative and commons-based business models , aligning with subsidiarity and local empowerment; carbon pricing or caps that internalize climate externalities (degrowth tool) and incentivize automation to be clean; and resource caps/quotas for key materials to drive circular innovation. Implementing these policies in tandem can start bending the trajectory towards both lower throughput and more equitable distribution – essentially, the first steps into the new paradigm. They are “no-regret” in the sense that47 • • 24 31 17 even if one were skeptical of degrowth or PLE, these policies address present issues (work-life balance, inequality, climate) and would yield benefits under current conditions. Future Directions for Research and Implementation: While the theoretical groundwork is being laid, many practical questions remain that call for research and experimentation. For instance: Economic modeling of post-labor degrowth scenarios: We need quantitative scenarios to understand how an economy performs with zero growth, high automation, and redistributive mechanisms. What happens to productivity, inflation (if any), interest rates, etc.? How to manage money supply in a non- growth context? Early work (like the systematic review by Dehouche ) is starting to incorporate degrowth ideas into post-labor analysis, but further modeling could help policymakers plan the transition (e.g., how big does UBI need to be to maintain demand if consumption falls in some sectors? How to avoid deflationary spirals?). Pilot projects: We recommend creating model regions or cities that actively implement a bundle of degrowth and PLE-aligned policies – essentially living laboratories of the post-growth, post-work economy. This could involve a town that tries a local currency or credit system to encourage circular local trade, implements a community-wide basic income (perhaps via dividend from a local solar farm or other enterprise), drastically cuts working hours, and uses participatory budgeting to steer local development toward low-carbon, high well-being projects. By monitoring such pilots, researchers can gather data on social outcomes, environmental outcomes, and adjust policy designs. Some cities (like Amsterdam with its “doughnut economy” initiative, or various well-being economy cities) are moving in this direction. These efforts should be supported and evaluated rigorously. Technology assessment through degrowth lens: For upcoming technologies (AI advancements, bioeconomy, etc.), research should proactively assess their net impact potential and guide development accordingly. This may mean developing metrics like “energy intensity per AI operation” or “material footprint per robot over lifecycle” and setting target improvements (akin to Moores law, but for sustainability). It also means identifying which technologies could be degrowth multipliers (enabling large reductions in footprint) and prioritizing those for investment. Examples might include AI for smart grids (to integrate 100% renewables), or automation in building retrofitting (to scale up energy efficiency), or lab-grown materials to replace resource-intensive ones. By focusing R&D on such areas, we channel PLE’s innovative spirit directly into degrowth objectives. Social innovations and cultural evolution: How to facilitate the cultural shift is an interdisciplinary research question. Psychologists, anthropologists, and sociologists should examine communities already living in lower-consumption or post-work lifestyles (e.g., ecovillages, “voluntary simplicity” groups, early retirees, etc.) to glean insights on well-being and identify what cultural supports are needed. Perhaps new rituals or community practices will emerge when work is less central (imagine civic assemblies, maker fairs, etc. becoming more common gatherings). Understanding human needs for purpose and recognition will be key to designing non-work-based avenues for fulfillment (like structured volunteering programs, arts initiatives, education in later life, etc.). Policies can then be crafted to encourage these (for example, a “service guarantee” alongside a job guarantee – guaranteeing everyone a way to contribute meaningfully if they wish, whether or not it’s paid). • 47 • • • 18 In terms of strategic implementation , we must recognize that entrenched interests will resist many of these changes. The notion of degrowth challenges powerful fossil fuel companies, the notion of post-labor challenges big tech and capital owners who prefer to monopolize automation’s rewards. Therefore, building political coalitions is crucial. Unions, oddly enough, could become allies if they shift from solely protecting jobs to protecting workers’ livelihoods in a post-job world – some labor movements have started discussing shorter workweeks and UBI. Environmentalists and social justice activists are natural allies for this agenda. We might see the formation of what could be termed a “Post-Growth Alliance” bringing together climate justice, labor rights, tech ethicists, and commons-oriented groups, united by the recognition that the current system is untenable and something fundamentally new is needed. A Vision of a Sustainable Post-Labor, Post-Growth Economy: Let us finally articulate a concise vision that synthesizes everything – a scenario illustrating “ecological realism and technological leverage” in harmony. By the year 2050, imagine a country (perhaps a coalition of progressive nations) that has formally adopted a post-growth economic framework. It long ago abandoned GDP targeting; instead, it tracks indicators like the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), measures of habitat restoration, and a “Wellbeing Index” that surveys health, education, equality, and happiness. Over decades, it carefully scaled down material throughput: fossil fuels are virtually eliminated, overall material use (metal ores, biomass, etc.) has been cut by half from peak, primarily through improved design, recycling, and shifts in consumption patterns. This was achieved via policies (caps, taxes, public investment in alternatives) and by social changes (people prefer durable goods, repair cafes abound, meat consumption is rare, etc.). Yet, living standards have not suffered – on the contrary, by conventional measures like median health and satisfaction, they have improved. How? Automation and post-labor institutions have re-engineered the provisioning systems. Agriculture, for example, is largely handled by regenerative farming practices augmented with robotics and AI precision – producing healthy food with minimal inputs and land, employing relatively few humans full- time but many part-time community farmers. Energy is supplied 100% by renewables, managed by an AI grid that balances supply and demand meticulously; thanks to energy efficiency and moderate demand, total energy use is lower than in 2020, but it suffices for everyone’s needs. People live in well-insulated, modest but comfortable housing (often co-housing), with local production of building materials (like carbon-neutral concrete alternatives and sustainably harvested timber , cut and assembled mostly by automated factories). Every citizen receives a Universal Basic Dividend – a monthly stipend that comes from a national fund which pools revenues from resource rents (e.g., carbon pricing in earlier years, land value capture) and returns from publicly owned enterprises (for instance, an AI-driven pharmaceutical sector that produces generic drugs cheaply, or public data centers renting out computing power). This dividend, plus extensive public services, secures life’s necessities. Work as traditionally conceived has become optional : many people choose to work 10–20 hours a week in occupations they find meaningful – perhaps as a nurse, a teacher , an artisan, a researcher – but there is no stigma in not having a formal job. People engage heavily in voluntary and community work : neighborhood assemblies, local environmental projects, mentoring, cultural festivals. Because of the UBI and shorter official workweeks, there is a flourishing of civic life and arts. The economy is populated by cooperatives and decentralized organizations . A lot of businesses are worker or community-owned, often supported by AI in management (no bloated managerial hierarchies 19 siphoning profits). Many routine services (transport, maintenance, administrative tasks) are handled by AI or simple robots – ubiquitous computing is a utility, like electricity. However , this automation is deployed under strict environmental and ethical guidelines: for example, planned obsolescence of devices is illegal – all tech must be designed for easy upgrading and recycling; AI algorithms are required to be transparent and audited for bias or resource waste. Algorithms serve the people , often through public oversight bodies that include citizens and experts reviewing major AI systems (like those in healthcare or urban planning). Local self-reliance is a striking feature: every region produces a substantial share of its food and goods. 3D printing makerspaces in each town allow people to fabricate or repair everyday items – designs are often open-source and shared globally in a commons, but adapted locally. The transportation of goods has reduced drastically: why import bottled water or basic furniture when it can be made locally? International trade still exists, but it’s focused on essential materials not available everywhere and high-value durable goods; container traffic volume is perhaps a quarter of what it was in 2020. People travel more by electric trains and less by personal cars or planes, partly because there’s simply less rush – with more free time, the journey itself is enjoyed slowly, and telepresence via advanced virtual reality has cut down the urge for constant business travel. Importantly, the mindset of society has shifted . The population understands that they live on a finite planet and that overconsumption was a folly of the past. Children grow up learning ecological principles, gardening, and coding with equal emphasis. The culture celebrates creativity, knowledge, and community contribution; material excess is actually considered gauche (similar to how smoking became socially disapproved). Status comes from one’s skills, wisdom, or service to others, not from owning extravagant things. Because basic needs are met and inequality is low (the highest incomes are maybe 5x the lowest, largely due to a cap and taxation; extreme wealth accumulation is impossible now), there is a general sense of economic security and solidarity. This removes the fear that drove growth – no one is afraid of losing their job and falling into poverty, so people are more open to stability or downsizing in harmful sectors. In governance, participatory democracy complements representative structures. At local levels, assemblies or e-democracy platforms allow citizens to allocate budgets (which are ample for public goods since spending has shifted from military and advertising and luxury goods towards schools, parks, healthcare). At the national level, long-term councils (with citizen inclusion) set binding targets for resource use and emissions which technocratic agencies and AI models then implement in detail – essentially planning within limits , but with the flexibility and data-crunching power of AI to avoid the inefficiencies of old central planning. Policy decisions consider the wellbeing of future generations and other species explicitly – perhaps there is even a “Guardian House” in the legislature that has veto power over laws contravening environmental boundaries, effectively institutionalizing the rights of nature. Economically, the system might be described as a form of “prosperous steady-state” : capital stocks are maintained or improved in quality rather than expanded in quantity. The overall scale of the economy in material terms is stable or slowly contracting to a sustainable level, but development (qualitative improvement) continues: e.g., the energy system gets smarter and cleaner , medical innovations emerge (many researched by AI), art and science flourish. GDP is no longer tracked religiously, but if one computed it, it might be lower than mid-21st century due to decommodification (lots of value is delivered outside markets) and shorter supply chains. But that is no concern, because employment is not needed to distribute income and because public services cover what matters. 20 The private sector still exists but is reimagined: many entrepreneurs produce open-source designs or collaborate in platform cooperatives; profit motives are tempered by strong liability for externalities and by stakeholder governance models. There are still markets, especially at the local level for farmers markets, crafts, and so forth – but advertising is heavily regulated (no more manipulative consumerist advertising, only informational) and products have eco-labels by law. With transparency, if a company abuses labor or nature, it’s quickly known and their social license evaporates; consumers tend to favor the sustainable option thanks to decades of education and the social norms in place. In sum, this vision shows a society that has achieved the goals of degrowth – ecological stability, reduced consumption, focus on wellbeing – by using the tools and principles of PLE – automation, distribution of wealth, and new governance technologies . It is a “post-labor, post-growth economy” where humans are free both from material want and from the compulsion of pointless toil, where progress is measured in regeneration of ecosystems and enrichment of human experiences. It’s a society that views economy as a subset of ecology and technology as a subset of humanity’s collective toolset, not as a master . It embodies ecological realism in that it never asks the Earth to give more than it can, and technological leverage in that it makes clever use of human ingenuity to improve life within those means. To conclude, the blueprint for sustainable growth (in human terms, not GDP) through degrowth and post- labor economics is no longer a mere utopia but a guiding framework grounded in empirical understanding and emerging practice. We recommend that policymakers, scholars, and communities start implementing these ideas stepwise: establish comprehensive wellbeing budgeting, pilot basic income, incentivize cooperative automation, legislate shorter workweeks, and enforce environmental limits as immediate measures. Simultaneously, invest in public dialog and education to reshape aspirations away from consumerism and towards holistic flourishing. Further research should refine the design of institutions and transition pathways, especially addressing the tensions identified (resource caps, governance models, rebound management). The challenges are undoubtedly immense – this is a civilizational transformation on par with the Industrial Revolution, but consciously directed towards a different end goal. Yet the cost of inaction is far greater: clinging to a growth-and-labor paradigm is ecologically suicidal and socially destabilizing in the face of automation. In embracing degrowth and PLE together , we are in effect crafting a new social contract for the 21st century : one that redefines progress, reorients technology, and restores balance between humanity and nature. The vision that emerges is one of “technologically enlightened frugality” , or as Jason Hickel phrases it, “radical abundance” – not abundance of useless stuff, but abundance of free time, public goods, health, friendship, and creative possibilities . This treatise has argued that such a future is not only necessary to avoid ecological collapse, but is indeed attainable and desirable. It is a future where efficiency replaces excess, sufficiency replaces scarcity, and cooperation replaces compulsion . The blueprint is drawn; the task now is to implement it, step by step, with humility and determination, knowing that we stand at a crossroads of history. By realigning our economic first principles with the realities of our planet and the potential of our innovations, we can build a society that is both sustainable and liberating – a society where growth is not measured in GDP but in the flourishing of life itself.
