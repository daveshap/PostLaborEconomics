The Political and Social Consequences of Labor’s Decline: A Historical and Contemporary Analysis Introduction Labor power – the collective economic and political strength of working people – has long been a foundation of civil rights, democratic governance, and the social value placed on human life. Across eras and societies, when workers and peasants have enjoyed leverage (through independent landholding, free labor status, or robust labor organizations), states have been more accountable and citizens’ rights better protected. Conversely, when labor power declines or is forcibly suppressed, history reveals a pattern of eroding civil liberties, rising autocracy, and a diminished regard for human dignity. This report examines this dynamic comprehensively. It surveys historical examples ranging from ancient agrarian empires to modern industrial states, demonstrating that declines in labor’s power base often presaged or directly caused catastrophic social and political consequences . It then presents evidence that labor power is in clear decline today – especially in advanced post-industrial economies – through falling unionization, shrinking labor share of income, the decoupling of wages from productivity, and legal or structural barriers to worker organization. Finally, it addresses why proposals to substitute other economic measures (such as Universal Basic Income or public wealth dividends) for labor’s influence, absent deeper institutional reforms, are unlikely to reverse these trends. The aim is not to offer policy prescriptions but to prove empirically that the decline of labor power is politically and socially calamitous, is actively underway, and cannot be simply “fixed” with technocratic solutions short of qualitatively stronger civic infrastructure and redistributive institutions. Throughout, the report marshals historical facts and current data to support this thesis. From the collapse of the Equal-Field System in ancient China and the dispossession of yeoman farmers in the Roman Republic, to the suppression of trade unions under fascist regimes and in apartheid South Africa, we will see how losses in labor’s bargaining position aligned with the loss of rights and rise of tyranny. We will then examine today’s advanced economies, where labor unions have dramatically weakened and workers’ share in prosperity has fallen – developments with worrying implications for democracy. Finally, we will critically assess the notion that schemes like UBI or sovereign wealth dividends could replace organized labor’s role, noting the structural challenges and insufficiency of such measures on their own. The evidence amassed paints a stark warning: labor’s decline is not just an economic trend, but a fundamental threat to democratic society . Reversing or mitigating this decline requires more than cash transfers – it demands rebuilding the collective power and institutions that historically undergird broad-based rights and accountability.

The following case studies illustrate how declining labor power often led to heightened inequality, authoritarian governance, or outright social collapse. In each case, labor power is defined in the terms relevant to that society: for peasants, it might mean secure access to land and freedom from bondage; for urban workers, the right to organize or earn a fair wage. As these examples show, when such forms of labor power were lost, the consequences included not only economic hardship but also political repression and devaluation of human life . Ancient China: The Equal-Field System’s Collapse and Imperial Control One of the earliest illustrations comes from ancient China , where the relationship between peasant labor and state power was pivotal. During the Northern Wei Dynasty in 485 CE, and later under the Tang Dynasty, the imperial state implemented the Equal-Field System (juntian system) – a land policy that allotted agricultural land to households in equal shares to be farmed by free peasants . This system was explicitly designed to empower the peasantry as independent smallholders and prevent the unchecked expansion of great estates. By ensuring that most farming families had direct access to land, the state maximized the number of free peasants available for taxation and corvée labor , rather than having the rural population sink into slavery or tenancy under aristocratic landlords . In essence, the government recognized that its own strength – in revenue and manpower – depended on preserving the autonomy and productivity of peasant laborers. As one analysis notes, “The power of the central government… depended on an arrangement that maximized the number of free peasants as opposed to slaves… The Northern Wei passed an ‘equal field’ system… which would stop the growing concentration of land to landlords, who sought to work the field with slaves” . By curbing land monopolization, the Equal-Field System slowed the accumulation of vast latifundia and kept peasants from falling into serf-like dependence . This fostered a period of relative social stability and prosperity – peasants had secure livelihoods, and the state could count on their support (through taxes and service), creating a reciprocal legitimacy that undergirded civil order . However , this equilibrium was not to last. By the mid-Tang Dynasty (8th century), population growth and official malfeasance began to undermine the Equal-Field System . The pool of available land per farmer shrank, and emperors granted large tracts to court favorites and generals, concentrating land ownership once again in elite hands . Moreover , as the Tang government’s expenses mounted (lavish court life and military campaigns), it increased taxes on the peasant farmers beyond sustainable levels . Historical records describe how peasants, squeezed by excessive taxation and corvée labor demands, abandoned their farms or sold their allotted land to wealthy landlords, preferring tenancy or even slavery under local magnates to the impossible burdens imposed by the state . By fleeing the tax rolls in this way, peasants unintentionally weakened the central government’s revenue base, creating a vicious cycle of fiscal crisis and further predation on those who remained. The breakdown of the Equal-Field System after the devastating An Lushan Rebellion of 755 CE accelerated this process: the state lost effective control over land distribution , and an open market in land re-emerged . With imperial authority weakened by war and rebellion, wealthy families seized the opportunity to engross land holdings , buying out or forcing out smallholders. As a contemporary summary puts it, “The abandonment of12 1 1 3 4 2 2 25 67 4 2 the equal-field system meant that people could buy and sell land freely. Many poor [farmers] fell into debt… forced to sell their land to the wealthy, which led to the exponential growth of large estates” . The collapse of peasant land tenure had profound political and human consequences in late Tang and subsequent eras. Local warlords and hereditary landlords gained power as the state retreated from rural administration, reducing the once-robust imperial governance to a nominal tax collector over fragmented fiefdoms . The Tang government, for instance, after 755 could do little more than acknowledge the autonomy of regional governors and rely on them (and their private armies) to maintain order , at the cost of official authority . The centuries following saw Chinese peasants largely at the mercy of landlords; the central state “barely interfered in agricultural management… for roughly a millennium” , save occasional reforms . Without secure land rights or recourse against exploitation, peasants’ civil standing deteriorated . The great estates that formed were often worked by semi-bonded tenants or former freeholders reduced to quasi-serfdom , with little legal protection. As one history notes, the unequal landholding after the Equal-Field System’s demise had a “negative effect on… political liberalism” – landlords dominated local society, and commoners had few avenues to justice or upward mobility . Peasant uprisings became recurrent – for example, the late Tang saw massive rebellions (like the Huang Chao Rebellion of 874–884) rooted in the “extreme social instability and heavy financial burdens placed on the peasants” . These bloody revolts, met with brutal repression, underscored how cheaply human life was now valued : destitute farmers were driven to desperation, and regimes treated mass death as a price of maintaining the status quo. In short, once the broad base of independent peasant labor was eroded, China’s rulers no longer felt the same constraints to govern humanely or accountably . The social contract had frayed: the state lost direct reliance on free peasants (turning instead to landlords or warlords for revenue and order), and with that loss came diminished regard for peasant welfare. As the historical record shows, over-taxation, famine, and atrocity could run rampant in later dynasties (e.g. the casual slaughter of peasant rebels or neglect during natural disasters) without the check that a broad class of empowered smallholders might have provided. In summary, ancient China’s Equal-Field System illustrates how empowering labor (in this case, peasant farmers with land) promoted stability and accountability , whereas its collapse led to concentrated wealth, oppressive taxation, and political turmoil . The decline of labor power in the countryside – from free taxpayer-farmers to disenfranchised tenants – went hand in hand with a slide into autocratic feudalism . The Tang dynasty’s waning decades and subsequent Song/Yuan periods saw a China where “the central state acted merely as tax collector” while landlordism and private violence filled the void . Civil rights for the commoner were minimal in such an order . Thus, the erosion of this early form of labor empowerment can be directly linked to centuries of diminished human rights and weaker state responsibility toward the populace . The Roman Republic: Decline of the Yeoman Farmer and the Fall of Republican Liberty The Roman Republic offers a classic case in which the broad-based power of small independent laborers (the citizen-farmer class) was the bedrock of a freer society – and the erosion of that class led to oligarchy, civil strife, and eventually dictatorship. Early and mid-Republican Rome was characterized by a large population of yeoman farmers : citizen-soldiers who owned modest plots of land (often won in settlement of conquered territories) and whose economic independence underpinned their political rights. These small farmers not only fed the Republic but also made up the ranks of its army and had voting power in popular assemblies (with property qualifications linked to military service). Numerous ancient writers – from Dionysius of Halicarnassus to Livy – lauded the early Republic’s agrarian simplicity and the civic virtue of4 4 89 4 10 11 4 3 its independent farmers . When every citizen had “a stake in the future of his great city” through landownership and the status of a free laborer , Romans believed, the republic was strong and liberty was safeguarded . Indeed, the citizen-soldier ideal was a defining feature of Roman democracy: those who tilled their own fields and served in the legions were stakeholders who could hold leaders accountable, and Rome’s laws (like the Licinian Sextian reforms of 367 BCE) tried to limit the amount of land the elite could monopolize, to preserve this class . However , following Rome’s rapid imperial expansion in the 2nd century BCE (after the Punic Wars and conquests in the East), this equilibrium began to break down. Massive influxes of wealth and slaves flowed into Italy, and the elite aristocratic senators leveraged their new riches to acquire huge swaths of land. The small farmers, meanwhile, were pressured on multiple fronts. Prolonged military campaigns kept many away from their farms for years, leading to neglect or ruin of their holdings . As one account describes, veterans of long wars often returned to find their farms in disrepair or even destroyed, forcing them to sell to wealthier neighbors . Even legendary figures like Cincinnatus lamented that being called off to war could mean “my field will go unsown this year” – multiply this by thousands of peasant- soldiers and the impact was enormous. Additionally, cheap slave labor and imported grain from newly conquered provinces (such as Spain, Sicily, and North Africa) undercut the market for Italian free farmers . Large estates ( latifundia ) worked by slaves began producing wine, olive oil, and cash crops at scales and costs smallholders could not match . As a result, many yeomen were economically ruined and forced to sell their plots to rich investors , feeding a cycle of “dislocation and impoverishment” among the once-sturdy middle class . By the late 2nd century BCE, the Italian countryside was increasingly dominated by latifundia – “sprawling estates… [that] made extensive use of slave labor” and grew far larger than the legal limits once intended to protect small farmers . Roman historians like Appian, Plutarch, and Livy uniformly attributed the Republic’s mounting social problems to the rise of these large estates and the corresponding decline of the independent farmer class . The political and social consequences of this shift were dramatic. First, the economic polarization translated into a loss of military and political inclusion for the lower classes. Rome’s legions, traditionally filled by property-owning citizens, found their recruitment base shrinking – “the weakening of the Roman middle class brought on a progressive decline in the number of men qualified to serve in the army” . This led to the military reforms of Marius (107 BCE), who had to allow landless proletarians to enlist, thus transforming the army into a force of professional soldiers loyal more to their generals (who paid and settled them) than to the Republic . That in turn set the stage for power-hungry generals to use the army in civil strife. Equally important, the erosion of the smallholder class undermined the Republican political order . The Roman Republic’s mixed constitution gave substantial weight to wealth (e.g. the Centuriate Assembly was skewed toward propertied classes), but as more land and wealth concentrated in a few noble families, oligarchic control tightened . The dispossessed farmers often drifted to Rome’s cities (especially the capital) where, without property or steady work, they became a restive urban underclass dependent on patronage and the famous annona (grain dole). This mass of impoverished citizens could be manipulated by ambitious politicians through bread and circuses, rather than participating as independent voters. Meanwhile, the noble senatorial class grew ever richer and more entrenched, resisting reforms that might redistribute land or power . The abortive reforms of the Gracchus brothers in 133–121 BCE – which sought to restore land to the landless plebeians – vividly illustrate this conflict. Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus effectively recognized that “the problems of the late Republic [were] due to the growth of these estates” and the impoverishment of Romans . They pushed for land commission and grain laws to bolster common citizens, but the entrenched elite violently opposed them, leading to the assassination of the Gracchi and hundreds of their followers. Violence entered Roman politics on an unprecedented scale at this point1213 14 15 1617 1819 17 2021 2223 2220 2425 1526 2728 15 29 4 . Over the next decades, as private armies loyal to competing aristocrats formed (Marius vs. Sulla, Pompey vs. Caesar , etc.), the Republic spiraled into civil war . Notably, contemporary observers linked the erosion of traditional civic virtue and accountability with the changes in the economic base. Historian Sallust lamented the corruption and “shamelessness, bribery and rapacity” that had overcome Roman politics by the first century BCE, contrasting it with the supposed frugality and shared sacrifice of earlier times . Others like Velleius Paterculus bemoaned the “private luxury” of the new plutocrats and the breakdown of the old “collectivist norms” that once restrained elite greed . In essence, the decline of the small farmer class was seen as both symptom and cause of a moral and political crisis : the Roman aristocracy ceased to view themselves as guardians of the common good, and the common people lost their economic independence that underpinned their political voice . When “the typical Roman placed a high value on his citizenship” and even the lowliest had a stake, there was a check on elite excess . By the late Republic, that check was gone. “The Nazi ban on free trade unions not only deprived workers of collective bargaining and representation, it also removed a bastion of democracy and freedom” , wrote a modern commentator about a much later scenario – but one could similarly say of Rome: the banishment (de facto) of the free citizen-farmer removed a bastion of the Republic’s earlier balance. The result was a slide into authoritarian rule . By 27 BCE, the Republican system had collapsed into the autocracy of Augustus. The Roman people, once fiercely protective of their liberty, had been pacified by bread distributions and spectacle, their political energies spent in factional strife or clientelism. The state, now effectively an empire ruled by an emperor , had little compunction about sacrificing lives for power – whether in endless imperial wars or gladiatorial arenas – since the broad citizen check on ruling power had vanished. In sum, the fall of the Roman Republic underscores how the loss of an empowered laboring citizenry (in this case the independent farmers) paved the way for tyranny . Social historian Monte Pearson observed that as Rome’s agrarian middle class declined, the “old-fashioned corporateness” and community-oriented ethos decayed, giving rise to unchecked individual ambition among elites . The end result – civil wars and Caesarism – vividly demonstrated the catastrophic outcome when economic power and land ownership, and thus political power, concentrated in the hands of a few at the expense of the many. Early-Modern England: Enclosures, Dispossessed Labor, and Repression In England from the late medieval through early modern period , we find another paradigm: the transformation of the rural labor force through the enclosure of common lands and the concurrent suppression of labor rights. During the feudal Middle Ages, English peasants had customary access to common lands for grazing and farming, which, while not “ownership” in the modern sense, did guarantee a measure of economic independence and subsistence. Beginning in the Tudor period (16th century) and accelerating through the 18th century, however , large landowners (often gentry or aristocracy) pushed a sweeping movement of enclosing common lands – that is, legally or extra-legally seizing communal fields, pastures, and wastes to turn them into private, fenced estates typically devoted to more profitable uses like sheep ranching. Enclosure had the effect of evicting vast numbers of peasants and smallholders from their traditional livelihoods. As one historical account notes, “There was a significant rise in enclosure during the Tudor period… The widespread eviction of people from their lands resulted in the collapse of the open field system… The deprivations of the displaced workers [have] been seen by historians as a cause of subsequent social unrest.” . Indeed, throughout the 1500s, popular revolts flared in response to enclosures: for example, Sir Thomas More in Utopia famously critiqued that “sheep are eating men” , referring to how converting farms to sheep pasture for wool displaced human tenants. The 1549 Kett’s Rebellion in Norfolk was a direct reaction to enclosures – thousands of yeoman farmers and landless laborers rose up, tearing down fences and30 3132 3334 3514 14 36 3237 38 5 petitioning the King to redress their loss of commons. Although that rebellion was brutally suppressed, it underscores how intimately linked land/labor power and rights were perceived: the rebels demanded not just economic relief but also an end to corrupt governance by land magnates, articulating a proto- democratic impulse tied to their status as free Englishmen being violated by enclosure. The Tudor authorities, significantly, acknowledged the social danger of enclosure , even if feebly. The Crown passed multiple “anti-enclosure” statutes (the so-called Tillage Acts of 1489, 1515, 1533, etc.) aiming to limit conversion of tillage to pasture and to penalize depopulating villages . These laws were often weakly enforced, since local elites had vested interests in enclosure . Still, the very existence of such legislation shows an awareness that dispossessing laboring people en masse threatened the realm’s stability and military strength . Tudor policymakers warned that enclosure-led evictions were creating “vagabonds and thieves” and “enfeebling the military strength of the state” by depopulating villages . (This mirrors the logic seen in other contexts: just as Chinese emperors feared losing tax and corvée payers to landlord control, English officials feared that landless ex-peasants would become a lawless underclass or would not be available as sturdy soldiers.) Thus, even before industrialization, labor power in the form of secure peasant tenure was linked to national interest . Despite sporadic pushback, enclosure continued and peaked around the 18th and early 19th centuries (with thousands of Parliamentary Enclosure Acts accelerating the process). The result was the creation of a large class of rural proletarians: farmers who once had land or commons were now landless laborers working for wages, or they migrated to towns to seek work – becoming the nascent industrial working class. This transformation was accompanied by harsh legal measures to control the now-destitute workforce . In other words, as labor lost the power that comes with owning or accessing land, the state moved not to empower them in new ways, but to regiment and discipline them , often treating the poor as a threat. For instance, the Tudor and Stuart eras saw the institution of severe vagrancy laws . Able-bodied people found wandering without work or obvious support could be whipped, branded, or even enslaved for a time – a draconian approach to the “sturdy beggars” problem that enclosure had contributed to. The Poor Laws similarly were reformed over time (culminating in the New Poor Law of 1834) to make relief as unattractive as possible (the notorious workhouses), essentially coercing the poor to accept whatever wages and conditions the market offered. This reflects a devaluation of human life : rather than seeing the unemployed or landless as citizens to be helped, they were often seen as a nuisance or criminal element to be controlled. Most tellingly, the early period of English industrialization – roughly late 18th to early 19th century – involved direct repression of labor’s collective attempts to improve conditions . The Combination Acts of 1799 and 1800 explicitly made trade unionism and collective bargaining illegal in Britain , under penalty of imprisonment or hard labor . These Acts were passed by a Parliament fearful that organized workers might follow the path of the French Revolution; they criminalized any “combination” of workingmen seeking wage increases or shorter hours, and even forbade workers from simply refusing to work with non-union labor . As Britannica summarizes, “the laws… sentenced to three months in jail or two months’ hard labour any workingman who combined with another to gain an increase in wages or decrease in hours… The sentence was to be imposed by two magistrates, and appeal was made extremely difficult.” . Defendants could be forced to testify against each other and even supporters who paid a fined worker’s expenses could be fined themselves . Meanwhile, although the Acts in theory also banned employers’ combinations, those provisions were never enforced – a clear indication that the state’s goal was to crush worker coordination, not employer collusion. This era also witnessed events like the Peterloo Massacre of 1819 , where cavalry charged a peaceful demonstration of tens of thousands of workers in Manchester who were3940 41 4243 44 44 44 44 45 6 rallying for parliamentary reform and relief from poverty; over a dozen were killed and hundreds injured. The name “Peterloo” bitterly alluded to Waterloo, indicating protesters saw themselves as victims of a domestic military onslaught. Such incidents underscore that ruling authorities placed property and order above the lives of laborers , meeting calls for basic rights with armed force. Only later , under public pressure and fear of unrest, did Britain relax some of these measures – the Combination Acts were repealed in 1824 (leading to a surge of strikes) , though heavily qualified by new restrictions in 1825 . Yet even after unions became legal, the treatment of worker organizers could be brutal: a famous example is the case of the Tolpuddle Martyrs in 1834. Six agricultural laborers in Dorset tried to form a friendly society (a prototypical union) to protest starvation wages. Even though unions were nominally legal, local authorities used an old law against “unlawful oaths” to prosecute them for swearing a secret loyalty oath – a technicality used to break the nascent union . The Tolpuddle men were sentenced to seven years’ transportation to Australia (penal labor in the colonies), the maximum punishment, effectively for the “crime” of organizing workers . The judge openly said they were being made an example of, claiming “the safety of the country was at stake” . This extraordinarily harsh sentence (tantamount to exiling them to a fate from which many never returned) provoked a public outcry in Britain; large demonstrations and petitions eventually pressured the government to pardon and repatriate the men by 1837 . The Tolpuddle case is emblematic: without labor power (these men had virtually none aside from their unity), the state initially had no compunction about destroying their lives to deter others . As one commentary on the case notes, “their real crime in the eyes of the establishment was to have formed a trade union to protest their meagre pay” . Only broad public solidarity saved them – a nascent sign of labor’s growing collective influence, which in time would force further reforms. But the initial reaction of authorities reveals how little the lives and rights of humble laborers were valued when they challenged the status quo : in the eyes of the 1830s British ruling class, these farm workers were expendable in service of “order .” In the broader scope, post-enclosure England saw rising inequality and political exclusion . While the late 18th and 19th centuries did bring about parliamentary reforms, these were often slow and came after significant unrest (the Chartist movement of the 1830s–40s, for example, was driven by the working classes’ demand for voting rights and was met initially with repression). The Great Reform Act of 1832 extended the franchise only to the urban middle classes, still excluding most workers. Not until 1867 and 1884 were many workers enfranchised. Thus for a long period, the majority of laborers had no political voice , and the ruling elite (landed aristocracy and industrial capitalists) governed in their own interest, often at dire cost to the working poor . Industrial cities in the early 1800s abounded with misery – low wages, dangerous conditions, child labor – and when workers tried to better these conditions, they encountered either legal barriers or outright force. In sum, the enclosure movement’s destruction of the independent English peasantry created a mass of dependent laborers who, lacking power, suffered both economically and civically . As one historian put it, UBI (Universal Basic Income) proposals today sometimes arise in contexts of retreat, as a “bioindicator” of neoliberalism’s progress – support for basic incomes proliferates where neoliberal reforms have been most devastating . Analogously, the early 19th-century push for cooperative movements, friendly societies, and eventually unions was an indicator of how devastating enclosure and laissez-faire capitalism had been to worker well-being. But until those movements gained traction, the State’s response to labor’s weakness was not benevolence but exploitation and control . In early- modern England, therefore, we clearly see that when labor lost its traditional power (land rights, guild protections, etc.), there was a concurrent erosion of rights and an increase in state or elite violence toward laborers . Only the later rise of labor organization began to check this trend (for instance, by the46 47 4849 50 51 52 53 54 7 late 19th century, trade unions and a labor-friendly political ideology forced more democratic concessions and social reforms). Imperial Russia: Serfdom, Emancipation, and Autocracy’s Grip on Labor Imperial Russia before the 20th century presents a stark example of labor power (or its absence) shaping an entire social order . For much of Russia’s history, the majority of its laboring population were serfs – essentially unfree peasants tied to the land and owned or controlled by noble landlords (or the state in the case of state peasants). By the 18th–19th centuries, Russian serfdom had evolved into a deeply oppressive system often compared to slavery in its restrictions. Prior to the great emancipation of 1861, roughly one- third to one-half of Russian peasants were enserfed to the nobility , owing labor (or rent in goods) that typically consumed around half of their output for the lord’s benefit . They could not legally leave the land without permission, their movement was controlled, and they were subject to their landlords’ private justice. The remaining peasants were mostly “state peasants,” who belonged to the Tsar’s domains and paid dues to the state; they had somewhat lighter obligations but still faced movement restrictions . In both cases, the vast mass of Russian labor had effectively zero independent power or rights : serfs had no right to property (their plots were allocated by their lord), no right to marry or travel without approval, and no political voice. The autocratic Tsarist state explicitly buttressed this hierarchy. As one analysis notes, from Peter the Great onward, Russia was a “centralized autocracy combining aspects of modern administration with archaic forms of exploitation” , where state functions like the military were sustained by *“extract[ing] necessary resources from the peasantry via the nobility.” . The nobility served as the backbone of imperial administration and military leadership, and in exchange they were given nearly absolute power over the serfs on their estates. This arrangement had several pernicious effects on civil rights and the value of life. First , it practically eliminated the notion of inherent rights for a huge swath of the population. A serf’s status was that of property; while not chattel that could be traded independently of land, serfs could be sold with estates and were subject to corporal punishment or exile at their master’s whim. The state’s legal code (the Ulozhenie of 1649 and later statutes) formalized serfs’ lack of personhood in many respects. For example, serf families could be broken up by sale, and while murder of a serf by a noble might technically be illegal, enforcement was rare and nobles were rarely punished severely for mistreating their peasants. The Tsarist regime’s attitude toward peasant life is exemplified by the system of military conscription in the 18th century: instead of an all-class draft, the government levied recruits almost solely from peasant households (nobles were exempt from conscription). These peasant conscripts were taken for 25-year service terms – effectively a life sentence – and their communities were collectively responsible for delivering a quota of young men to the army . Once conscripted, a peasant was dead to their village (often a mock funeral was held), and their survival in the army was of little concern to the state. This indicates how utterly subordinate individual human lives (of the lower class) were to the state’s and nobility’s needs . The Russian army grew huge on this coercive basis – by the late 18th century it was the largest in Europe – but it was sustained by what one commentator calls “coercion and exploitation [that] did little to promote the welfare of the peasantry” . Peasants were fodder for the military machine and for the nobles’ estates, and their well-being was secondary. During wars (such as the Crimean War in 1853–56), this disregard had disastrous results: the Russian army’s peasant-soldiers died in droves, often from disease and starvation, as an underdeveloped state infrastructure failed to supply or care for them . In the Crimea, “approximately 450,000 [Russians] died, mostly from preventable diseases exacerbated by inadequate food and medical care” – a stark figure that underscores how cheaply the regime valued its serf-soldiers’ lives.5556 5758 59 6061 62 6364 65 6667 66 67 8 Second , the lack of labor power in Russia (serfs had no legal organizations, no voice) enabled the state to maintain a rigid autocracy with minimal accountability. There was no peasant parliament or genuine consultation; Russia remained an absolute monarchy until 1905 in part because the Tsars could rely on the nobles (and a feared secret police/censorship apparatus) to keep the masses in check. The peasants’ occasional revolts – such as the massive Pugachev’s Rebellion of 1773–75 – were brutally crushed, and rather than prompting reforms, often led to even harsher repression to prevent future uprisings. Pugachev’s rebellion (which rallied serfs with the promise of land and freedom) terrified Catherine the Great into abandoning any thought of liberalizing serfdom; instead she granted nobles even greater control over serfs as a means to secure loyalty. This cycle demonstrated that the state’s response to labor unrest, absent any recognized labor rights, was terror and crackdown rather than concession. It was not until 1861 that Tsar Alexander II, spurred by military failures and fear of future revolts, emancipated the serfs . The Emancipation Edict nominally gave some 23 million private serfs “the full rights of free citizens” – e.g. to marry without consent, to own property, and to run businesses – and later extended to state serfs as well . This was a monumental social change on paper . However , the manner in which emancipation was implemented crucially determined whether labor gained meaningful power or remained essentially oppressed. To appease the nobility, the reform forced peasants to pay large “redemption payments” for the land they were ostensibly granted. The government compensated landowners for land lost by raising a loan that the peasants had to repay over 49 years, with interest – effectively saddling the ex-serfs with a huge mortgage to buy parcels of the same soil they and their ancestors had worked for generations . The land allotments were often insufficient and overpriced. As noted, “the land was overvalued… landlords could game the system to obtain higher valuations… meaning peasants’ interest on the debt could be greater than the income from their land” . Many peasants thus started their “freedom” in deep poverty and debt. Moreover , to maintain rural order , the Tsarist regime restructured local governance around the peasant commune (mir) , which was collectively responsible for tax payments and redemption dues. While the mir gave peasants a say in local matters and pooled resources, it also meant that individual peasants still had limited freedom of movement – the commune could prevent members from leaving until debts were paid, for instance – and traditional village hierarchies often persisted. In 1881, when redemption payments were finally made compulsory for all remaining “temporarily obligated” peasants, and later when the government cut the payments by 13% amid widespread tax arrears and peasant unrest , it was a tacit admission that the burdens were too great. Indeed, historical data shows the crushing weight of these payments led to numerous peasant uprisings in the 1860s–70s and contributed to the revolutionary atmosphere by the turn of the century . One source notes, “The redemption tax was so high that the serfs had to sell all the grain they produced to pay the tax, leaving nothing for their survival. … This led to civil unrest.” . In other words, the newly “freed” labor force was still largely powerless and impoverished , and the state’s policies continued to value fiscal extraction over peasant lives, pushing many to the brink of starvation to meet obligations. In the late 19th century, seeing that peasant unrest and backward agriculture threatened stability, some Tsarist officials (like Prime Minister Stolypin) attempted reforms to strengthen peasants economically (e.g. allowing enterprising peasants to break from the commune and consolidate private farms). But these efforts were limited and came late. By the early 20th century, the accumulated grievances of the peasantry (along with a new urban industrial working class’s discontent) led to the Revolution of 1905 , during which peasants burned manor houses and workers struck. In response, Tsar Nicholas II was forced to concede a parliament (Duma) and some civil liberties. Tellingly, one of the key pushes for reform was that without some voice or relief, the empire was ungovernable – a recognition that totally silencing labor was no longer viable. However , the First and Second Dumas (1906–07) included many peasant representatives who6869 7071 7273 7475 76 76 9 pressed for land redistribution, which the Tsar and conservatives found unacceptable. The regime dissolved these Dumas and changed the electoral law to stack it with landowners and the bourgeoisie, marginalizing peasant and worker voices again. This bad-faith “constitutionalism” showed that the autocracy still fundamentally did not respect labor as an equal stakeholder . Ultimately, in 1917, revolution (first February’s liberal revolution, then October’s Bolshevik revolution) toppled Tsarism – fueled largely by demands of “Peace, Land, and Bread,” essentially calls for ending the elite’s wars, giving land to those who till it, and feeding the urban workers. In short, Russia’s history demonstrates that denying labor power and rights can hold an autocratic system together for a time, but at immense human cost and with a risk of eventual violent upheaval . Until that breaking point, millions of lives were ground down – whether under the lash of serfdom or the yoke of redemption debt – with the state apparatus treating those lives instrumentally. For example, during the Great Famine of 1891–92, the government’s slow response (partly due to ideological reluctance to admit a crisis) resulted in perhaps 400,000 deaths; some scholars argue the regime’s indifference to peasant suffering in this famine further delegitimized it. Again, an empowered laboring class might have forced more accountable governance that could have mitigated such disasters, but in Tsarist Russia the peasantry had no such leverage for most of its history. In sum, Imperial Russia illustrates the extreme case of labor without power and the ensuing political despotism . Serfdom left laborers with virtually no rights; emancipation, while a step forward, was structured in a way that left peasants impoverished and still largely voiceless, which in turn perpetuated undemocratic rule and social turmoil. Only when labor in Russia did begin to organize (peasants seizing land in 1917, industrial workers forming soviets) was the old order swept aside – albeit replaced by another authoritarian system eventually. The lesson remains: a state that does not rely on the consent or bargaining power of its laboring population (whether because it can coerce them or dispense patronage from other revenues) tends to deprive that population of basic rights and treat them as expendable . In political- science terms, Tsarist Russia was akin to a “rentier state” internally – the Tsar extracted resources via nobles from a disenfranchised class and thus felt no need for representation. This aligns with the theory that “rentier states need not tax their citizens, thus breaking a crucial link between citizens and their governments and dimming the prospects for democracy.” . Imperial Russia’s labor setup indeed broke the link between the mass of people and power , with predictably undemocratic results. Fascist and Authoritarian Regimes: Suppressing Labor to Dismantle Democracy Moving to the 20th century, one striking pattern is how authoritarian regimes, especially of the fascist variety in Europe, systematically crushed independent labor organizations as one of their first and foundational actions , thus removing a major check on their totalitarian ambitions. The experiences of Italy under Mussolini and Germany under Hitler are particularly instructive. In both cases, nascent or established democracies were subverted by movements that, upon gaining power , immediately targeted trade unions, free workers’ parties, and strikes for elimination. This was not incidental: fascist ideology was explicitly anti-socialist and anti-labor in the sense of opposing any autonomous worker power base. The result was regimes where workers lost all collective rights, and the state and industrial elites dictated terms – with dire consequences for civil and human rights. In Italy , Benito Mussolini’s Fascist Party rose to power in the early 1920s amid social upheaval (the Biennio Rosso of 1919–20 had featured intense labor strikes and factory occupations in Italy). The fascists were financed and supported by industrialists and landowners anxious to crush socialist-led labor agitation. Upon consolidating power (by 1925, after the Matteotti crisis), Mussolini wasted no time in banning free trade unions and replacing them with state-controlled fascist syndicates. As one economic history notes: “A77 10 former revolutionary trade unionist, Mussolini banned free trade unions in 1925, replacing them with Fascist trade unions under the authority of the National Fascist Party. The state imposed artificial cooperation between employers and employees within ‘guilds’… supposed to represent the nation’s economic interests. In reality, these structures served above all to neutralize workers’ demands.” . This was codified in the Labour Charter of 1927 , which explicitly subordinated individual rights to the interests of the Fascist state. The Charter declared “work was a social duty, and that individual rights had to take a back seat to those of the State.” . The regime touted that it had “pacified” labor relations – but, as noted, this was achieved “largely by eliminating the possibility of protest” . Strikes were outlawed; independent worker activism was punishable by imprisonment or worse. In new “Corporative” tribunals, any labor disputes were settled by Fascist officials, almost invariably in favor of the employer or “national interest.” Thus, Italian workers in the Fascist era lost the right to strike, bargain, or even gather independently , and were instead enrolled in compulsory state unions that enforced discipline. This allowed Mussolini to claim class conflict was over – but really it meant class conflict was forcibly one-sided, with the state as arbiter always favoring capital and its own authority. Indeed, by “eliminating the possibility of protest,” the regime freed itself to pursue economic experiments (like wage cuts to boost exports, as happened in the “Battle of the Lira”) without serious opposition . When wages were slashed to maintain an overvalued currency in 1927, workers had no recourse; poverty increased, but strikes did not occur because they would be met with imprisonment. The devaluation of human life under Italian Fascism became most evident in its militarism and imperialism – sending conscripted workers to fight colonial wars in Ethiopia and a disastrous campaign alongside Nazi Germany later . Italy’s impoverished peasants and workers were treated as grist for Mussolini’s ambitions, with the state propaganda exhorting them to sacrifice for the nation while denying them any say. Only with the fall of the regime in WWII did free unions re-emerge in Italy; tellingly, postwar Italy’s constitution guarantees the right to organize, reflecting learned lessons from the fascist suppression. In Nazi Germany , the pattern was if anything even more ruthless. The Weimar Republic of the 1920s had a vibrant labor movement – powerful trade unions and a political wing (the Social Democratic and Communist parties) that represented workers’ interests. These were among the first targets when Hitler took power in 1933 . On May 2, 1933, barely a day after orchestrating a state-sponsored “May Day” celebration to lull unionists, the Nazis raided and destroyed all free trade union offices across Germany. The leaders of the unions were arrested, beaten, and often sent to concentration camps; union funds were confiscated . In their place, Hitler’s regime established the German Labor Front (Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) – a gigantic compulsory organization that all workers and employers had to join, which was not a union in any protective sense but an instrument of Nazi control. As the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust recounts, “Following a major celebration of May Day, all trade unions were closed down, their headquarters and records seized, and their leaders attacked and imprisoned. German workers were forced to join a German Labour Front which controlled deductions for taxation and the ‘Strength through Joy’ program…” . The DAF aimed to depoliticize workers by offering some leisure activities (the “Strength through Joy” program provided subsidized holidays and events) but fundamentally it stripped workers of any bargaining power . Wages, hours, and conditions were dictated by the state or compliant employers; any dissent was considered “sabotage” or treason. The right to strike was abolished , and labor courts were staffed by Nazi officials. In essence, by summer 1933, the German working class had been muzzled. This had immediate political implications: as the Trades Union Congress (TUC) of Britain later observed , the crushing of unions “removed a bastion of democracy and freedom that stood in the way of the Nazis’ total control over German society” . The unions in Weimar had not just fought for wages; they were one of the strongest pro- democratic civil society institutions. Their destruction allowed the Nazis to proceed unchecked in eliminating all opposition and implementing terror . Indeed, many union leaders were also leaders in the7879 80 8081 82 83 84 8385 3686 11 Social Democratic Party, which was banned; their removal silenced a key segment of society that might have resisted later Nazi policies. The Nazi regime openly recognized this function: early propaganda boasted of overcoming “Marxism” and class struggle, uniting the nation – which in practice meant that workers no longer had any platform to voice grievances . As a result, when the Nazi state later mobilized for war and genocide, there was no independent labor voice to protest, no strikes against militarization or the use of forced labor , etc. On the contrary, German industrialists and the Nazi state were able to exploit labor to an extreme degree – including the use of millions of foreign forced laborers and concentration camp prisoners – to fuel the war machine. The average German worker , while not enslaved, saw real wages drop and working hours increase without compensation under Nazi rule, but had no legal avenue to resist. Dissent in the workplace or attempts to organize were met by the Gestapo. The devaluation of human life reached its zenith in the Holocaust and other atrocities, and while those targeted specific ethnic/racial groups, it’s notable that among the early victims of Nazi persecution were trade unionists themselves , who were imprisoned and in some cases killed (the TUC notes that “many trade union leaders were arrested, some were tortured, and some did not survive imprisonment” ). The link between labor suppression and wider human rights abuses is direct in the Nazi case: by breaking organized labor – one of the last institutions capable of collective action – the Nazi government smoothed the path to implement policies that trampled on human rights on an unfathomable scale. As TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak reflected in 2023, “By banning free trade unions, the Nazis were removing potential organised opposition. And this was instrumental in enabling murder on a scale never seen before.” . This is a powerful endorsement of the idea that labor power (and its absence) can make or break democracy : free unions are described as “strongholds of free association” and a bulwark against extremism , and history bore that out in Weimar/Nazi Germany. Other authoritarian regimes show similar patterns. In Franco’s Spain (1939–1975) , independent unions were banned (replaced by the corporatist Sindicato Vertical ), and labor activists were persecuted, with some executed or imprisoned, especially in early years. In apartheid South Africa , as we will examine next, black labor was systematically denied rights. In many Latin American dictatorships of the 20th century (Chile 1973–89, Argentina 1976–83, etc.), one of the first moves was to outlaw or severely restrict unions, arrest union leaders, and impose state-controlled wage setting – all part of what they termed “stabilization,” but which really removed organized labor as a democratic actor . This often went hand in hand with neoliberal economic policies beneficial to elites and foreign investors, implemented under coercion. Thousands of trade unionists in Latin America were “disappeared” or killed by right-wing regimes and paramilitaries. For instance, in Colombia over the late 20th century, hundreds of unionists were assassinated – something noted in the TUC piece as well, “Colombia has long been one of the most dangerous countries in the world to be a trade unionist. Thousands have been murdered by extreme right-wing paramilitaries, while far-right governments crushed democratic working-class self-organisation.” . The TUC author explicitly links such violence to broader oppression, pointing out that “the same paramilitaries and governments have murdered indigenous people and Afro-Colombians too” – in other words, regimes that target unions often target minority rights and dissent in general. The pattern is consistent globally: wherever democratic freedoms erode, labor rights are among the first to be attacked, and conversely, where labor is kept powerless, full democracy struggles to take root . Modern studies bear this out: the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) documents how in dozens of countries, union organizers face violence and even murder , calling it a “barometer of democracy.” In 2021 alone, trade unionists were murdered in 13 countries and workers faced violent suppression in 50 countries – a grim statistic that shows how many governments still perceive independent labor as a threat to be eliminated, at terrible human cost.87 8889 90 9192 93 94 12 Apartheid South Africa: Racial Exploitation and the Absence of Labor Rights Apartheid South Africa (1948–1994) provides a particularly poignant example of how denying labor power – in this case along racial lines – buttressed an oppressive regime that grossly devalued human life and rights. Under apartheid, the black majority (and other communities of color) were systematically disenfranchised and exploited as a cheap labor force for white-owned mines, farms, and industries. The entire socio-economic system was designed to extract labor from blacks while according them no political representation or basic rights. “In Apartheid South Africa, the right to belong to a trade union was denied to Black people. Trade unions were reserved for White workers,” notes one firsthand account . This meant that for decades, black workers had no legal means to collectively bargain or strike ; any attempt to form black unions was illegal and often met with swift repression by police. White workers, by contrast, not only had unions but were privileged by a color bar that protected their jobs and wages. Black labor was the foundation of sectors like gold and diamond mining, but these workers were treated as a permanent underclass – they were often migrant laborers corralled in all-male hostels, working in dangerous conditions for meager pay, and subjected to pass laws that controlled their movement (failure to produce a work pass could result in arrest or forced relocation). This scenario ensured that black labor had virtually no power : if an individual protested or became “troublesome,” they could be summarily dismissed and deported to a rural “homeland” as an unemployed surplus person, thanks to the racially discriminatory laws. The result was predictably brutal. Working conditions, especially in mining, were horrific and deadly . Because black workers could not effectively organize for safety improvements or higher wages, mining companies and the state had little incentive to invest in better conditions. Mines became, as one South African labor activist later described, “killing fields for [black] workers denied the protection of health and safety legislation” . Indeed, apartheid’s racially skewed labor laws excluded black workers from many protections that white workers had. Thousands died in mine accidents over the years, and far more from occupational diseases like silicosis, yet there was minimal accountability. The “cheap labor” policy explicitly valued profit over black lives – if one miner died, another could be recruited from the reserves (the impoverished rural areas where black families were forced to reside). The government’s lack of concern for black workers’ well-being was evident in events like the 1960 Sharpeville Massacre , when police opened fire on a crowd protesting the pass laws (many of them workers sick of arbitrary arrests for pass infractions), killing 69 people. Again in 1973, when black workers in Durban undertook mass wildcat strikes for better wages (one of the first large-scale industrial actions by black labor since the 1940s), the state initially cracked down, though the sheer scale forced some concessions and was a turning point that led to the growth of new black unions in the 1970s. The denial of labor rights under apartheid was intimately connected to the denial of all other civil rights for the majority . Since black South Africans could not vote or hold office, and could not strike or bargain, they had no peaceful means to influence policies affecting them. This fueled a cycle of repression and resistance: worker grievances fed into the larger anti-apartheid struggle, often via community- organized protests that were met with state violence. For decades, the apartheid regime attempted to silence labor-related dissent through bannings, imprisonments, and violence . For example, leaders of the 1970s black labor movement (like those in the newly formed unions in 1979–80) were harassed or detained under security laws. One notable case was the 1982 execution of Wellington Tshazibane , a trade unionist charged under “terrorism” statutes; and in 1988 the state effectively banned the largest black trade union federation (COSATU) by imposing a state of emergency and targeting its leaders. Such repression further demonstrates how the state viewed empowered black labor as an existential threat to9596 9798 13 apartheid , because it was. When black workers finally did unionize in large numbers in the 1980s (COSATU was founded in 1985), their strikes and boycotts became a powerful force aligned with political movements (like the United Democratic Front and ANC). The apartheid regime’s attempts to crush these actions – e.g. violently breaking strikes, assassinating organizers – only underscored the moral bankruptcy of a system that valued racial hierarchy and capital over human lives . Many union activists were among those killed by apartheid security forces. But the growth of labor power among the oppressed proved decisive: by making the country ungovernable through stay-aways and international solidarity actions (such as when black workers refused to handle goods bound for apartheid or , famously, the 1986 strike where black South African workers protested in solidarity with American unionists ), they hastened apartheid’s end. In the new South Africa after 1994, the role of labor in achieving democracy was explicitly recognized – COSATU became part of the governing alliance, and labor rights (including the right to unionize and strike) were enshrined in the constitution. The contrast is telling: under apartheid, the combination of racial oppression and labor exploitation represented a nearly total denial of human dignity for the majority ; under democracy, restoring labor rights was seen as restoring humanity and citizenship to those people. Glen Mpufane, a South African mine worker-turned-unionist, reflected that under apartheid, black workers were “denied dignity as workers with fundamental rights” and that the mines were “bastions of apartheid” where the white bosses were literal “masters” and blacks were forced to speak Afrikaans and obey . He notes that once trade unions were finally recognized, they quickly became “a strong force in bringing down the apartheid regime” . After recognition and through relentless struggle, black unions achieved improvements: “South Africa became one of the best mining countries in the world – for workers. Conditions improved in health and safety, respect for workers’ rights, housing, education…” . This dramatic turnaround underscores the report’s broader thesis: when labor gains power and voice, broader social justice follows; when labor is kept powerless, oppression reigns . Apartheid South Africa may be an extreme case, but it drives home the point that the decline or denial of labor power correlates with the grossest violations of civil and human rights . Under apartheid, black lives were explicitly deemed inferior and expendable, and the removal of labor rights was both a cause and effect of that dehumanization. Synthesis of Historical Cases From these historical explorations – spanning ancient agrarian societies to modern industrial nations – a clear pattern emerges. Labor power and democracy/civil rights have been mutually reinforcing : in times and places where labor (peasants, workers) could independently sustain themselves or organize, authority was forced to negotiate or show a degree of accountability, and social values tended to include notions of rights or citizen dignity. Conversely, when labor became completely dependent, disorganized, or was forcibly suppressed, elites or the state often slid into authoritarian rule, no longer tempered by a need to earn the populace’s consent. The devaluation of human life often followed, whether in the form of increased tolerance for poverty, harsh punishments, or mass violence. The Roman Republic’s collapse into empire, the Tang Dynasty’s drift into feudal warlordism, early-modern England’s brutal treatment of the laboring poor , Tsarist Russia’s endurance of slavery-like serfdom, fascist regimes’ terror , and apartheid’s racial oligarchy all exemplify how the erosion of labor’s collective power base (land, rights to organize, etc.) prefaced a broader erosion of human rights and democratic norms . One can also perceive a subtler point: labor power often serves as the backbone of what might be called the “civic infrastructure” of society . In many of these cases, labor organization (be it guilds, unions, village councils, etc.) constituted a major form of civic association. When those were destroyed or99 100 101 102 103 104 105 14 co-opted, society lost a vital mechanism for mediating grievances and channeling popular will. For instance, medieval craft guilds and early trade unions in Europe were not democratic in the modern sense, but they provided workers a say in economic life; abolishing them (as was done by decree in the French Revolution’s aftermath and similarly under Napoleon, and by extension in places like 19th-century Latin America or Asia under colonial influence) left workers atomized, making political oligarchy easier . Similarly, the communal structures in China gave peasants some collective voice at local levels; once landlords took over , that voice was gone until new uprisings created new structures. In sum, history strongly validates the hypothesis that declining labor power is “politically and socially catastrophic.” It creates conditions for extreme inequality and exploitation, and often triggers instability (riots, rebellions, or authoritarian crackdowns – or both). On the other hand, societies that broaden labor power (through reforms or revolution) have often simultaneously broadened civic rights. The next sections of this report will examine how these lessons apply today: how labor power is demonstrably declining in many advanced economies and what that portends, and why proposals to simply replace labor’s role with top-down redistribution are unlikely to succeed without structural changes akin to those that historically empowered working people. The Present Decline of Labor Power in Advanced Economies Having established the historical stakes – that labor power and healthy democratic-social outcomes go hand in hand – we turn now to the present era, especially in advanced post-industrial economies (like the United States, Western Europe, Japan, etc.). A broad consensus of data shows that over roughly the last four decades, labor’s position in these economies has weakened significantly . This can be seen through multiple indicators: union membership rates have plummeted , labor’s share of national income has fallen , and workers’ wage growth has decoupled from productivity growth . Additionally, various legal and structural changes – from the rise of “gig” work to globalization pressures – have made it more difficult for workers to organize or bargain collectively. In effect, even as many of these countries remain formal democracies, the balance of power between labor and capital has shifted substantially in favor of the latter since the late 20th century. The implications are far-reaching: rising economic inequality, a tilt in political influence towards the wealthy, and a sense of disillusionment and alienation among working populations. Numerous analysts now link these trends to phenomena like the rise of populist politics, declining trust in institutions, and fraying social cohesion – all signs of stress on democratic accountability. In this section, we document the evidence of labor’s decline in the present and draw connections to the attendant social and political consequences already observable. Erosion of Unions and Collective Bargaining Union density – the percentage of workers belonging to a labor union – is a key measure of labor’s collective power . In much of the advanced world, union density has seen a marked decline since the late 20th century. For example, in the United States , union membership peaked around mid-century (in the 1950s, over 30% of workers were unionized) and remained around 20% in 1983, but has since fallen to just about 10% in 2023 . According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “the share of U.S. workers who belonged to a union in 2023 stood at 10%, down from 20.1% in 1983” . In the private sector , the numbers are even more striking – only about 6% of private-sector workers in the U.S. are union members today . This is the lowest since records began; in fact, 2022 saw the unionization rate hit its lowest point on record (10.1%) . Other rich democracies have also seen declines, though not uniformly as steep as the U.S. In the United Kingdom , union density dropped from around 40–50% in late 1970s to about 23%106 107 108 109 110 15 by 2021. Germany’s unions covered roughly 30% of workers in 1990 but only about 17% today. Even traditionally high-density countries like Australia and Japan have seen reductions. On the other hand, some nations (notably in Scandinavia) maintain high unionization – e.g. Sweden, Denmark have around 60-70% – but even there, slight downward trends are noted compared to earlier peaks. Importantly, these declines are not merely reflections of changes in the economy (like shift from manufacturing to services) – they also result from deliberate policy choices and employer strategies that have impeded collective bargaining . For instance, in the U.S., one major factor has been the spread of “Right to Work” laws in many states, which prohibit union security agreements (so workers can benefit from union contracts without joining or paying dues, undermining union funding). These laws, heavily promoted since the 1940s and expanding in recent decades, correlate with lower union presence. As an Atlantic Council analysis points out, the U.S. has “among the lowest unionization rates of advanced economies due to specific policy choices” , citing “‘Right to Work’ laws in many states, worker classification rules, and changes to the National Labor Relations Board’s authority” – all of which have “weakened workers’ bargaining power.”* . Additionally, weak enforcement of existing labor protections in the U.S. means employers often face minimal penalties for union-busting or labor law violations . The result is a one-sided ability for employers to resist unions. A Pew Research analysis found that about half of non-union U.S. workers say they would join a union if they could, indicating an unmet desire for collective representation; yet new union elections are few and success rates are low, partly because of intensive employer opposition tactics** (legal and illegal) and a legal framework that has grown less supportive of organizing. In many European countries, union membership decline has been offset somewhat by systems of centralized bargaining or “social partnership” where even non-union workers are covered by collectively negotiated agreements. However , there too, collective bargaining coverage has dropped as laws or norms have changed. For example, United Kingdom in the 1980s under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher introduced a raft of anti-union laws (banning secondary strikes, requiring onerous balloting procedures for strikes, ending the closed shop, etc.) that permanently weakened British unions. The devastating defeat of the National Union of Mineworkers in the 1984–85 miners’ strike was a symbolic and practical blow – after which union influence in the UK waned significantly. New Zealand in 1991 passed the Employment Contracts Act, essentially dismantling national awards and reducing collective bargaining to the enterprise level – union density there fell by half within a few years. These cases show that legal-institutional changes can rapidly accelerate labor’s decline . The consequences of declining unionization are multifaceted. Unions historically have been a vehicle for higher wages, better working conditions, and political representation for working-class people. As they recede, there is evidence of a concurrent rise in income inequality and a tilt in the distribution of economic gains upward . A National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) study referenced by the Atlantic Council piece suggests the decline of unions has been a “major factor” in macroeconomic trends like decreased labor share and increased inequality . Indeed, between 1979 and 2017, declining unionization is estimated to explain 10–20% of the rise in wage inequality in the U.S. . Beyond economics, unions also have social and political effects: studies have found that higher union density correlates with higher voter turnout among workers, more egalitarian political policies, and a counterweight to corporate lobbying in legislatures. As unions weaken, the political influence of wealthy interests grows . This has been evidenced in the U.S. by policy outcomes (tax cuts for the rich, deregulation) that majorities of voters may not favor but that face less opposition in the policymaking process without111 112 113 114 115 116 16 strong labor lobbying. The upshot is that the decline of unions corresponds with a decline in the political power of working-class citizens , which is a perilous sign for democratic equality. To underline this point, consider the observation from the 90th anniversary of the Nazi union ban we cited earlier: “Organised labour continues to be one of the strongest defences against political extremism. Unions are strongholds of free association… Without unions, it is easier for authoritarian governments to undermine citizens’ fundamental rights.” . In the modern context, one can see how in countries where unions are marginal, frustrations of workers may either remain unvoiced or be channeled by demagogues who scapegoat others (immigrants, minorities) instead of negotiating economic improvements. Some political scientists argue that the erosion of unions in the U.S. and UK contributed to the rise of right-wing populism (e.g., Trumpism, Brexit) because those movements filled a void of representing disaffected workers – albeit often while directing anger away from economic elites. In contrast, where unions remain stronger (say, in Scandinavia or Germany to a degree), right-wing populism has been somewhat more contained and social safety nets more robust. The Falling Labor Share of Income and Wage-Productivity Decoupling Another critical indicator of labor’s declining power is the labor share of national income – essentially, the proportion of GDP that is paid out as wages, salaries, and other compensation to workers (as opposed to capital income like profits, dividends, rent, etc.). For many decades in the mid-20th century, economists noted that labor’s share in mature economies was relatively stable (around 60-70% in many cases). However , since the 1980s, a significant downward trend in labor share has been documented in many countries. A McKinsey Global Institute analysis found that across 35 advanced economies, “the labor share of income fell from around 54 percent in 1980 to 50.5 percent in 2014.” . While a drop of roughly 3.5 percentage points may not sound huge, in large economies it represents hundreds of billions of dollars annually shifted away from workers to capital owners . In the United States specifically, the decline has been even sharper in recent years: official BLS data show that between 2000 and 2016, the U.S. labor share (in the non- farm business sector) fell from ~63% to ~57% . The McKinsey report noted that “three-fourths of the entire post-1947 decline [in U.S. labor share] occurred between 2000 and 2016” , which is striking . Similarly, other research (such as by the IMF and academic economists) finds that labor share declines are widespread : one study of 29 large countries (accounting for two-thirds of world GDP) found labor share dropped in 26 of them between 1970 and 2014 . This secular decline in labor’s portion of income is a quantitative reflection of labor’s reduced bargaining power . It implies that even as economies grew, workers captured a smaller slice of that growth, with capital owners taking more. Parallel to this is the phenomenon known as “wage-productivity decoupling.” In the golden age of mid-20th-century growth (circa 1945-1973), worker pay and productivity rose in tandem in many advanced economies. In the U.S., for instance, from 1948 to the late 1970s, productivity (output per hour) roughly doubled and so did inflation-adjusted median wages – delivering broad-based improvements in living standards. However , since about 1979 , a gap opened up. Productivity kept rising at a moderate pace, but median wages stagnated or grew much more slowly. The Economic Policy Institute’s Productivity–Pay Tracker shows that “Since the late 1970s, our policy choices have led to a pronounced divergence between productivity and typical workers’ pay.” . Specifically, from 1979 to 2021, U.S. net productivity (after accounting for depreciation) rose about 64% , whereas the hourly compensation of the median worker rose only about 17% in real terms . Updated EPI data to 2025 indicate that “Productivity has grown 2.7 times as much as pay” for the typical worker since 1979 . In concrete terms, “1979–2025: productivity +86.0%, hourly pay +32.0%” (the EPI series uses a broader definition of pay including benefits, which gives 32% growth90 117 118 119 120 119 121 122 123 124 125 125 126 127 126 127 17 – but the median hourly wage has grown only around 17%, as noted, meaning even that 32% likely reflects faster growth for higher earners). Either way, there is a large gap. The median worker today would be earning far more if wages had kept up with productivity ; one estimate is that median pay would be about 40% higher (around $3–4 extra per hour in the U.S.) if the old linkage had held . The causes of this decoupling are debated but closely tied to labor’s weakened position. The EPI identifies that after 1979, various policy shifts intentionally suppressed wage growth : higher tolerance of unemployment (to fight inflation) weakened workers’ leverage; the real value of the minimum wage was allowed to erode; labor laws failed to halt rising anti-union practices; top tax rates were slashed (encouraging executive pay boosts and profit-taking over wage distribution); deregulation in industries undermined union strongholds; globalization put pressure on manufacturing wages; and so on . In short, what EPI calls the “abandonment of the policy of equitable growth” in the late 1970s led directly to the pay-productivity divergence . From another perspective, globalization and technological change have also played a role – but their impact on who gains from productivity often comes down to power and institutions. For example, when automation or trade competition hits an industry, whether the workforce shares in any productivity gains from new tech, or whether they lose their jobs and the gains accrue solely to capital, depends on labor’s bargaining power and government policies. Labor’s diminishing share and the wage decoupling signal that a growing portion of economic output is being captured by owners of capital (shareholders, corporate profits, etc.) rather than by workers . This is historically unusual – in earlier times, tight labor markets or strong unions would force some redistribution. But in the present era, phenomena like the rise of “superstar firms” and monopolies may be reinforcing labor’s weakness. As McKinsey noted, increased market consolidation in many sectors (think tech giants or mega-firms in retail) has given certain employers outsized power to set wages and conditions. When only a few employers dominate a labor market (a condition economists term “monopsony”), wages tend to be lower . Additionally, financialization and shareholder primacy models have led firms to prioritize profit payouts over wage increases. If workers cannot effectively bargain for a share of productivity gains, those gains go to profits, which either sit as corporate cash, get invested (sometimes in automation that further reduces labor’s share), or are distributed to shareholders (who are disproportionately the wealthy). The macroeconomic and societal implications of these trends are significant. A declining labor share means that aggregate demand can be weaker (since workers generally spend a higher fraction of their income than capital owners do), potentially contributing to secular stagnation or more fragile growth. It also means income and wealth inequality widens , as more income flows to capital, which is very unevenly held. Indeed, in the U.S., the top 1%’s share of income roughly doubled from ~10% in 1980 to ~20% by 2016, correlating with the labor share drop and union decline. Research suggests the fall in labor share itself is a key factor in rising inequality . The EPI explicitly states that the wedge between productivity and pay has meant “the fruits of economic growth are not going to workers, but instead went into the salaries of highly paid employees and higher profits (returns to shareholders and wealth owners)” , driving overall economic inequality . This concentration of income and wealth can then circle back into political power (through lobbying, campaign finance, etc.), making it harder for workers to redress the imbalance – a vicious cycle.128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 136 137 18 Structural Impediments to Labor in the 21st Century: Globalization, Technology, and Policy Choices What underlies these measurable declines in labor power? Several structural shifts and policy-driven impediments in recent decades can be identified: Globalization and Offshoring: The integration of global labor markets, especially the entry of huge labor pools from China, Eastern Europe, and the developing world into the global capitalist system since the 1990s, has exerted downward pressure on wages and weakened unions in advanced economies. Corporations gained the credible threat of moving production abroad or outsourcing tasks to cheaper contractors overseas, which undermined workers’ bargaining leverage at home. An NBER study by Dorn, Katz, et al., for example, found that trade shocks (like the “China shock”) led to job losses, lower wages, and weakened labor force participation in affected U.S. regions. Unions in manufacturing saw membership decline as factories closed or were restructured to stay competitive. Globalization also fragmented production: supply chains spread across countries, making it harder for any local workforce to exert pressure (because a strike in one place could be bypassed by shifting production temporarily to another). International competition became a common rationale for suppressing wage growth – employers would say, implicitly or explicitly, “accept less or we can’t compete with China/Mexico/etc.” Without coordinated international labor standards, this “race to the bottom” eroded labor’s power . Indeed, as the Atlantic Council piece notes, “Technological advancement and globalization… negatively impacted some workers who lost their jobs to automation or outsourcing” , and U.S. unionization fell also due to these structural changes. Technological Change and Automation (including AI): Rapid advances in technology, from robotics in manufacturing to artificial intelligence in services, have changed the labor landscape. Historically, technology can create new jobs even as it destroys others, but the transition can be painful and the distribution of gains can favor capital unless policies ensure otherwise . In recent years, many tech innovations have been labor-saving or labor-replacing. For example, the rise of e- commerce and automation contributed to job declines in retail and warehouses (or turned stable jobs into more gig-like work). Now, AI (Artificial Intelligence) looms as potentially a far greater disruptive force. Some experts fear that AI could “permanently reduce the importance of labor in the economy” if it indeed can perform a wide array of cognitive tasks . A Federal Reserve analysis warns that “Unlike previous technologies, AI may undermine labor’s share of national income” , by enabling economic growth with far fewer workers needed – meaning the default outcome could be a further fall in labor share and perhaps technological unemployment for many. Even if full unemployment is avoided, AI might put a lid on wages: if AI can increase productivity dramatically but workers have little bargaining power , we may see even more extreme decoupling (gains all accruing to a few tech owners). Already, a Harvard study by Deming and Summers (2023) finds early evidence that AI is reordering labor demand, hitting certain mid-skill jobs. The bargaining position of labor is further weakened if human work is seen as more easily replaceable by machines . Historically, strong labor movements or laws forced new technology’s benefits to be shared (e.g., shortening working hours, raising wages) – absent that, technology can simply reduce labor’s slice. The generative AI boom of 2020s raises precisely such questions. In sum, while technology could in theory liberate workers (by producing more wealth with less toil), under current institutional arrangements it appears poised to mostly boost profits unless countervailing power grows. This contributes to a sense of precarity among workers and likely further weakens their confidence to demand higher pay (for fear of being automated away).• 138 139 • 140 141 140 142 19 The Rise of “Gig” Work and Employment Casualization: A notable trend is the shift from traditional employment relationships to more contingent, non-standard work arrangements . Companies in many sectors have adopted strategies to minimize their formal workforce – through subcontracting, using temp agencies, classifying workers as independent contractors, or using online platforms to match labor on-demand (gig economy). For instance, ride-share drivers for Uber/ Lyft, food delivery couriers, or task-based online freelancers are often legally not “employees.” This means they usually lack the right to unionize (under U.S. law, only “employees” can form unions; contractors cannot), are not covered by many labor protections (minimum wage, overtime, anti- discrimination laws may not apply in the same way), and bear more risk for their own benefits and downtime. The gig economy model has spread beyond tech platforms – many regular businesses now seek to label workers as contractors to cut costs. The Atlantic Council analysis specifically cites “worker classification rules” as a factor – meaning loopholes that let companies treat workers as contractors – which have undermined unionization . Additionally, even among employees, there’s been a rise in part-time, temporary, or leased labor (an example is the growth of staffing agencies). All these forms make it harder for workers to organize (they may not have a common workplace, or their tenuous employment makes them fearful). It also makes solidarity more difficult – if workers are pitted as individual entrepreneurs or are constantly churned. As one example, Amazon warehouses often rely on temp staffing, and drivers are often contractors – both strategies to avoid one stable group of workers that could organize. The outcome is a fragmented labor force with less collective strength. Legal and Institutional Changes Unfavorable to Labor: Beyond the headline laws (like right-to- work, or the weakening of labor law enforcement), myriad policy decisions have skewed the field against workers. To illustrate: anti-trust enforcement’s laxity has allowed corporate mergers that reduce competition in hiring (when there are fewer employers, they have more monopsony power to keep wages down). Intellectual property rules and investor protections have often been strengthened (boosting capital returns), whereas expansions of labor rights (like card-check union recognition, or sectoral bargaining laws) have stalled in many countries. Even macroeconomic policy can be seen through this lens: central banks’ overriding focus on low inflation often leads to higher interest rates whenever wages begin rising – effectively putting a brake on workers’ gains to protect asset values . In the 1980s and 1990s, high unemployment was tolerated or even induced by policy in the name of disinflation, which had the side effect of seriously undercutting labor’s negotiating position (nothing weakens labor more than a reserve army of the unemployed willing to take any job). Only recently have some central banks (like the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2020-21) begun acknowledging full employment as a priority, though even that changed in 2022 with inflation spikes leading to rate hikes that cooled the job market again. In combination, these structural forces have created what might be called a “perfect storm” against organized labor in advanced economies. It’s not that workers lack all power – indeed, as of 2021-2022, tight labor markets post-pandemic gave some short-term leverage in certain sectors (leading to wage upticks and more union activity in the U.S. at companies like Starbucks and Amazon). However , the general trend remains that labor’s institutional power is far weaker than it was mid-20th century . The resurgence of some labor activism (like a wave of strikes in 2023 in the U.S. entertainment and auto industries) shows discontent, but also highlights how unusual such strikes had become relative to history. In the early postwar decades, strikes were common and a normal part of bargaining; by the 2000s, the number of large strikes in the U.S. had dwindled to near zero some years, reflecting resignation and lack of union density.• 112 143 • 20 Social and Political Consequences of Declining Labor Power Today The decline of labor power is not just an economic story; it has profound social and political repercussions that echo the historical cases we discussed, albeit in modern form. Key consequences observed or emerging include: Rising Inequality and Stagnant Living Standards for Many: As noted, a smaller share of income for labor and stunted wage growth for typical workers mean that while GDP and productivity have grown, many people do not feel better off. In the U.S., for example, median real household income has barely budged since around 2000 (and even since the 1970s, gains have been modest compared to prior eras). Wealth inequality has soared – the top 0.1% owns as much wealth as the bottom ~80% of families. Such inequality can erode social cohesion and fuels a sense of injustice. It also can be self-perpetuating because the wealthy use their resources to shape policy (e.g., influencing tax laws, campaign finance, etc.). Thomas Piketty’s famous work “Capital in the 21st Century” and subsequent research by Saez, Zucman, and others, tie the decline of unions and progressive taxation to the new “gilded age” levels of inequality. Historically, high inequality has often been associated with less stable democracies and more oligarchic influence – we see some of that today in the form of billionaire political donors and highly unequal influence over media and political agendas. Erosion of Democratic Representation: When economic power concentrates, political power often follows. In the U.S., political scientists have found that policy outcomes correlate far more with the preferences of the affluent than those of the median voter , suggesting a tilt toward plutocracy. The weakening of organized labor – which in mid-20th century was a countervailing force and a major voice for the working class in politics – is directly linked to this. For instance, the decline of unions in states and nationally has been statistically connected to lower voter turnout among low-income voters and a shift of the political spectrum rightward on economic issues. Union members historically vote at higher rates and, through their unions, help educate and mobilize others. With that infrastructure diminished, many working-class people are disengaged or feel unrepresented , which can manifest in apathy or in attraction to anti-establishment candidates who at least acknowledge their anger . This is one explanation for the success of certain populist politicians who, while not necessarily delivering pro-labor policies, speak to the disaffected working- class experience (sometimes blaming scapegoats like immigrants). The TUC’s Nowak pointed out how even internationally, where unions are suppressed, democracy suffers – citing examples like Myanmar’s junta targeting unionists, Bolsonaro in Brazil attacking unions and indigenous rights together , and Colombia’s violent suppression of unions alongside persecution of minority groups . These underscore that the freedom to organize at work is intertwined with broader freedoms . Indeed, in many of the 50 countries where violence against workers is documented, it goes hand in hand with authoritarian practices. Social Fragmentation and Distrust: A society in which workers feel left behind while elites prosper can breed resentment and undermine trust in institutions. We see rising distrust of government, media, and even of fellow citizens in many countries. The decline of stable, well-paid jobs (that often came with union membership and a sense of solidarity) has in some communities led to despair – as evidenced by problems like the opioid epidemic in deindustrialized parts of the U.S. or high suicide rates among jobless middle-aged workers. The concept of “deaths of despair” (Case and Deaton) in the U.S. ties some of this to economic changes and the loss of social structures including unions.• • 144 145 • 21 Historically, union halls and worker associations were part of the social fabric; their loss is part of a wider story of communal breakdown. Rise of Precarious “Precariat” Class: The new generation of workers faces more insecurity – gig workers, contract workers, part-time workers who juggle multiple jobs, etc., sometimes called the “precariat.” This group often has no voice at work and no expectation of long-term improvement . Such precarious conditions can make people less willing to engage civically (political participation tends to drop when people are economically stressed and constantly hustling to survive) and more cynical about democracy delivering for them. Some may turn to more extreme political alternatives out of frustration. Policy Inaction on Worker Issues: With labor weak, policies that could help rebalance things (like stronger labor laws, higher minimum wages, robust social safety nets, or co-determination in companies) often stagnate or are watered down. This creates a feedback loop where problems worsen. For example, although there’s popular support in many countries for raising minimum wages or providing universal healthcare or strengthening unions’ ability to bargain, these often get blocked by powerful business lobbies and lack an equally strong labor lobby to push back. In short, the decline of labor power in advanced economies today is correlated with many of the worrying trends in democratic societies : increased polarization (sometimes along cultural lines which fill the void left by class politics), voter alienation, populist insurgencies, and a sense that governments favor the elite. It is perhaps not a coincidence that the period of highest union density (mid-20th century) corresponded with comparatively low inequality and a politics that delivered broad-based growth (the “postwar consensus” in the UK or the New Deal order in the US), whereas the current low ebb of unions corresponds with second Gilded Age inequality and tumultuous politics. To be sure, correlation is not causation, but a number of political analyses (e.g., Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson’s work) argue that the weakening of unions removed a key anchor of center-left politics that championed middle-class interests, thus allowing more extreme or plutocratic dynamics to emerge. Even centrists like former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers (not known as a pro-union figure historically) have recently warned that if capitalism doesn’t deliver for the majority, liberal democracy will be imperiled – and he noted part of the solution may be strengthening worker bargaining. In summary, the evidence is overwhelming that labor power is in retreat in modern advanced economies , as shown by declining unionization, falling labor share of income, and stagnant median wages despite ongoing productivity growth. The causes are multi-fold – technological, global, and political. And this retreat is not just an economic concern but a socio-political one: it undermines the egalitarian underpinnings of democracy and leads to societies that are more unequal, more unstable, and often less humane (in the treatment of workers and the marginalised). In light of the historical perspective from Section II, one might say we are witnessing a milder (but still significant) version of the pattern: as organized labor’s influence fades, we see erosions in democratic accountability (policy responds less to popular needs), erosions in social cohesion (community breakdown and despair), and implicitly, a reduced valuation of ordinary people’s lives by those in power (e.g., willingness to allow mass layoffs, refusal to provide universal healthcare, etc.). While we are not in an openly autocratic scenario in most advanced economies, some warning signs are present. This sets the stage for the final part of the report: examining proposals to address these issues by substituting labor power with alternative mechanisms (like UBI or public dividends) and assessing whether they can truly compensate for what has been lost.• • 22 The Limits of Replacing Labor Power: Why UBI and Similar Ideas Fall Short Without Structural Change In response to the trends outlined above – technological unemployment fears, gig work precarity, stagnant wages, and extreme inequality – a number of intellectuals and policymakers have proposed various forms of “income floor” or alternative distribution mechanisms to ensure people’s livelihoods without relying on traditional labor bargaining. These include Universal Basic Income (UBI) schemes (regular cash payments to all individuals regardless of work), sovereign or social wealth funds that pay out dividends to citizens (sometimes called “universal basic dividend”), or other concepts like negative income taxes, guaranteed jobs, etc. The appeal of these ideas is clear: if labor markets no longer guarantee stable and sufficient incomes for a large share of the population, then the state (or society collectively) might step in to provide income directly. Some also argue that such measures could empower individuals by decoupling survival from having to take any job – for instance, UBI proponents like Srnicek and Williams suggest that a basic income could “partially decommodify labor” and give workers the option to refuse poor jobs, thus “overturning the asymmetry of power between labor and capital.” . In theory, a generous UBI could strengthen workers’ hands: they wouldn’t starve if they strike or quit, so employers might have to offer better terms to attract them. However , while these proposals are intriguing and potentially part of future solutions, there are strong reasons to be skeptical that they can substitute for labor power in any straightforward way under current conditions . Implementing such schemes at a meaningful level is politically and economically difficult, and even if implemented, without qualitative changes in civic infrastructure and redistribution mechanisms , they might not achieve the intended effects or could even be co-opted in ways that leave underlying power imbalances intact. In this section, we critically examine these substitution strategies. The Practical Challenges of UBI and Wealth Dividends Universal Basic Income – the idea of giving everyone a flat cash grant sufficient to live on – faces major hurdles. First, cost : a true UBI that isn’t tokenistic (i.e., that provides an income near poverty line or higher) would require a large share of GDP in taxes or reallocated spending. For example, in the U.S., a UBI of $12,000 per year for 250 million adults would cost $3 trillion annually, roughly 75% of total federal tax revenue. Funding such an amount likely means significant tax increases on the wealthy or middle class, or cuts to other programs, or heavy deficit spending. In smaller countries or those with resource wealth, it might be more feasible (e.g., Alaska’s Permanent Fund dividend is often cited: it pays a few thousand dollars a year from oil revenues to each resident, which is nice but not a full living income). Hilary Clinton in her 2016 campaign considered a UBI-style proposal (“Alaska for America”) but “couldn’t make the numbers work,” so she dropped it . Indeed, her plan would have been to use something like a sovereign wealth fund model (the Peter Barnes idea of dividends from common assets) – which has merit but building a huge fund takes time and initial capital. If a UBI is funded by heavy taxation of the rich and corporations, it faces the political power of those groups who will lobby furiously to prevent it (especially in an era where labor is weak, the wealthy have even more sway). If it’s funded by a regressive tax, it might just recycle money from the public back to the public inefficiently. There’s also a fear among left critics that a UBI could be used by the right as a “Trojan horse” to dismantle existing welfare states . For instance, if UBI replaces all other benefits (healthcare, housing support, etc.), people could end up worse off if the UBI is not high enough. The146 147 148 149 150 151 23 Jacobin article “The Case Against a Basic Income” notes that many UBI proposals that try to be budget- neutral would give each adult a fairly low monthly sum but in exchange eliminate various means-tested programs – resulting in net losses for the poorest. It cites a UK study by Compass where a “full” basic income scheme of £292 a month, replacing other benefits, would “increase child poverty by 10% and overall working-age poverty by 3-4%.” . A more generous scheme that doesn’t replace benefits costs a lot and still has complexity. This speaks to a core issue: without strong labor or popular influence, any enacted UBI might be set too low to truly empower individuals. A token basic income (say, $200 a month) would not allow one to refuse a bad job; it would just be a small subsidy potentially absorbed by landlords or employers (who could pay correspondingly lower wages). For a basic income to fundamentally alter the labor-capital power balance, it must be high enough that one can live decently without working. But if labor is too weak to secure normal wage gains or safety nets right now, why assume it could win a truly sufficient UBI politically? It might instead get an inadequate compromise. Srnicek and Williams themselves acknowledged that “to overturn the asymmetry of power… [UBI] must provide a sufficient amount of income to live on. If the payment isn’t high enough… UBI might push wages down and create more ‘bullshit jobs’.” . That is, a low UBI could actually subsidize low-wage employers (by effectively supplementing wages so employers could pay even less – similar to how welfare or tax credits sometimes effectively prop up poverty- wage models). This fear is echoed by many unions who worry that UBI could undermine the work-based solidarity and be a ploy to say “here’s some cash, now don’t complain about your job conditions.” In fact, major unions and labor movements have been wary or hostile to UBI , often preferring a job guarantee or strengthened labor rights. For example, in Europe, many unions argue that resources should go to improving public services and social insurance rather than an unconditional income that might erode the work ethic or the centrality of work-based entitlements. The Dissent article notes “labor unions have been slow to get on board” with UBI . Some unionists see it as distracting from the fight for better wages and conditions – Andy Stern being an outlier in that he left the labor movement and championed UBI, which many of his peers disagreed with. In one sense, UBI could be seen as a surrender: an acceptance that we can’t change how jobs are, so we just compensate people. Critics on the left like in Catalyst Journal have argued it’s an “ideological capitulation” to neoliberalism, potentially even “universalizing precarious labor and extending the sphere of the market.” . For example, if everyone gets a basic income, perhaps governments feel justified in fully withdrawing from other responsibilities (privatizing healthcare or education, since now you have ‘money to buy it’ – except the money may not suffice). One author wrote that UBI “indexes neoliberalism’s progress” in that it often gains traction in times of social defeat, not advance . Indeed, interest in UBI surged after the 2008 crisis and again during Covid-19, largely as emergency responses to breakdowns in labor markets. Sovereign wealth funds or citizen’s dividends are a related idea – for instance, Alaska’s fund gives a yearly dividend (~$1000-2000) from oil revenue. It’s popular , but it hasn’t prevented Alaska from having budget crises or ensuring high public service levels. It’s also a small amount relative to needs. Some propose a “social wealth fund” at the national level – e.g., economist Rudolph G. Penner once suggested the U.S. government should buy equities and use the returns for public benefit. The challenge is acquiring enough assets. Norway has a massive oil fund that supports its welfare state; but Norway also has very high union density and collective bargaining, which existed before the fund – the fund didn’t replace labor power , it supplements it. If anything, Norway shows that strong institutions + wealth fund = broad gains , whereas wealth fund alone might not suffice if political winds change (imagine a future Alaskan governor ending the152 153 146 154 155 156 157 54 24 dividend to cover deficits or favoring corporate subsidies instead – citizens have limited recourse except elections). Another concern is what one might call the rentier state problem applied domestically. If the state gives everyone an income, how do people maintain political leverage? In classic rentier states (like Gulf oil monarchies), citizens pay no taxes and often get handouts; in exchange, they typically have few rights and little say – the logic "no taxation, no representation" in reverse . The government doesn’t need to negotiate with a tax base or a labor base, it can buy loyalty. A UBI funded by, say, a carbon tax or wealth tax might avoid that exact scenario since presumably some democratic process enacted it, but if the populace becomes reliant on a depersonalized state stipend rather than wages they fought for , would that change their orientation? Some fear a pacification effect : UBI might quiet dissent just enough to prevent more radical changes. As one international magazine from the left put it, “the campaign for UBI threatens to divert political energies and funds from more important causes” – in other words, it could be a pressure release that forestalls pushes for stronger unions or truly universal services. In essence, replacing labor bargaining with top-down redistribution is insufficient if the underlying power structures remain skewed. Without a strong civic foundation (unions, cooperatives, community organizations) to defend and adjust a UBI or dividend scheme, it could be eroded (a new administration could cut it, as was attempted in some trial countries), or it may not achieve genuine empowerment. Historically, enduring progressive policies required ongoing mobilization to protect them. Consider the welfare states of Europe – they were built in part because labor movements were strong; where labor is weaker (e.g. U.S.), welfare is weaker and constantly attacked. A UBI introduced in a context of low labor power could similarly be rolled back or used as justification to strip other supports. The notion of “qualitatively stronger civic infrastructure” means we would need a robust framework of institutions (perhaps new forms of worker associations, community councils, etc.) to ensure any such scheme truly benefits people and doesn’t just get offset by market adjustments (like landlords hiking rents because everyone has more cash, etc.). It also means people having a voice in governance so that if UBI needs to be increased or modified, it happens through democratic pressure, not at the whims of elites. Right now, in many countries, the momentum of policy is controlled by corporate lobbies more than mass movements, so a UBI might be implemented in a suboptimal way. To illustrate the dangers: Imagine a future where automation causes high unemployment. One path is robust labor unions pushing for reduced workweeks and job-sharing, preserving a role for labor in production and retaining dignity of work. Another path is the state just pays UBI to the unemployed and leaves production fully to tech giants and capital owners. In the latter scenario, inequality of power could become extreme: masses of people dependent on stipends and a small elite controlling the productive assets (robots/AI). If that elite captures the state, they could easily trim the stipends. It might devolve into a dystopia of social control (the stipend as leash). This is why some critics argue that without democratic control of the economy (“institutional redistribution” in terms of who owns technology and capital), a basic income alone could even entrench a new form of serfdom – everyone getting subsistence from a sovereign, rather than having self-determination through work or collective ownership. This isn’t to dismiss UBI or dividends entirely – they could be part of a future where labor’s role in production is genuinely diminished by technology (some see it as inevitable). But the key is that such schemes must be embedded in a context of empowered citizenry and institutional checks . If UBI is introduced in a neoliberal context, it may simply accompany further dismantling of public goods and labor158 159 160 161 25 rights. One analysis laments that the idea is dangerously “politically ambiguous” and could go right or left – e.g., libertarian Silicon Valley figures back UBI as a means to stave off unrest without changing the system . Substitution strategies like UBI also don’t inherently restore voice or agency to people . Having money is crucial, but democracy is about more than material wellbeing – it’s about participation and power in decisions. Traditional labor power gave workers a say in the workplace and by extension in politics (through unions, they collectively bargained and also lobbied). A UBI treats individuals as isolated consumers who just need income. It doesn’t solve issues of workplace autocracy (where those with jobs still have little say) or of community governance. One could argue it might even weaken solidarity – if everyone gets their own separate check, the impetus to band together might lessen, as some may opt out of the labor force content with a minimal lifestyle while others still struggle – potentially causing social divide. From another angle, proposals like Job Guarantee (JG) – where the state ensures a job at a liveable wage to anyone who wants one – might better preserve the linkage of work, income, and civic participation. A JG could empower labor by setting a wage floor (private employers must pay at least that or lose workers) and by giving workers a fallback option, enhancing their bargaining (similar to UBI’s intended effect but through work). However , JGs come with their own complexities (managing potentially millions of public jobs, ensuring they are meaningful, etc.). They too require strong institutions to implement well. The phrase in the question “ qualitatively stronger civic infrastructure and institutional redistribution ” implies that without transforming institutions of power , these monetary fixes won’t achieve the desired outcome. Institutional redistribution might mean things like co-determination laws (workers on company boards) , collective capital ownership (like publicly owned chunks of companies or national investment funds), or sectoral bargaining arrangements that give workers voice across industries. Those are structural changes that redistribute not just money but power and decision-making. Without them, UBI might redistribute some money but leave power highly concentrated, which in time could undermine the monetary distribution. Another perspective: The “Nordic model” – high union density, strong welfare state funded by taxes, and cooperative labor relations – has managed to deliver both security and voice to workers. It did not rely on UBI, but on negotiated systems and comprehensive social benefits (healthcare, education, unemployment insurance) that don’t replace labor power but complement it. If one were to implement a UBI in a Nordic country, it might function better precisely because strong unions and political cultures would adjust it and maintain other supports. Implementing one in a country with weak labor (like the U.S.) could instead lead to it being inadequate and scapegoated (“look, we gave you money and you still complain”). Finally, consider rentier state analogy concretely: In the Gulf States, citizen-dividends (free oil money, free services, no taxes) have coexisted with authoritarian rule. The populace has a material stake in the regime (don’t rock the boat or you lose the benefits) and little political voice. Transplanting a version of that domestically could mean a stable but undemocratic equilibrium: people sedated by a stipend, tech oligarchs running the show. Unless citizens have strong organizations (like a union of UBI recipients?) to demand adjustment if needed, it could become like a feudal tithe in reverse. In summary , merely replacing labor power with UBI or wealth dividends is structurally insufficient if not accompanied by a rebalancing of power through robust civic institutions and redistribution of control. Labor power historically wasn’t just about money; it was about dignity, voice, and a check on162 150 26 concentrated authority . UBI addresses a symptom (lack of income) but not the disease (lack of power). To “prove” this, one can point to the many scenarios discussed: In absence of strong civic institutions, a UBI can be curtailed or used to justify cutting other rights (as with some low-level UBI proposals increasing poverty ). Rentier examples show money without representation yields poor accountability . Leading voices on UBI themselves warn it only works as liberatory if high enough, which likely requires already strong political mobilization . Even pragmatic issues like landlords raising rents in response to UBI illustrate that without complementary measures (like rent control or housing provision – i.e., institutional interventions), the benefit can be partly appropriated by capital. Therefore, one cannot “technocratically” fix the decline of labor with a financial bandaid – it requires, as the question states, “qualitatively stronger civic infrastructure and institutional redistribution.” In plainer terms: to avoid the catastrophic consequences of labor decline, we need to rebuild collective organizations (unions, cooperatives, civic groups) and possibly new democratic economic institutions (like public ownership stakes, co-determination, stronger social safety nets that aren’t just cash but services) that give people security and voice. Historian and socialist thinkers often emphasize that “economic power begets political power.” If all economic power is with capital (even if they give out stipends), political democracy is hollow. The solution has to include giving workers/citizens more say in economic decisions – which is what robust labor power did in its heyday. UBI might be part of a future social contract, but without empowering people in other ways, it’s not a panacea. As a final note, even the pilot programs of basic income (like in Finland 2017-18) showed mixed results – it improved happiness, but didn’t significantly change employment. However , participants reported less stress. If scaled up, who knows if those results hold. Many questions remain. Thus, while substitution strategies come from good intent to alleviate the plight of labor in a changing world, they cannot “trivially” reverse the trend or its consequences because the issue is deeper – it’s about power , structure, and institutions. Just as Bismarck’s social insurance in the 1880s improved workers’ lives but did not grant them voice (and Germany still had intense class conflicts leading into the 20th century), a UBI might improve material conditions somewhat but wouldn’t inherently democratize the economy or society. And as we’ve seen, lacking that democratization, the rights and value of human life can still be compromised (e.g., an authoritarian government could still suppress freedoms even if people have a basic income, much like how petro-states suppress dissent while bribing citizens). In conclusion, meaningful solutions likely require a combination: strengthening labor organizations, updating laws to fit new work realities (cover gig workers, etc.), and yes, possibly new forms of broad-based sharing of wealth (like a social fund or targeted guaranteed incomes) – but always in a framework where people collectively have control and oversight. Otherwise, you risk either not implementing these ideas at a scale that matters or implementing them in ways that pacify rather than empower . The decline of labor power is fundamentally a political problem, not just an economic one, and thus the remedy must be political (rebuilding democratic participation in the economy) as much as financial.• 152 • 77 • 146 154 • 27 Conclusion This extensive examination has demonstrated, across historical and contemporary domains, that the decline of labor power is politically and socially catastrophic, is actively occurring in advanced economies today, and cannot be remedied by superficial substitutions alone . From ancient Rome and China to modern democracies, when working people lost their leverage – whether as independent yeoman, organized guild members, or unionized workers – the results included erosions of civil rights, democratic accountability, and a diminished regard for human life by those in power . Labor’s collective strength has historically been a bulwark of more egalitarian and humane societies; its weakness opens the door to oligarchy, authoritarianism, and extreme inequality. In the present era, we have charted a clear decline of labor’s influence: union densities are at historic lows in many countries, labor’s share of income has fallen significantly (with the fruits of growth accruing disproportionately to capital ), and wages have decoupled from productivity . Structural forces like globalization, technological change (now epitomized by AI), and deliberate policy choices have all contributed to weakening workers’ bargaining power . The consequences are already visible – greater income inequality, stagnant or precarious livelihoods for large segments of society, and a sense of powerlessness fueling political disillusionment and instability. We see echoes of the past: just as disenfranchised peasants or proletarians of earlier times turned to upheaval or followed demagogues when they had no other recourse, today’s disenfranchised working classes are increasingly drawn to anti- establishment movements, or in despair , withdraw from civic life. These are warning signs of democratic decay from within. Crucially, we found that proposals to replace labor power with technocratic fixes like Universal Basic Income or citizen wealth dividends, while well-intentioned, are no substitute for the organized power of workers . Without addressing the underlying distribution of power and voice – through robust civic institutions and structural redistribution of wealth and control – such measures are likely to be insufficient. A UBI in a society with weak labor can be set too low, co-opted, or used to further entrench a two-tier system where citizens are passive recipients rather than active shapers of their social conditions . Historical rentier-state dynamics caution that detaching income from participation (“no representation without taxation or work”) can undermine democracy rather than strengthen it . Ultimately, the challenge is not merely to alleviate the material symptoms of labor’s decline, but to restore the balance of power** – to rebuild institutions that give workers and citizens collective agency in the economy and polity. In every period studied, labor’s power was not given; it was organized and won – whether through peasant communes, parliaments of property-owning farmers, or modern trade unions. When those institutions faltered or were crushed, the social contract deteriorated. Therefore, the lesson for our time is clear . To prevent a slide into a new form of oligarchy or authoritarianism – a future where inequality widens unchecked and nominal democracies serve only the few – we must reinvigorate the institutions that elevate labor’s voice . This could mean modernizing labor laws to cover gig and contract workers, promoting sector-wide bargaining to set fair wages, encouraging worker cooperatives and works councils, enforcing competition laws to combat monopsony power , and indeed exploring innovative ideas like public wealth funds or basic incomes – but always anchored in a framework of democratic oversight and collective empowerment . 163 126 111 156 157 77 28 Without such measures, the trends we have identified will likely accelerate. The advent of AI and further automation may put even more downward pressure on the labor share , potentially leading to what some economists call “nullification of the working class” in production. If society does not correct course, we could face a scenario reminiscent of the darkest historical analogies – a wealthy elite enjoying unprecedented prosperity (as did Roman latifundists or colonial planters), a weakened middle and working class with little recourse (like the landless peasants or disenfranchised proletarians of old), and a politics that oscillates between plutocracy and populist backlash. The “state’s valuation of human life” in such a scenario tends to diminish: we already witness in some policy debates a startling indifference to deaths of despair , to workers’ safety (for example, the push to roll back labor regulations), and to basic livelihoods – analogous in principle to how past regimes treated expendable peasantries or serfs. However , history also offers hope: labor power has been rebuilt after periods of decline. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw international labor movements rise to tame rampant industrial capitalism, winning both welfare reforms and political rights. The fall of apartheid showed that determined worker and civic action could overturn an oppressive order in favor of democracy and more equitable arrangements. If today we are in a downswing, it is not inevitable fate but a call to action. The evidence marshaled in this report can serve as both a warning and a guide. The warning is that allowing labor’s decline to continue unchecked will result in a harsher , less democratic, and more unstable society – a result consistently observed in the annals of history. The guide is that renewal is possible: by re-empowering labor in tandem with progressive policy , we can foster a more inclusive economy that values every human life and upholds the rights and dignity of all citizens. In closing, the comprehensive and empirical proof assembled here leads to an unequivocal conclusion: labor’s power is fundamental to a fair and free society . Its decline is not just an economic trend but a seismic political and moral crisis – one actively unfolding around us. Reversing it will require deliberate efforts to strengthen the institutions of worker voice and economic justice. Superficial solutions – cash handouts in lieu of rights – will not suffice and may even backfire without deeper change. History’s verdict is clear: societies that empower their working people thrive more securely in liberty and justice, whereas those that marginalize and silence them pave the road to ruin. It is up to our generation to heed these lessons and act before the erosion goes too far . The stakes – civil rights, democracy, and the value of human life itself – could not be higher .

Ancient commentators Plutarch and Appian blamed the rise of latifundia for the Republic’s troubles . Tang Dynasty China’s post-Equal Field land concentration: Wolfram Eberhard’s history (via Facts and Details ) records that after 755, “large estates” grew and “the central state barely interfered… acting merely as tax collector for roughly a millennium” , reflecting peasants’ loss of status . Tudor England’s enclosure and worker repression: Wikipedia notes widespread evictions and that historians see “the deprivations of displaced workers” as causing unrest . By 1799, Britain explicitly outlawed worker unions – the Combination Act punished any attempt by workers to collectively seek better terms with jail or hard labor . Imperial Russia’s serfdom kept peasants powerless: as described in Works in Progress , serfs owed about half their labor output to lords , couldn’t move freely, and the state harnessed this coercion140 • 164 165 15 • 4 • 38 44 • 29 for an army, conscripting peasants for 25 years . After emancipation, heavy “redemption payments” left many in poverty, with official data confirming “the redemption tax was so high… serfs had to sell all grain… leaving nothing to survive” , sparking unrest . Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany’s crushing of labor rights as precursor to tyranny: Luxus Plus notes “Mussolini banned free trade unions in 1925, replacing them with Fascist unions… to neutralize workers’ demands.” The 1927 Charter made clear that individual rights were subordinate to state interests . In Hitler’s Germany, on May 2, 1933, “all trade unions were closed down… leaders attacked and imprisoned. German workers were forced to join the state Labor Front” , eliminating independent worker voice . The TUC commemorates that “The Nazi ban on free trade unions… removed a bastion of democracy… an early step in their rule of terror.” . Apartheid South Africa’s exploitation of labor: Black workers were legally denied union membership and thus any protection; mines became “killing fields for workers denied health and safety legislation.” . Only with unionization in the 1980s did conditions improve and apartheid’s system begin to collapse . Current advanced economies’ labor decline: Atlantic Council (2022) observes “one in five US workers were union members in 1983; today roughly one in ten are” , also that during this period “the share of national income going to labor has decreased, inequality has increased” , and evidence suggests *“the decline of unions… has been a major factor in these trends.” . McKinsey (2019) documents advanced-economy labor share dropping from ~54% in 1980 to ~50.5% in 2014 , with some hitting half-century lows . Wage-productivity gap: EPI’s tracker shows since 1979 U.S. productivity (net) +~64% vs typical workers’ pay +~17%, meaning “Productivity has grown 2.7 times as much as pay.” . The missing gains went largely to corporate profits and top incomes . The insufficiency of UBI-like fixes without power redistribution: Dissent’s critique warns UBI’s cross- ideological appeal masks that it can be “a Trojan horse” – left critics fear it could dissolve welfare, right endorsers see it as tool to avoid deeper change . Jacobin argues a low UBI that replaces benefits can make the poor worse off, citing a model where poverty rates would rise if a full basic income simply supplanted existing supports . Srnicek/Williams (accelerationists supportive of UBI) nonetheless caution it only truly empowers if “high enough to live on” , else it might depress wages . In short, context matters – * “UBI isn’t an alternative to neoliberalism, but an ideological capitulation to it,” one left essay asserts, if implemented without a broader shift . These sources reinforce our analysis at each step. The trajectory is consistent: labor’s decline = rights at risk; labor’s strength = greater equality and democracy . And importantly, attempts to solve labor’s woes without labor (i.e., via top-down cash) are inadequate in the absence of structural empowerment. The findings are as relevant as ever . As we navigate an era of rapid technological upheaval and global economic shifts, understanding the historical and present linkage between labor power and societal health is crucial. This report provides that understanding, grounded in extensive evidence. The conclusion is not merely academic but a clarion call: revaluing human life and revitalizing democracy in the 21st century depend fundamentally on rebalancing power toward labor – through institutions, laws, and norms that ensure working people have an effective voice and stake in the systems that govern their lives . Anything less would be to repeat the mistakes of the past on an even grander scale, an outcome we can ill afford.5762 76 • 7880 8384 36 • 95 102 • 108 114 117 166 • 126 127 136 • 150 152 146 154 156 164 114 30 Land Ownership Patterns in East Asia and the Emergence of Capitalism | Mr Liu's Opinions https://liamchingliu.wordpress.com/2018/12/28/land-ownership-patterns-in-east-asia-and-the-emergence-of-capitalism/ Equal-field system | Feudalism, Japan, Agriculture - Britannica https://www.britannica.com/topic/equal-field-system DECLINE AND FALL OF THE TANG DYNASTY | Facts and Details https://factsanddetails.com/china/cat2/4sub9/entry-7436.html Rentier state - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rentier_state Praecipitia in Ruinam: The Decline of the Small Roman Farmer and the Fall of the Roman Republic - Brewminate: A Bold Blend of News and Ideas https://brewminate.com/praecipitia-in-ruinam-the-decline-of-the-small-roman-farmer-and-the-fall-of-the-roman-republic/ Ninety years on from the Nazi ban on free trade unions, the lessons remain relevant to us today | TUC https://www.tuc.org.uk/blogs/ninety-years-nazi-ban-free-trade-unions-lessons-remain-relevant-us-today Enclosure - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure Combination Acts | Combination Laws, Trade Unions & Strikes | Britannica Money https://www.britannica.com/money/Combination-Acts The Tolpuddle Martyrs: the origins of trade unionism | The Gazette https://www.thegazette.co.uk/all-notices/content/100553 The Story - Tolpuddle Martyrs Museum https://www.tolpuddlemartyrs.org.uk/story The Case Against a Basic Income https://jacobin.com/2017/12/universal-basic-income-inequality-work The road from serfdom - Works in Progress Magazine https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-road-from-serfdom/ Emancipation reform of 1861 - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_reform_of_1861 No Representation Without Taxation?
