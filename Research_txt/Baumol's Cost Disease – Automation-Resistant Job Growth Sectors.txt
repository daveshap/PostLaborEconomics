Baumol's Cost Disease – Automation-Resistant Job Growth Sectors Introduction: Baumol’s cost disease describes how labor-intensive services with low productivity growth tend to experience rising costs and wages over time. In sectors like education, healthcare, or the performing arts, it still takes roughly the same human effort to deliver the service as decades ago – a teacher can only teach so many students at once, a string quartet still needs four musicians for one performance, a nurse can only care for a limited number of patients at a time. Meanwhile, productivity in other sectors (like manufacturing) has surged, pushing up economy-wide wages. To compete for workers, the “stagnant” sectors must pay higher wages despite not producing more output per person. The result is continually rising costs in services such as schooling, medical care, child care, live entertainment, policing, etc. , exactly as Baumol predicted . Paradoxically, these are often the very sectors where jobs have been growing and are likely to remain most resilient in the face of automation. The hypothesis is that the pain points of cost disease – where human labor remains essential and productivity gains are hard-won – highlight where the jobs of the future will stick around the longest or even thrive as AI and robots disrupt other fields. In other words, the roles that can’t easily be automated or scaled by technology are the ones driving labor demand (and wage pressure) today. In a post-labor-paradigm economy, recognizing these Baumol’s cost disease sectors can guide us to job opportunities that are most “automation-proof” , and warn which jobs might decline (for example, manufacturing or mining jobs have steadily vanished due to automation and efficiency, much like coal mining’s decline, whereas jobs in healthcare, education, and other personal services continue to expand). The sections below identify key job clusters characterized by cost disease dynamics – meaning demand (and costs) are rising because technology hasn’t eliminated the need for human workers – and examine why each is resistant to AI/robotic automation . Consumer prices in the U.S. since 1998 show services like college tuition and medical care (upper lines) climbing far faster than overall inflation, while goods like cars, furniture, toys, and TVs (lower lines) have gotten cheaper . This divergence reflects Baumol’s cost disease: labor-intensive services become more expensive relative to tech-driven sectors, indicating where human labor remains essential. 1. Healthcare and Social Assistance Healthcare is a classic example of Baumol’s cost disease at work. This sector’s productivity grows slowly compared to industries like manufacturing, yet wages and spending keep rising because we must pay more to attract and retain skilled caregivers . Over the decades, health expenditures have ballooned – for instance, in the U.S. healthcare went from about 5% of GDP in 1960 to nearly 18% today. As Baumol’s theory explains, medical services require intensive human labor that can’t be vastly sped up without risking quality . A doctor’s appointment or a surgery still takes a minimum amount of a professional’s time and attention, and a nurse can only tend to so many patients per shift. Technology has improved some procedures and diagnostics, but the core act of caregiving remains time-consuming. “Over the years doctors have managed to see more patients in less time by eliminating house calls, but even office visits require a certain minimum amount of time” – there is a limit to how far productivity can go when human interaction is the service. As a result, the cost of medical care rises faster than general inflation, and healthcare1 1 2 1 workers’ wages have had to rise in tandem with the broader economy. Indeed, decade after decade, healthcare prices have far outpaced average inflation , reflecting this imbalance. Critically, healthcare has also been one of the strongest job-growth sectors and is projected to remain so. With aging populations and increasing demand, healthcare and social assistance are expected to add more jobs than any other industry in the coming years . In the United States, for example, healthcare is forecast to add roughly 1.6 million jobs from 2023 to 2033, about 24% of all new jobs across the economy . Many of the fastest-growing occupations are in healthcare: nurse practitioners (who provide primary care) are projected to grow by an astounding 45% this decade, physician assistants by ~28%, and home health aides by around 34% . In fact, home health and personal care aides – the people caring for the elderly or disabled in home settings – are expected to have the single largest increase of any occupation, with over 820,000 new aide jobs projected by 2033 (more than double the next highest occupation) . This explosion in healthcare roles illustrates how urgently human labor is needed where machines cannot easily substitute. Why haven’t we automated more of healthcare? After all, modern hospitals use plenty of advanced equipment, and AI is making inroads in analyzing medical images, assisting diagnostics, or streamlining paperwork. But the human touch remains irreplaceable in most of this field. Caring for patients – whether performing a complex surgery, assessing a tricky diagnosis through nuanced symptoms, or simply providing comfort and communication at the bedside – requires a mix of technical skill, intuition, empathy, and adaptability to each individual. Robotics and AI have yet to master these holistic abilities. Surgical robots, for example, can assist a surgeon’s movements, but they are tools controlled by humans , not independent replacements for a surgeon’s judgment. Similarly, an algorithm might flag potential illnesses or suggest treatments from data, but a human doctor must interpret results, weigh ethical considerations, and earn a patient’s trust. Nurses and home caregivers perform physically and emotionally demanding tasks – from lifting or washing patients to talking them through fear and pain – that no current robot can genuinely replicate. Healthcare is fundamentally a “high-touch,” interpersonal service at its core , which is why it remains largely immune to full automation . As Vox journalist Timothy Lee noted, until we invent true “robotic doctors, nurses and professors,” we should expect health (and education) to keep getting more expensive relative to other sectors . So far , that prediction holds: despite waves of new tech, medical care still hinges on human providers , and thus the jobs keep growing. AI is helping with peripheral tasks (like scanning medical images or optimizing schedules), but it complements rather than replaces the central work of clinicians. In fact, rather than automating doctors away, AI often augments them – for example, an AI might rapidly read an X-ray, but a radiologist is still needed to confirm findings and discuss them with the patient. Automation resistance: Healthcare jobs rank among the most “AI-proof” due to several factors: they demand complex decision-making with high stakes, fine motor skills (for surgeons or dentists), and – importantly – social and emotional intelligence (bedside manner , patient education, counseling) that machines lack. The U.S. Career Institute analyzed dozens of occupations and found that medical roles dominate the list of jobs with essentially 0% automation risk ; fields like nursing, therapy, and counseling are extraordinarily hard to hand off to robots. Medical situations can be unpredictable and require human flexibility. For instance, an intensive care nurse might need to improvise when a patient suddenly deteriorates, or console a family – tasks needing human judgment and compassion. Moreover , patients generally resist the idea of being cared for entirely by machines. Trust and ethical comfort are big factors: few people want a robot delivering their baby or making end-of-life decisions for their loved one. All this means that healthcare roles are among the most secure and growing jobs in the automated1 3 3 45 6 7 7 2 future . Baumol’s cost disease is essentially a symptom of that security – we pay more for health services precisely because we cannot significantly automate them without losing quality. In a post-labor paradigm, healthcare workers (from doctors and nurses to home aides and physical therapists) are likely to remain in high demand, commanding rising wages as other jobs are displaced. Far from being made obsolete by technology, these professionals will more likely see technology working alongside them – e.g. AI assisting with charting or diagnosis – while the human role remains central. In short, as long as illness, injury, and aging are part of life, we will need human healthcare workers , and that makes this sector a reliable source of employment and wage growth . 2. Education and Training Education is another prime sector afflicted by Baumol’s cost disease – and one that exemplifies why certain jobs prove stubbornly resistant to automation. The basic model of teaching has not dramatically changed in productivity over the years: a teacher in the 2020s still spends roughly the same amount of time to effectively instruct a class or mentor a student as a teacher did decades ago . As one analysis colorfully put it, “it still takes four musicians nine minutes to perform Beethoven’s String Quartet… as it did in the nineteenth century,” and similarly a professor still needs to devote a semester to teach a course to a roomful of students. You cannot simply compress a rich educational experience into a faster , cheaper process without losing quality. Because teachers cannot significantly “speed up” their throughput (without, say, overstuffing classes or reducing interaction), productivity per teacher stays relatively flat . Yet to recruit and keep good educators, schools must offer competitive salaries – especially since graduates can earn more in other fields that have seen productivity (and wage) gains. This creates a cost spiral: any raise for teachers immediately raises per-student costs, since each teacher can only handle so much classroom load. Indeed, Baumol’s effect implies a growing wage gap between education and other industries, which many countries have observed: teaching salaries lag behind those of similarly educated professionals by 10–30%, making it harder to attract talent. If budgets don’t rise to fund higher pay, the result is teacher shortages and overwork – problems many school systems now face. In essence, education suffers from cost disease because the “labor is itself the end product” – the personal guidance of a teacher is fundamental to learning, and it can’t be mass-produced without dilution. Not surprisingly, the cost of education (especially higher education) has far outpaced inflation for decades. College tuition is the poster child: tuition and fees have ballooned several-fold in real terms since the 1980s, even as lecture halls and textbooks remain much like they were. Data confirms that education and childcare costs have risen much faster than prices of goods . This doesn’t necessarily mean inefficiency – it is often the inevitable outcome of low productivity growth in a service that people value. Parents and students are essentially paying for extensive human attention: smaller class sizes, more specialized courses, extracurricular mentoring, etc., all of which require more teachers or hours. And when budgets can’t keep up, we see the strain in the form of larger classes, fewer resources per student, and mounting teacher fatigue. The underlying dynamic is clear: so long as we rely on human teachers to educate, costs will tend to rise relative to other sectors , and so will the need for qualified educators. Why hasn’t technology replaced teachers? Over the past two decades, many have predicted that online learning, educational software, or AI tutors would revolutionize education and potentially reduce the need for teachers. While digital tools have certainly made some inroads (think of the rise of video lectures, learning apps, or AI-assisted grading), they have not eliminated the central role of human educators. In fact, despite the advent of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and various e-learning platforms, the demand for live teachers remains strong. The University of Michigan once envisioned reaching a million students via87 1 3 online courses in the 1990s; decades later , their MOOCs are available, but paying students “still want actual live teachers in front of them” and the recognized credentials that come with in-person education . The reason comes down to the unique value of human interaction in learning. A good teacher doesn’t just recite facts; they inspire, motivate, adapt to student feedback, and provide mentorship in ways that software cannot. As an analysis by UNESCO notes, education’s core service “cannot be easily accelerated or automated without sacrificing quality”. Advanced AI cannot conduct a nuanced class discussion, pick up on a shy student’s confusion and coax them out, or spark curiosity and creativity in the same manner a human teacher can. Moreover , much of teaching is about interpersonal connection – empathy, encouragement, discipline – which remains uniquely human. AI tools can help with administrative burdens (grading multiple-choice quizzes, organizing lesson plans, analyzing learning data) and thereby free up some of teachers’ time. However , these efficiencies don’t translate into needing fewer teachers; often, they just allow teachers to focus more on teaching itself. Each additional group of students still requires a human instructor’s oversight and personal feedback. Even the most sophisticated tutoring software works best as a supplement, with a teacher guiding its use and stepping in when students struggle. In short, technology so far has augmented educators, not replaced them – and there are diminishing returns to what can be automated before the educational experience deteriorates. As one report put it, teachers must handle “the essential educational aspects of interpersonal interaction” that AI cannot replicate. This explains why, even in an age of AI, we haven’t seen “robot professors” taking over lecture halls. If anything, teachers now also shoulder the work of integrating tech into lessons and supervising AI tools, which adds new responsibilities rather than removing the old ones. Automation resistance: Teaching and training jobs remain highly resistant to automation because they rely on complex human social skills. A recent World Economic Forum study observed that jobs emphasizing face-to-face communication and interpersonal empathy – with teaching highlighted as a prime example – are “likely to be unaffected or not significantly enabled by AI”. Most teaching tasks (explaining concepts, mentoring, providing tailored feedback) “feature prominently” among those not easily handed off to AI . This is borne out by expert analyses: educators are often listed among the jobs with extremely low automation risk. They require creativity, public speaking, emotional intelligence, and adaptability. No AI today can walk into a chaotic middle-school classroom and establish authority and rapport with students, or read the room and adjust a lesson on the fly. Likewise, one-on-one tutoring involves building trust and encouraging a student who may be frustrated or anxious – again, far beyond current machine capabilities. The necessity of human judgment in education is also reinforced by policy and ethics; for example, the U.S. Department of Education emphasizes that teachers must “exercise judgment and control” over the use of AI in class and that fully replacing teachers would betray a “fundamental misunderstanding” of their social role. Thus, teaching remains a person-to-person endeavor at its heart. Looking forward, demographics and social needs suggest teaching jobs will remain important. While the absolute growth in education jobs may be slower than healthcare (since it’s often constrained by public budgets), there is persistent demand for educators , and many regions are experiencing teacher shortages due to low pay and challenging conditions – evidence that we actually need more humans in these roles, not fewer . To the extent that Baumol’s cost disease flags where human labor is indispensable, education is a prime case: we either invest more in human teachers (accepting higher costs) or we see quality suffer . In a future with ubiquitous AI, human teachers might leverage AI tutors for drill practice or use virtual reality for simulations, but they will still be at the helm guiding students. Education jobs are thus relatively future-proof . They exemplify a broader principle: occupations centered on human development, mentorship, and care (of which teaching is one) hold their value in an automated age. As the UNESCO analysis concluded, even the most sophisticated AI can’t “radically increase [educational] 4 throughput without risking the loss of human connection and quality”. Therefore, teaching and training professions will likely continue to grow or at least remain stable, with rising wages needed to attract talent – a trend completely in line with cost disease theory. 3. Child Care and Elder Care (Personal Caregiving) Closely related to education are the caregiving professions – notably child care providers (daycare workers, nannies) and elder care or disability care workers (home health aides, personal care aides, nursing home attendants). These roles epitomize the combination of high labor intensity, growing demand, and resistance to automation that defines a Baumol’s cost disease sector . Child care in particular has become famously expensive for many families, often rivaling housing costs, yet the workers themselves are typically low- paid. The seemingly paradoxical high cost/low wage situation is explained by Baumol’s effect: caring for young children is intrinsically labor-intensive , and there’s a hard limit to how many children one caregiver can supervise without a decline in safety and quality. Regulations (and common sense) enforce certain adult-to- child ratios for health and safety – for example, a single daycare teacher can only handle perhaps 4–6 infants at once at most, no matter how high demand is. “In childcare…it’s difficult to automate, and obviously there’s a limit to how many children any one carer can safely look after,” as one analysis noted bluntly. Parents, quite reasonably, won’t accept a room of 20 toddlers per caregiver just to cut costs – they insist on a level of personal attention to keep their kids safe and nurtured. This caps productivity in the sector . As overall wages in the economy rise, child-care centers must pay their staff more to retain them (or else workers will leave for better-paying jobs), but each caregiver can’t correspondingly “produce” more childcare in the same hours. The outcome: childcare costs have relentlessly risen faster than inflation, straining family budgets. In high-income areas especially, the price of daycare is extremely high (often thousands of dollars per month), which is exactly what Baumol’s model would predict – wealthier societies will spend a bigger share of income on labor-intensive services like quality child care, since they can’t economize on the labor input. Indeed, data shows childcare tends to be least affordable in higher-income regions, reflecting the cost disease pattern that richer local economies bid up wages and thus childcare prices. The situation is similar with elder care : as lifespans increase and families seek assistance for aging relatives, the demand for home aides and care workers is exploding. But caring for an elderly person with medical or mobility issues is one-on-one work. Whether it’s helping them bathe, making sure they take medications, or simply providing companionship, a caregiver can only do so for a limited number of clients per day. There are efforts to use robots or AI (for example, companion robots or automated medication dispensers), especially in countries like Japan, but so far these are supplemental – we still need human hands and hearts in elder care . Consequently, elder care services are costly and often understaffed, and wages have had to rise to attract workers in a tight labor market. From a jobs perspective, personal caregiving is among the fastest-growing employment areas for the coming decade. We already noted that home health and personal care aides are projected to add more jobs than any other single occupation by 2033 – over 800k new positions in the US . This surge is driven by demographic realities (the large baby boomer generation requiring care) and the fact that these roles cannot be offshored or automated at scale. In fact, as of 2024, home health/personal care aide has become the largest occupation in the entire U.S. economy, with around 4 million workers , and it’s still growing fast. Yet despite the huge need, there’s a chronic shortage of care workers in many places. Low pay and tough working conditions make retention hard, which in turn forces wages upward as providers compete for scarce labor . This is classic cost disease: we must devote more resources (money, labor) to get the same level of personal care because we haven’t found a technological shortcut around the human requirement. 6 9 5 Why are child care and elder care so hard to automate? First, these jobs involve a high degree of emotional intelligence and human contact . A robot nanny or AI babysitter is not something most parents are willing to trust their infant with – even if a machine could change a diaper or warm a bottle, it couldn’t provide the comfort, bonding, and responsive interaction that children need for healthy development. Early childhood care is as much about hugging a crying toddler or singing a lullaby as it is about the procedural tasks. Similarly, for the elderly, care isn’t just administering meds; it’s listening to their stories, understanding their moods, and providing companionship to combat loneliness. These deeply human elements are not programmable. Second, even the physical tasks in caregiving are surprisingly complex: helping a frail person out of bed (while preventing injury) or keeping a squirming toddler occupied require fine motor skills and adaptive judgment. Robots currently lack the dexterity and gentle touch for such tasks – a caregiving robot would need to operate in unpredictable home environments, navigating clutter and handling delicate bodies, which is far beyond today’s robotics. We have seen some inventions (like mechanized patient lifts or feeding assistants), but they address only narrow aspects and still require a human caregiver to oversee or intervene. Third, there’s a trust and accountability factor . Care work often happens in private homes or closed settings where oversight is limited; families and regulators are uncomfortable removing human accountability from the equation. In the event of a medical emergency or an emotional crisis, people want a trained adult on hand, not just an algorithm. All these reasons mean that society isn’t prepared to hand off the care of our children, elderly, or disabled to machines – and likely won’t be for a long time (if ever). As one commentator quipped, nobody yet wants a robot nanny or nurse taking care of their loved ones . Automation resistance: Caregiving roles rank among the most automation-resistant of all jobs. They exemplify “high-touch” personal services that require empathy, trust, and adaptability. In lists of AI-proof occupations, childcare workers and elder aides consistently appear as low-risk , despite relatively low formal skill requirements, because the job is inherently human-centric. A robot could perhaps entertain a child for a while or monitor an elder’s vital signs, but it can’t replace the attentive presence of a caregiver that people desire. Moreover , these jobs often involve unpredictable scenarios – a baby might suddenly run a fever or an Alzheimer’s patient might become anxious and confused – where rote responses won’t do. Humans can improvise and comfort; robots cannot (at least not convincingly). The labor-intensive nature of these services is exactly why their costs rise (Baumol’s mechanism) but also why those doing the labor have enduring job security. Even as AI gets smarter , it’s hard to imagine an AI that parents would leave their infant with all day, or that could manage the myriad tasks an in-home aide does. Instead, what we’re seeing is AI and tech being used to assist caregivers – for example, apps that help caregivers track medications or sensors that alert if a senior falls. These tools can make caregivers more efficient or reduce some burdens, but they actually increase the demand for caregivers by enabling more people to live at home longer , etc. In other words, technology is augmenting, not replacing, the workforce here. Going forward, personal care jobs should remain a pillar of employment. They may not be high-paying unless policy changes (indeed one challenge is ensuring these essential workers get better compensation), but they are plentiful and not going away. In fact, they are likely to become even more important as other jobs shrink – it’s often suggested that caregiving and education roles will absorb workers displaced from automating sectors. Baumol’s cost disease hints that as society gets richer and automates manufacturing, more resources will shift into health, education, and care services. We see that happening: an ever-larger share of jobs are in caring and service roles. Thus, child care and elder care jobs are, in many respects, the jobs of the future – hands-on, one-to-one roles that robots can’t easily fill. 10 6 4. Public Safety and Law Enforcement Policing, firefighting, emergency response, and related public safety roles are another cluster where human labor remains indispensable and protected from full automation. William Baumol himself cited police and fire departments as examples of services that “require certain base levels of staffing” regardless of technology. You can buy fancier fire trucks or high-tech surveillance cameras, but you still need people – firefighters on the engine, police officers on the beat or responding to 911 calls – to provide the promised level of safety. The productivity of a patrol officer or a firefighter doesn’t double every few years the way manufacturing output might. A firefighter in 2025 can’t fight two fires at once any more than a firefighter in 1950 could; a police officer can’t be in two places simultaneously to respond to incidents. As cities grow and expectations of safety remain high, the number of personnel often has to grow too (or at least remain sufficient per capita). This is why the cost of public safety services tends to rise and put pressure on government budgets – their efficiency doesn’t increase dramatically, yet wages go up and communities expect adequate coverage. Indeed, government spending data shows that categories like law enforcement, fire protection, courts, and corrections have all grown over time, partly reflecting that Baumol dynamic. For example, many municipalities today spend far more (inflation-adjusted) on police and fire than decades ago, even if crime or fire rates have not increased, because the personnel are paid more and equipped better . In essence, public safety is labor-intensive and bound by Baumol’s logic : if other sectors’ wages rise, police and fire wages must also rise to attract qualified recruits, yet each first responder can only handle so many emergencies. There is no mass-production line for fighting fires or patrolling neighborhoods. From the employment perspective, public safety jobs have remained relatively stable or growing modestly. While not experiencing explosive growth like healthcare, these roles are continuously in demand. Communities rarely eliminate police or fire positions wholesale – if anything, there’s often political pressure to increase staffing for better safety (setting aside short-term fluctuations in funding). For instance, even as some tasks (like issuing traffic tickets) become automated through speed cameras, the core duties of policing (responding to violent incidents, investigations, community policing) still rely on humans. In firefighting, improved building codes and smoke alarms have reduced fire frequency, yet new challenges like wildfires or medical emergency calls (many fire departments handle EMT calls) have kept firefighters busy . Overall, these jobs aren’t disappearing; if anything, the skill requirements have gone up (modern police and firefighters need training in technology, social services, etc. in addition to traditional skills). Baumol’s cost disease suggests that paying for these services will keep straining budgets – for example, small towns struggle with the rising costs of maintaining a police force or ambulance service – but that’s because we cannot easily shrink the staffing without losing service quality. Why can’t we automate public safety? Science fiction is full of robo-cops and drone surveillance networks, and indeed technology has augmented public safety in many ways. We use CCTV cameras, drones, gunshot detectors, facial recognition software, data analytics for crime prediction – all forms of automation or AI applied to safety. However , these are aids, not replacements. When a crime is detected or an analysis predicts an incident, you still need human officers to engage with the situation. Law enforcement deals with complex social and ethical scenarios that are not routine or programmable: de- escalating an altercation, making a judgment call about using force, negotiating with a suspect, or earning the trust of community members. These require human judgment, empathy, and accountability. We are far from comfortable allowing AI to make life-and-death decisions in policing (and likely never will be, given the moral implications). Moreover , the unpredictable nature of emergencies makes full automation impractical. Each crime scene or disaster is unique – a robot would have to handle limitless scenarios, from a domestic dispute to a natural disaster , which is an unsolved problem in AI. We have seen experimental security robots 7 that patrol malls or parking lots, but they handle very narrow tasks (and even those have had high-profile failures, like falling into fountains or being easily foiled by pranksters). Real policing requires presence and adaptability that only people currently provide. The same goes for firefighting and rescue : robots can assist (for example, there are bomb-disposal robots or drones that can scout a burning building), but when it comes to pulling a person out of a burning house or giving CPR, human firefighters and medics are needed. Firegrounds are chaotic, with obstacles, heat, and the need for split-second problem-solving – robots would likely hinder more than help in such environments right now. Even something as routine as a medical 911 call needs human EMTs who can assess a patient’s condition and perhaps make a compassionate decision on treatment or transport. Another aspect is public trust and legitimacy . Policing in particular relies on community trust; people are policed by consent in democratic societies. It’s hard to imagine the public accepting fully autonomous police drones arresting citizens – that would raise legal and ethical nightmares about due process and accountability. Humans are expected to be answerable for the use of authority (hence body cameras, court testimony, etc.). An AI agent can’t testify to its reasoning in court in any satisfying way, nor can it be held accountable if it makes a grave error . This means that somebody – a human – has to be in the loop for critical public safety decisions. Automation resistance: Public safety jobs (police officers, detectives, firefighters, paramedics) rank as relatively automation-proof because of the combination of physical prowess, complex environment navigation, and social interaction they require. A police officer on patrol uses eyesight, hearing, and intuition to notice when something is “off” on a street corner – that kind of situational awareness in an open environment is extremely hard for AI, which excels more in controlled, well-defined settings. Firefighters perform intense manual labor (carrying hoses, climbing ladders, using tools to break down doors) in unpredictable conditions that robots (which are often fragile or inflexible) cannot handle. EMTs and paramedics need both medical knowledge and compassion to calm an injured person or make on-the-spot triage decisions. These roles also often involve teamwork – fire crews or police units coordinate in ways that leverage human communication and trust under pressure. Machines aren’t part of that social fabric. For these reasons, the core emergency response roles are expected to be among the last affected by AI or robotics . In analyses of government services under Baumol’s disease, it’s noted that services like law enforcement, courts, and education inevitably take up a growing share of budgets because they cannot harness labor-saving tech at the same pace as other sectors. In other words, society will keep investing human resources in these fields, and that implies stable employment. We should note that some tasks within public safety have been automated: e.g., automated ticketing for traffic violations, surveillance software reviewing video footage, or even AI systems to fill out incident reports. This can improve efficiency, but it doesn’t remove the need for human officers and responders ; instead, it shifts their focus to the more complex aspects of the job (which are precisely the aspects you can’t automate). If anything, technology in policing has created new roles (like cybercrime investigators, or police analysts who interpret data) which are themselves human jobs, just of a different nature. Going forward, one can imagine more use of drones for scouting dangerous situations (say, sending a robot into a hostage situation to relay info). However , when it comes time to actually resolve the situation or make contact, humans will step in. Thus, careers in public safety remain solid bets for being future-proof . They exemplify jobs where being hands-on and present in the real world is unavoidable. And consistent with Baumol’s hypothesis, we see wages and expenditures on these services climb over time – not because of waste, but because we have to pay people to do tough jobs that machines can’t do for us . For example, police and fire unions have secured decent wage growth (their members are often among the better-paid blue 8 collar workers), reflecting that these roles must keep pace with general wage trends to recruit personnel. All of this underscores how cost disease points to these jobs as sticking around. In a world of driverless cars and automated factories, we will likely still have police officers walking the beat and firefighters sliding down the pole for a call – just perhaps equipped with more tech tools than before. 5. Legal and Judicial Services The legal sector – including lawyers, judges, and courtroom staff – also shows traits of Baumol’s cost disease and has proven surprisingly resistant to automation so far . Legal services are highly customized, interpersonal, and often bound by precedent and procedure rather than mass production, making productivity gains slow. Baumol extended his theory to legal services as another example of a field where personal service is essential and thus costs keep rising . Think of a courtroom trial or a complex corporate deal negotiation: these processes require human deliberation, argumentation, and bespoke writing of documents. A lawyer in 2025 might use computer-assisted legal research instead of library books, but preparing a persuasive case or contract still takes many hours of skilled human effort. We haven’t seen law firms doubling their caseload handled per attorney in a decade; if anything, legal work has remained labor-intensive, with armies of lawyers and paralegals often needed for big cases. Accordingly, legal fees have climbed over the years (often outpacing inflation), and highly skilled attorneys command very high wages. Part of that is also a result of credentialism and monopoly (only licensed lawyers can do the work), but a Baumol effect is also at play: the economy’s overall prosperity pushes up what top lawyers can earn, even if their “output” (cases resolved per year) is relatively static. Government legal systems face similar issues – the cost of running courts and public defenders goes up, but you can’t simply automate court proceedings to save money (every defendant still gets a trial or hearing with human judges and attorneys). Why hasn’t AI replaced lawyers yet? In theory, law is information-based and might seem ripe for AI disruption. Indeed, there have been significant attempts: e-discovery software can sift through millions of documents faster than any human paralegal team (finding relevant evidence in litigation), and AI language models can draft basic contracts or summarize legal briefs. Some straightforward legal services (like drafting a simple will or basic contract templates) have been commoditized through online platforms. However , the heart of legal practice involves nuanced tasks that AI struggles with. Crafting a winning legal argument is not just about logic; it’s about persuasion – appealing to a judge or jury’s sense of justice, interpreting the subtleties of fact patterns, and outmaneuvering an opponent. That requires theory of mind and creativity that AI doesn’t possess. Each legal case can hinge on unique details and strategies ; a good lawyer must tailor their approach to the specific people involved (judge, opposing counsel, witnesses, jurors). AI, which lacks human experience, may miss the pragmatic and emotional aspects of a case. Furthermore, law is full of ambiguity and exceptions. Human judgment is needed to decide how statutes apply to new situations or to make equitable arguments. Judges, likewise, are not ready to defer their decision-making to a machine’s recommendation – they are entrusted by society to exercise human judgment and moral reasoning, something an algorithm can’t do in a transparent way. Also, the legal profession is inherently adversarial: if one side used an AI to craft arguments, the other side’s lawyers might find creative ways to rebut them that the AI didn’t anticipate. In other words, the law is a moving target with a human element . Another factor is trust and accountability , similar to policing. Clients typically want a human lawyer they can interact with, confide in, and hold accountable for advice. If an AI gives wrong legal advice, who is responsible? Until there’s a clear answer , people will prefer a human professional whose reputation is on the line. Additionally, many legal tasks bleed into policy and ethics – deciding whether to settle a case, whether10 9 a lawsuit is morally worth pursuing, etc., are decisions clients want a human touch on. So while AI will certainly change the practice of law (by handling routine drafting or research faster), it’s unlikely to eliminate the need for lawyers, especially at the higher end of complexity. Notably, “nobody (yet) wants a robot lawyer,” as was wryly observed . In fact, when a tech startup recently tried to have an AI “robot lawyer” assist a defendant in traffic court via an earpiece, it created an outcry and was shut down due to unauthorized practice of law concerns – highlighting both legal barriers and discomfort with non-humans in the courtroom. Automation resistance: Legal professionals (attorneys, judges, paralegals) enjoy a fairly strong insulation from automation because their roles involve advanced cognitive work, unpredictable human elements, and a heavy dose of communication. In lists of jobs and tasks, we do see some legal tasks as automatable – for example, document review for discovery or basic contract generation have high automation potential and indeed are being automated. This suggests that parts of lawyers’ jobs will be done by AI, possibly reducing the need for as many junior lawyers or paralegals in those areas. However , the core lawyering – advising clients, formulating case strategy, appearing in court – remains human . The legal field might evolve such that AI handles the drudge work and humans focus on high-level advisory and advocacy. Thus, the employment in legal services might shift in composition (fewer people doing rote paperwork, more doing client-facing analysis), but it’s not a field likely to see mass unemployment due to AI. Also, as long as regulations require a human with a law license to sign off on advice or to represent someone in court, those roles are protected. It’s worth noting that law is a credentialed profession that can self-regulate to some extent; the bar may simply not allow non-human practice. So there’s an institutional inertia keeping human lawyers central. From a Baumol’s perspective, legal services will probably continue to be expensive and in demand relative to other automated services. The cost disease signal here is that despite technology, legal costs haven’t plummeted – a complex litigation or a top lawyer’s hourly rate is as high as ever , if not higher . Clients often complain about hefty legal bills, but part of that is because you’re paying for skilled human time that can’t be easily sped up. Even if AI helps a lawyer work faster , often the lawyer will then handle more complex cases or simply meet rising demand (rather than charging much less). In sum, legal jobs – especially those requiring nuanced human judgment – are fairly robust . They might not grow as explosively as healthcare or personal care, but they are not disappearing. As society gets more complex, one could argue we need more legal interpretation (for instance, new laws around technology, or international law issues, etc.). So, law will continue to be a stable, if changing, field for human employment. The jobs that could be vulnerable (e.g. entry-level document reviewers) will likely morph into new types (like AI tool managers or legal technologists), still under the supervision of attorneys. The net effect is that lawyers and judges remain firmly in control of the legal system, with AI as a helper – thereby keeping the cost disease dynamic in play (human labor as the limiting factor). 6. Arts, Entertainment and Creative Professions The arts and creative industries offer a fascinating case of Baumol’s cost disease. This is actually where Baumol first noticed the phenomenon: performing arts, such as orchestral music or theater, have essentially zero productivity growth in the core activity – a Beethoven string quartet still needs four musicians onstage for 30 minutes to perform it, just as it did centuries ago. Yet, over time, we insist on paying those musicians more, because if we paid 18th-century wages, they’d quit and do something else in today’s economy. Thus, the cost of live performances (symphony concerts, plays, operas) tends to rise over time, often faster than general inflation. This is why tickets for live arts can be expensive and why many10 10 performing arts organizations struggle financially – their costs (mostly labor) keep climbing but it’s hard to raise productivity or find new revenue at the same pace. In fact, Baumol famously quipped that the performing arts will inexorably get more expensive and often need subsidy to survive. We have indeed accepted that maintaining an orchestra or opera company costs more every year and usually more than ticket sales alone can cover . The implication is that if we value live arts, society has to devote a growing share of resources to them, or else they dwindle – a pattern we see with many ensembles relying on donations, grants, and higher ticket prices to pay for rising salaries and expenses. It’s not just classical music. Across entertainment and creative fields, personal talent and time are key inputs that can’t simply be automated. Live concerts, Broadway shows, dance performances, stand-up comedy, fine art painting, film acting – each requires human artists to create and perform. While technology has changed distribution (e.g. recorded music, streaming, digital art tools), the creation still largely relies on human creativity and effort. For instance, making a movie still involves hundreds of people (actors, directors, crew) working long hours – budgets for films have soared over time, in part because expectations of production quality rise and you employ more specialists. Even with special effects technology, you end up employing teams of artists to craft those effects. In writing and journalism, historically each article or book took a writer’s time; productivity gains have been modest (though word processors and the internet helped research). However , unlike other sectors, in some creative realms technology has allowed some productivity or at least reach increases – e.g., a single recorded performance can be replayed millions of times (so the distribution productivity increased, but not the creation of the performance itself). Baumol noted this: television, radio, and recordings let one performance reach a huge audience . This has led to interesting economics in the arts: the emergence of superstar effects where a few artists can serve global markets (one pop star’s album sells worldwide). That doesn’t reduce the time the star spends in studio, but it massively scales the audience. This means not all artistic jobs grow; some mid-tier live performers lost ground as people consumed recordings instead. But new jobs in media production appeared. Still, the premium on live, in- person experiences has actually grown – people pay high prices for concert tickets or theater because the live aspect is valued and scarce. That again underscores how the uniquely human, un-automated nature of these experiences creates value . Why hasn’t AI replaced creatives? In recent years, AI has started encroaching on creative domains – AIs can now compose music, generate artwork, and even write essays or fiction to a degree. This is a new development that raises questions about the future of creative jobs. As of 2025, however , AI-generated art and music, while impressive, often lack the emotional depth, authenticity, or context that human artists provide. Audiences generally still flock to creations that have the human touch or vision behind them. For example, an AI can churn out a technically proficient painting or song, but it doesn’t have a story or intent that resonates in the same way as a human artist’s work (at least not yet). Moreover , art is inherently tied to human culture – people often want to know who the artist is, what they intended, and relate to the human experience expressed. A love song written by an AI that has never felt love might not satisfy the human listener’s need for genuine expression. In entertainment, personalities matter: fans want real human actors and musicians they can follow and connect with. Also, creativity tends to push boundaries in unpredictable ways, which AI (trained on past data) may not do on its own. Human creators introduce original ideas, while AI typically remixes existing patterns. We’ve seen AI do well in formulaic, high-volume content (like background music, or simple graphic designs), which could threaten some jobs (for instance, entry-level graphic design or stock music composers). But the11 11 highest levels of creative work – the conception of new genres, creation of beloved characters, performance that moves people – remain human-dominated . Audiences are not ready to attend a concert where a robot plays music with no human musicians, because part of the thrill is seeing human skill and emotion on display. Similarly, live theater with robot actors would lose the magic of human presence. Another angle: performing arts and sports and similar fields are as much about human excellence and connection as the output itself . We admire a ballet dancer’s years of training in each move, or an actor’s ability to cry on cue – knowing it’s a human doing these difficult things is integral to the value. If a robot did a perfect pirouette, one might say “well of course it can, it’s a machine” – the achievement is less meaningful to us. This psychology means that for a long time, human artists will hold a special place that audiences demand. In fact, the rise of digital media might make live, authentic experiences even more prized (as a sort of antidote to an AI-saturated virtual world). Automation resistance: Creative jobs occupy a somewhat mixed position in automation discussions. On one hand, they require originality, emotional intelligence, and often complex physical skill (in performance arts) – all things AI and robots find difficult. On the other hand, certain creative content generation is technically within AI’s reach (like composing music or generating images). The consensus so far is that truly creative and high-skill artistic roles are safer from automation than routine jobs , but creative industries will adapt by having humans work with AI tools. For instance, a graphic designer might use AI to generate ideas or rough drafts, then refine them, rather than doing everything from scratch. This means the nature of creative work might shift (more curation and editing of AI outputs), but the strategic and high- level creative decisions remain human. Indeed, in the list of “65 jobs with the lowest risk of automation,” musicians, artists, writers, and journalists are noted among the creative fields that demand human originality . Choreographers are a great example: they design dance routines that convey stories or emotions – it’s no surprise that choreographers are projected to grow ~30% by 2032, since no AI can yet invent a compelling new dance and coach humans to perform it. Similarly, jobs like “coaches and scouts” in sports, or directors in filmmaking are about motivating and guiding human talent, something automation can’t do. These niche creative and sports-related roles made the AI-proof list with strong growth percentages (e.g. coaches ~20% growth). We should acknowledge that automation may impact supporting roles in creative industries – e.g., some animators or video editors might be supplemented by AI – but the leadership and true artistic vision still comes from people. Also, new creative jobs are emerging (like digital content creators, influencers, etc.) that leverage technology but are fundamentally human-driven in personality. As cost disease logic would suggest, we might see costs and wages rise for the top creative talents (since they can’t be replaced), while more mundane creative output becomes cheap or free (AI making generic music). This bifurcation means being a distinctively human creative will be crucial – emphasizing the human storytelling and performance aspects that machines can’t mimic well. In summary, artistic and creative sectors remain one of the “last frontiers” of human employment where the unique value of human creativity and performance protects jobs. Baumol’s cost disease was first recognized here and still holds: live arts and bespoke creative work get relatively pricier , indicating how vital and scarce human creative labor is. As other jobs are automated, society may devote more attention and resources to arts and entertainment (people still crave culture, perhaps even more with more leisure time). Creative professions, especially those involving live audiences or original content creation, should thus continue to provide opportunities. They are not entirely immune to technological change (nothing is), but human creatives who can do what algorithms can’t – emotionally resonate and innovate – will 12 remain in demand . Even in a future with hyper-advanced AI, it’s likely that human art will have an irreplaceable aura simply because it is a window into another human’s mind, and that’s something a machine can never authentically offer . 7. Personal Services (Hospitality, Beauty, Fitness, etc.) This cluster includes a variety of personal services – jobs where a worker provides a direct service to an individual client, often one-on-one or in small groups. Classic examples are hairdressers and barbers, cosmetologists, massage therapists, personal fitness trainers, childcare workers (covered earlier), home cleaners, and food service workers like chefs or waitstaff in restaurants . These jobs usually require physical presence and tend to have limited productivity growth, fitting the Baumol profile. For instance, a barber can still only cut one person’s hair at a time with roughly the same 30 minutes to an hour per haircut that was required decades ago. There have been small efficiencies (electric clippers, online appointment scheduling), but nothing earth-shattering – you can’t automate the fine motor task of a perfect haircut on a human head easily. Thus, haircut prices rise over time as barbers’ wages rise in line with the general economy . Indeed, Baumol’s cost disease “explains why barbers make more in San Francisco than in Cleveland” today – in higher-productivity cities, even services like haircuts become pricier because labor costs more. The service is essentially the same, but the barber’s time is more expensive in SF’s booming economy than in a less booming one. Similarly, consider hospitality and food service: a hotel housekeeper still must clean each room one by one; a waiter still physically carries food to tables and interacts with customers; a chef still individually cooks dishes (even if using modern appliances). These tasks haven’t been radically sped up without affecting quality (fast food increased some efficiency in food prep, but at the cost of variety and ambiance; in full-service dining, people expect a certain pacing and experience). So restaurant meals and hotel stays have a significant personal labor component , and their costs have tended to go up. (Notably, “food away from home” – restaurant prices – have risen faster than grocery prices over the years , reflecting that eating out involves paying for human service). Another growing area is personal fitness and wellness services . Think of personal trainers, yoga instructors, coaches, nutritionists, or therapists (mental health counselors could fall here too). Many people are willing to pay a premium for one-on-one coaching in fitness or well-being. These interactions are inherently human – half the value of a personal trainer is the motivation, feedback, and accountability they provide, which a generic workout app can’t match for many folks. It’s telling that “fitness coaches” were explicitly listed by Baumol (via Vox) among the services likely to rise in cost in a high-tech world . Indeed, personal training and coaching jobs have grown as more of the population emphasizes health. They are labor-intensive (an hour of a trainer’s time per client session) and not automatable beyond providing generic routines. As long as clients want a human to cheer them on and correct their form, these jobs remain secure. Why are these personal service jobs hard to automate? First, most involve hands-on physical tasks that require dexterity and adaptation to individual preferences. Take cosmetology: giving someone a stylish haircut or makeup or a manicure requires fine motor skills, aesthetic judgment, and personal rapport. Robots struggle with the dexterity needed to handle something as varied as human hair – no two heads or desired styles are exactly the same, and a slight slip of scissors could ruin the cut or injure the customer . So far , we haven’t seen any credible “robot barber” that can do fades and shaves with the finesse of a human. Similarly, cleaning a cluttered home or hotel room involves identifying objects, moving furniture, reaching nooks – tasks that general-purpose robots find extremely challenging outside of very structured environments. There are vacuum robots for simple floor cleaning, but a robot housekeeper that truly1 13 replaces a human? Not in the foreseeable future. Each home or task tends to be unique and requires on- the-spot human problem-solving. Second, many personal services carry a social or emotional component . People often chat with their hairdresser or barber and derive social satisfaction from the interaction – a robot cutting hair silently (or with a canned voice) would turn an inherently human ritual into a cold transaction. The same goes for dining: part of a positive restaurant experience is the hospitality – a friendly waiter’s recommendations, a sommelier’s personal touch, a chef coming out to greet guests. Automating all of that would make it very efficient, yes, but much less appealing (some fast-food style eateries do minimize human interaction with kiosks and such, but in upscale or even mid-range hospitality, human service is a feature). Personal trainers and coaches absolutely rely on human connection; their ability to empathize and motivate is key. No matter how advanced an AI, it’s different when a real person says “You can do it, just one more rep!” and gives genuine praise. Humans respond to humans on an emotional level. Third, variety and personalization in these services defy one-size-fits-all automation. A tailor-made massage adjusting to your knots and tension, or a bespoke meal cooked to your taste by a chef, or a therapist responding to the nuances of your personal story – these are deeply personalized. AI might assist (e.g. an app can suggest workouts, or a chatbot therapist can do basic CBT prompts), but many people will still prefer human specialists for a tailored experience. And those who do use the automated versions are often those who wouldn’t or couldn’t pay for the human service anyway. Meanwhile, those who can afford it will continue to seek humans for premium service. From a job growth standpoint, many personal service occupations are growing steadily. For example, the U.S. Career Institute noted that jobs like hairdressers, cosmetologists, personal trainers, and coaches are among the common occupations with essentially zero automation risk . They also ranked several of these in terms of growth: athletic trainers and coaches are projected to grow ~17–20% this decade. Mental health counselors (a personal service in a sense) are projected up 22%. Even some artistic personal services like choreographers (who work directly with dancers) expect ~30% growth. These numbers reflect high demand as society places more emphasis on personal well-being, recreation, and experiences – exactly the sectors where human-centric work thrives. Automation resistance: In summary, personal service jobs are quite “future-proof” because they tick multiple boxes of automation resistance: they are manual, unpredictable, and people-facing . Whether it’s cutting hair , training a body, or serving a meal, these jobs happen in the real, physical world of human bodies and spaces, where AI and robots have the most trouble. They also often require building a one-on- one relationship (loyal customers who come back to the same hairstylist or trainer because of the personal rapport). That relational aspect is a moat against automation – you can’t download a relationship. Additionally, many personal service roles have low-tech entry but high skill in practice (a great barber or chef has years of tacit knowledge that isn’t easily codified). The result is that these jobs will continue to exist and likely grow as other parts of the economy churn. They might evolve – e.g., perhaps more use of scheduling apps, or gig-economy platforms for finding clients – but the fundamental work of human serving human will remain. Baumol’s effect tells us their prices will rise, which suggests those workers’ incomes can rise too, especially in prosperous areas. Already we see, for instance, upscale barbers and stylists in big cities earning very comfortable incomes because their service is in high demand and cannot be scaled up without hiring more humans (leading to boutique salons). Likewise, top personal trainers or private chefs can command high fees from clients who value that exclusive human service. Not every worker in these fields is well-paid (many struggle), but that’s often due to an oversupply of labor and low barriers to entry. 14 However , as other jobs disappear and more people need services, it’s possible society will revalue these roles more. In a far-future scenario, if advanced humanoid robots could cut hair or cook like a human, then these jobs might be threatened. But that requires enormous strides in general AI and robotics (to achieve human-level dexterity and aesthetic judgment). We are nowhere near that with current tech, which tends to excel in digital realms but flop in unstructured physical tasks. Therefore, personal service occupations remain a solid bet for human employment longevity . They highlight a general truth: tasks involving direct human physical interaction and tailored service are among the toughest for machines to do, and by extension, among the safest for workers. 8. Skilled Trades and Construction Skilled trades – such as electricians, plumbers, carpenters, HVAC technicians, mechanics – along with construction work form another cluster of jobs that have proven quite resistant to automation, despite involving manual labor . At first glance, one might think “manual jobs” would be the first replaced by machines (since we’ve seen robots in factories doing repetitive assembly). However , trades and construction work typically happen in dynamic, unstructured environments (homes, construction sites, varied equipment) and require on-the-spot problem solving – conditions where robots struggle. Over decades, the construction industry in particular has seen very low productivity growth , even stagnation, relative to manufacturing. In fact, studies show construction productivity in places like the U.S. has even declined in recent years. You still often have the same number of workers laying bricks or installing wiring in a house as you would decades ago, and it takes similar time. There have been improvements (power tools, prefabricated components), but not a radical transformation. Consequently, the cost of construction projects has soared faster than inflation in many regions – a phenomenon partly attributable to Baumol’s cost disease (and also other inefficiencies). As one analysis noted, American construction productivity has fallen while wages and costs have risen, meaning it takes more labor hours (and thus higher cost) to build infrastructure now than before. Some of this is due to choice (we demand more complex designs, safety standards, etc.), but also an inability to mechanize the fine tasks of building on-site. Skilled trade jobs are in high demand (even facing shortages) in many places today. Young people have often been pushed toward college instead of trades, resulting in an aging workforce of electricians, plumbers, and welders. Yet, society desperately needs these roles – you can’t maintain infrastructure, homes, and machines without them. The job growth in trades may not be explosive in percentage terms (since they’re smaller bases), but outlooks are generally stable or growing. For instance, the renewable energy buildout has specific trades (like wind turbine technicians, solar installers) which are among the fastest-growing jobs (60% growth for wind techs by 2033, as noted by BLS) . That shows how even in a tech-forward initiative (green energy), it ultimately comes down to people climbing turbines or wiring panels – very hands-on. More broadly, roles like electricians or plumbers are projected to grow or at least have tens of thousands of openings due to retirements. And wages in many trades are rising due to scarcity of skilled workers (e.g. a licensed electrician in a major city can earn a strong middle-class income, sometimes even six figures with overtime, which is far above what similar education-level jobs might pay in automated sectors). Why can’t robots do skilled trades? The reasons are similar to personal services but even more about adaptability: trades jobs happen in messy real-world settings and often require creative problem- solving . Take plumbing: every house or building can have a slightly different plumbing configuration, and1213 15 pipes might be in hard-to-reach places, old and corroded, etc. A plumber might have to crawl under a sink, feel around in murky water , figure out which part is leaking, and replace it using specialized tools – all in a tight space. Robots excel in controlled, repetitive tasks (like an assembly line where every piece is identical and fixtured precisely). But in a plumbing repair , nothing is identical; it’s a one-off situation. The robot would need phenomenal sensors, dexterity, and decision-making to handle even a simple home repair autonomously. We are nowhere near that level of general-purpose robotics. Electricians similarly pull wires through existing walls, troubleshoot why an outlet isn’t working (could be many causes), and ensure safety – a task mix requiring a human’s breadth of understanding and tactile skill. Construction workers operate in environments that change daily (a construction site evolves as the building goes up, with uneven terrain, moving obstacles, weather changes). They carry materials, align beams, pour concrete, install fixtures – varied tasks that require human coordination and flexibility. We do have machines for certain construction tasks (cranes, excavators, etc.), but those are operated by humans, essentially power tools on a grand scale. Fully autonomous construction robots exist mostly as prototypes (like a robot bricklayer , which can lay straight walls in a test setting, but on a real site still needs human oversight and can’t handle all the custom work like corners, arches, etc.). A critical point is that skilled trades often involve working in tight integration with the irregular human world . Robots currently “don’t have enough dexterity or motor control” to emulate what human tradespeople do with their hands. And they cannot easily account for the unpredictability of each job site. As a field service technology firm noted, human trades workers have the upper hand because every job is a little different , and robots can’t generalize well. Moreover , tradespeople often make judgment calls – how to fix something with available parts, how to meet code requirements which might need interpretation, how to minimize damage when accessing a problem area. These are not binary decisions an AI can just calculate; they involve practical wisdom and sometimes creative improvisation. Automation resistance: Skilled trade jobs rank very low in automation risk for all these reasons. They combine physical skill, problem-solving, and often customer interaction (a plumber discussing options with a homeowner , or a mechanic explaining a car issue). In analyses of automation, jobs like plumbers, electricians, carpenters, mechanics, HVAC techs, etc., are commonly cited as safe. One Reddit commentary summed it up: “Most tradespeople (electricians, plumbers, repairmen, construction, pest control, landscapers, etc.)” are not easily replaced by AI or robots. A more formal take from industry experts: robots lack the dexterity and adaptability to perform trade jobs, and ultimately those machines will still require human maintenance and oversight . In fact, as automation and AI tools are introduced, they often increase efficiency and safety for tradespeople rather than eliminate them – for example, an augmented reality (AR) headset might help a technician visualize wiring behind a wall, or a big data system might help schedule maintenance proactively. These technologies allow a skilled tradesperson to be more productive, but you still need that person’s hands and brain on the job site. There’s even an argument that adoption of tech in trades could create more jobs (someone has to manage the tech, plus if things get cheaper to build, people will build more, requiring more labor). In many ways, skilled trades and construction might be among the very last work domains to be fully automated , if it ever happens. They represent a moving target for AI: the tasks are not done in a static factory but out in the wild, which is infinitely variable. Perhaps extremely advanced general-purpose humanoid robots could one day do these jobs, but that’s the realm of science fiction for now. Until then, societies will rely on human trades workers to keep infrastructure functioning and build the homes and facilities we use – and they will pay a premium for these skills when they become scarce. We see evidence of Baumol’s effect here: for example, the cost of infrastructure projects has gone up in part due to high labor 16 costs (often unionized labor in trades). That’s not purely Baumol’s disease (there are inefficiencies too), but it aligns with the idea that these sectors haven’t had productivity boosts to offset wage increases . So we pay more for construction, but we get better-paid construction workers (and sometimes just more of them per project). For young people considering careers in an automated world, trades are often recommended as a safe path. They require intensive training and apprenticeship, but once skilled, these workers are in demand and relatively shielded from the white-collar automation wave (like AI taking over routine office tasks). As one manufacturing CEO quipped, “we can automate the production line, but we still need a guy to come fix the robot when it breaks” – that maintenance tech is a tradesperson who isn’t going anywhere. Indeed, the more automation spreads, the more skilled technicians we need to maintain the robots and systems . It’s a paradox that Baumol’s theory also allows: some sectors can indirectly create new human-intensive tasks even as others automate. So, skilled trades and construction stand out as robust job sectors in the face of AI and robotics – they’re a pillar of the “post-labor” economy in the sense that they’ll labor on even when other jobs vanish. General Principles and Future Outlook: Having examined these clusters – healthcare, education, care work, public safety, legal, creative arts, personal services, and skilled trades – we can distill some common themes. Baumol’s cost disease has essentially spotlighted the types of work that remain stubbornly human-intensive . These are often the jobs of the future precisely because they resist automation. From these examples, several general principles emerge about what makes a job robust against AI and robots : Deep Interpersonal Interaction is Irreplaceable: Jobs that revolve around human-to-human interaction – caring for people’s health or education, providing personal services, negotiating or counseling – tend to be safe. They require emotional intelligence, empathy, persuasion, and relationship-building that AI cannot replicate effectively. A teacher inspiring a student, a nurse comforting a patient, a hairstylist chatting with a client, or a lawyer convincing a jury all leverage uniquely human connection. These “high-touch” roles, often involving one-on-one or one-to-few dynamics, appear to be where humans will retain an edge indefinitely. We see that virtually every sector with cost disease has a strong interpersonal element (healthcare, education, arts, hospitality, etc.). As technology advances, the relative importance of the human touch may even grow – when everything else is automated and impersonal, people will especially value genuine human interaction. Unpredictable Physical Environments Favor Humans: Jobs that take place in the physical world, especially in varied or uncontrolled settings, are extremely hard to automate. Robots excel on factory floors or in cyberspace, but in homes, streets, and outdoor sites with irregular conditions, humans outperform machines . This is why skilled trades, emergency responders, and many service jobs remain human. They require mobility, dexterity, and sensory awareness in ever- changing environments – something current AI and robotics struggle mightily with. A plumber adjusting to a quirky pipe layout, or a firefighter navigating a collapsing building, shows the adaptability that only humans currently bring. Until robots gain not just agility but the intuition to handle surprise situations, any job with lots of real-world, unscripted activity is relatively safe . This principle covers a huge range: from construction labor to cleaning, from delivery work in chaotic city traffic (though self-driving tech aims at this) to event planning. In essence, if a job happens outside the neatly organized data or assembly line domain, it’s probably safer .• • 17 Creativity and Complex Decision-Making: Jobs that demand coming up with new ideas, strategies, or designs – or making complex decisions with limited rules – are hard for AI. This includes high-level professional work (like devising a legal strategy or a scientific hypothesis) and artistic creation. While AI can churn content and even suggest decisions based on patterns, it lacks true originality and cannot handle ambiguity or conflicting objectives like a human decision-maker can. We saw this with creative arts and certain aspects of legal and management work. When there is no clear “right answer” and a need for innovation or ethical judgment, humans are still the go-to. As AI gets better at routine optimization, humans will focus on the fuzzy problems and creative leaps that machines can’t reliably do. Thus, jobs emphasizing creative problem-solving, strategic thinking, and innovation (from entrepreneurs to novelists to clinical diagnosticians) maintain a robust outlook. One-on-One and “Hands-On” Work Endures: A recurring phrase has been one-on-one or hands-on . This captures the jobs where a provider is physically and attentively present with a client or task – a scenario that doesn’t scale well with tech. A therapist talking to a patient, a masseuse treating a client’s muscles, a tutor coaching a student, a repair tech fixing a specific broken machine – these situations are all bespoke and hands-on. They usually have to be done individually, not batch- processed. Such work inherently resists the scale efficiencies that automation brings , which means it also resists being taken over by a single AI or robot doing it for everyone. If anything, technology might assist these professionals (like scheduling apps or diagnostic tools), but the core one-on-one engagement remains. This principle is essentially Baumol’s insight: where the service is delivered per person by a person, productivity doesn’t leap ahead, so those jobs don’t disappear . Instead, their economic share grows. High Trust, High Accountability Roles: Many of the robust jobs involve areas where society is cautious about entrusting machines with full control – health, safety, justice, personal wellbeing, etc. There is a trust factor: we prefer a human we can hold accountable and who can explain decisions in human terms. For example, we want doctors, not black-box algorithms, to tell us what treatment we need (even if the AI helps behind the scenes). We want a human pilot on the plane even if autopilot handles most flying, because in an emergency we trust human judgment. These kind of roles (pilots, doctors, judges, etc.) will likely remain human-led until or unless AI can demonstrate superhuman reliability – and even then, social acceptance may lag. Thus, jobs where human responsibility is crucial and expected will be among the last automated . On the flip side, recognizing these principles also highlights which jobs are more vulnerable: work that is routine, repetitive, and doesn’t involve personal interaction or physical dexterity in open environments is easiest to automate. Many manufacturing and administrative jobs fell into that category and have indeed been automated in recent decades (or moved to lower-cost labor until automation catches up). Data processing, number crunching, and predictable manual tasks (like assembly of standardized products) are classic automation targets. In contrast, the jobs we’ve focused on have intrinsic variability or humanity that shield them. Looking ahead, it’s possible that Baumol’s cost disease sectors will continue to expand their share of employment . As manufacturing, mining, and even some white-collar process jobs get taken over by AI/ robots, the economy shifts workers into healthcare, education, services, and trades – precisely because those need people. This is already happening: over the last half-century, employment has shifted dramatically towards services and away from goods production. That trend is expected to continue. We might end up with a workforce heavily concentrated in caring, creative, and technical maintenance roles,• • • 18 supported by an automated infrastructure producing goods efficiently. In such a scenario, the cost disease isn’t so much a “disease” as a reallocation of wealth – society choosing (or being forced) to spend more on human-provided services. Baumol himself argued that as we grow richer , we can afford these rising costs if we prioritize them. In other words, paying a higher share of GDP for health, education, etc., is a natural outcome of technological progress elsewhere, and it may be a good problem to have as long as we manage it wisely. Finally, it’s worth noting that resilience in the face of automation doesn’t mean these jobs are easy or free of challenges. Baumol’s cost disease sectors can suffer from underinvestment, worker shortages, and affordability crises (e.g., childcare and healthcare being too expensive for many). The hope would be that recognizing their importance leads to policies that support these fields – investing in training more caregivers and teachers, raising their wages (which ironically exacerbates cost disease in the short run but may be necessary), and using technology thoughtfully to assist them without replacing the human core. In conclusion, Baumol’s cost disease acts as an early indicator of which jobs are built to last . The more a job’s value derives from uniquely human labor that can’t be sped up by machines, the more its relative cost rises – signaling both a challenge (rising prices) and an opportunity (strong demand for workers). The clusters discussed above each illustrate that dynamic. Sectors like healthcare, education, personal care, public safety, and skilled trades are experiencing growing demand and wages because they remain automation-resistant . These fields, often labeled “stagnant” in productivity, may ironically become the backbone of the future labor market. They are where humans will continue to find work that machines can’t do, at least not with comparable quality or acceptance. Therefore, if one is charting a career in a post-labor- paradigm world, focusing on roles that involve human touch, creativity, and adaptability – essentially, roles identified by cost disease – is a strategic bet . While no job is entirely immune to change, those that center on caring for others, engaging directly with the world’s unpredictability, and harnessing human ingenuity are as close to “future-proof” as it gets. In short, the cure for individual workers to the threat of automation may well lie in the very sectors that economists long dubbed “diseased” – because it turns out, in those cases the cure is the human touch, which has no technological substitute .
