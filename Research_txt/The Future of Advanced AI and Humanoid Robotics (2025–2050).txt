The Future of Advanced AI and Humanoid Robotics (2025–2050) Advanced AI: Trajectory Through 2050 Advanced artificial intelligence – especially generative AI models, transformers, and deep learning systems – is on a rapidly accelerating development path. Over just the past decade, AI capabilities have grown exponentially due to massive increases in model size, data, and computational power . For example, between 2012 and 2018 the training compute for leading AI models increased by 300,000× , roughly doubling every 3–4 months . In fact, a mere five years and a 10,000× jump in compute separate the “barely coherent” GPT-2 model (2018) from today’s powerful GPT-4 (2023) – a dramatic leap that showcases how fast AI performance is improving. Moving forward, experts widely anticipate that this trend will continue (albeit possibly at a slightly moderated pace), enabling AI systems to tackle increasingly complex tasks and approach human-level cognitive abilities in the coming decades. Rapid Progress in AI Capabilities Fueled by scaling and innovation, AI systems are improving at an extraordinary rate . Large transformer models with hundreds of billions of parameters are already exhibiting surprising emergent abilities in language understanding, image generation, problem-solving, and more. The driving factors – algorithms, data, and compute – have all advanced in tandem: researchers note that training compute for state-of-the- art models grew 10 billion-fold since 2010 (doubling roughly every 5–6 months) . This exponential growth in resources has yielded qualitatively new capabilities. Modern generative models can produce human-like text, code, images, and even pass professional exams , blurring the line between narrow AI and more general intelligence. Many AI researchers now believe that with further scaling and refinement, artificial general intelligence (AGI) – AI with broad, human-level cognitive ability – is plausible within the next few decades. Surveys of AI experts consistently put a 50% probability of AGI emerging around the 2040s , with some optimistic forecasts targeting even the 2030s . In short, if current progress continues, advanced AI systems are expected to become vastly more capable by 2030, 2040, and beyond, potentially matching or exceeding human performance across a wide range of tasks. However , this rapid advancement is not guaranteed to be smooth or linear . New paradigms and breakthroughs may be required to sustain the pace. Recent reports indicate that simply scaling up existing architectures is beginning to yield diminishing returns – models are improving more slowly than before despite added size . As one AI CEO noted, current models seem to be “ converging at the same ceiling on capabilities ,” suggesting an approaching plateau under the present methods . In response, researchers are actively exploring novel techniques (for example, “test-time compute” that allows AI models to think longer on hard problems) to push beyond these limits . Data is another crucial factor: training today’s giants consumes trillions of words scraped from the internet. One analysis estimates about 300 trillion tokens of high-quality text exist publicly, and at the current rate, top language AIs might exhaust this data stock by 2026–2032 . This implies that data scarcity could soon constrain AI scaling, necessitating strategies like generating synthetic data or improving sample efficiency. In a 2025 expert1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 survey, 76% of AI researchers felt that purely scaling up current approaches (like bigger transformers) is unlikely to achieve AGI – indicating that new algorithmic ideas or hybrid techniques will be needed to reach the next level of intelligence. In summary, while advanced AI is improving rapidly, researchers acknowledge important technical challenges (diminishing returns, data limits, and the need for new algorithms) that must be overcome to sustain progress on the road to human-level and super-human AI. Integration and Adoption Trends Equally striking to the technical progress is the explosive uptake of AI in real-world use . Cutting-edge AI is being deployed at a breakneck pace across industries, enabled by its increasingly general capabilities. The rise of generative AI in particular has led to unprecedented adoption by end-users. For instance, OpenAI’s ChatGPT (a large language model-based chatbot) reached 1 million users in just 5 days – a record growth rate – and surpassed 100 million users within two months of its late-2022 debut . By mid-2025, ChatGPT’s website was attracting billions of visits per month , as individuals and businesses rushed to integrate AI assistants into daily work. This example illustrates how quickly advanced AI can move from research labs to mass deployment. Organizations worldwide are rapidly embracing AI capabilities. Surveys indicate roughly one-third of organizations are already using AI , and another ~40% are actively exploring or piloting AI solutions . In a recent global poll, 87% of companies agreed that AI will give them a competitive edge over rivals , underscoring the strong incentive to adopt. Key adoption metrics and forecasts include: Market Growth: The global AI market (software, hardware, services) is projected to reach about $1.8 trillion by 2030 , growing at an annual rate of ~35% in the latter 2020s . This is roughly a five- fold increase from its ~$390 billion value in 2025 . Generative AI alone could drive over $1 trillion in annual economic impact by 2030, according to some estimates . Economic Impact: Analysts forecast that AI could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 through productivity gains and new products . This would represent a sizable ~26% boost to global GDP, reflecting AI’s potential to transform industries at scale. Workforce & Productivity: While AI will automate certain job tasks, it is also creating demand for new roles. By 2025, it’s estimated that AI could lead to a net increase of about 12 million jobs globally (with ~85 million jobs displaced but ~97 million new ones created) . In the workplace, employees leveraging AI report significant productivity improvements (often 20–80% gains in output) . Many professionals are now using tools like coding assistants, AI content generators, and decision support systems as part of their daily workflow. Ubiquitous Integration: By 2030, AI is expected to be deeply integrated into virtually all sectors – from healthcare diagnostics to customer service chatbots, manufacturing optimization, finance, education, and beyond. A PwC analysis found that 77% of companies can be classified as current or imminent AI adopters . Everything from smart personal assistants and self-driving vehicles to intelligent infrastructure will become more common as AI continues to mature and spread. In summary, AI adoption is scaling rapidly in the mid-2020s and shows no sign of slowing. The combination of technological advancement and strong economic incentives suggests that by the 2030s, AI will be a foundational technology embedded in most business processes and consumer applications. The10 11 12 13 14 • 15 16 1718 19 • 20 • 21 22 • 23 2 world is effectively moving toward widespread reliance on AI for enhanced decision-making, automation, and innovation. Long-Term AI Forecasts (2025–2050) Looking further out, experts predict dramatic strides in AI capability between now and 2050 , though opinions vary on the exact timeline. A growing number of AI researchers believe that artificial general intelligence – an AI that can understand or learn any intellectual task a human can – could be developed in this period. In aggregated surveys of hundreds of researchers, the median estimate for a 50% chance of achieving high-level machine intelligence falls around 2040–2050 . In other words, many in the field think there is even odds that by the mid-2040s, we’ll have AI systems as generally smart as the average person. Optimistic tech leaders (especially in industry) foresee AGI sooner , perhaps in the 2030s , while more skeptical experts caution it might take until late in the century – but very few dismiss the possibility altogether . Notably, once human-level AI is achieved, most experts expect an acceleration to super- intelligent AI (far beyond human level) in short order – potentially within just a few years to decades after AGI . This is because advanced AIs could help improve themselves, leading to rapid iterative progress. By the 2050s , it is conceivable that AI systems may vastly exceed human cognitive performance in virtually all domains, from science and engineering to creative arts. Concrete predictions along the way include AI mastering more and more domains of expertise. For example, one 2019 expert survey estimated a 50% chance that AI will be capable of outperforming humans in most economically important tasks by roughly 2060 . By the 2030s, AI is expected to handle many forms of routine knowledge work (such as basic accounting, customer support, data analysis) and even complex tasks like driving vehicles or diagnosing illnesses at least as well as humans. As early as 2030, experts anticipated AI would likely automate jobs like call center operators, truck drivers, and retail salespeople to a significant degree . As we approach 2040 and beyond, AI’s role could shift from narrow job automation to more general problem-solving and research – for instance, AI scientists contributing to major scientific breakthroughs or AI-powered tutors providing personalized education at scale. By 2050, in many outlooks, AI is ubiquitous and essential : an invisible infrastructure running businesses, governments, and daily life, optimizing systems and even tackling challenges like climate modeling or drug discovery in ways no human team could. All that said, it’s important to acknowledge uncertainty in these forecasts – the exact trajectory of AI progress remains hard to predict . Breakthroughs (or obstacles) can surprise even experts. Nonetheless, the overall consensus is that the next 25 years will bring AI systems that are orders of magnitude more powerful and capable than today’s, with transformative impacts on society and the economy. Barring unforeseen setbacks, advanced AI in 2050 could potentially operate with reasoning and learning abilities on par with, or surpassing, human intelligence , fulfilling many long-standing sci-fi predictions. Researchers are actively working to ensure such powerful AI remains safe and beneficial, so that the optimistic visions of human-AI collaboration and amplified human productivity can be realized, rather than the dystopian outcomes sometimes feared. In summary, the 2025–2050 horizon for AI points to extraordinary technical growth – from today’s early generative AI tools to tomorrow’s potentially super-intelligent machines – that will redefine what technology can do.4 5 24 25 26 27 3 Humanoid Robotics: 2025–2050 Outlook Humanoid robots, such as Tesla’s Optimus prototype (pictured), are advancing rapidly. These bipedal robots are designed to eventually work alongside humans in factories, warehouses, and even homes, leveraging AI to perform a wide range of tasks. The field of humanoid robotics – robots with human-like bodies and behaviors – is poised for a revolution in the coming decades. Unlike traditional single-purpose industrial robots, humanoids combine advanced AI “brains” with a versatile human-shaped form, allowing them to operate in environments built for people. As of the mid-2020s, we have seen impressive prototypes like Boston Dynamics’ Atlas , which can run, jump, and manipulate objects with uncanny agility, and Tesla’s Optimus , which aims to leverage AI to handle delicate tasks (e.g. picking up eggs without breaking them) . While these systems are still under active development, progress has been faster than many expected – and industry analysts predict humanoid robots will transition from research labs to common deployment in the next 5–10 years . Below we examine how quickly their capabilities are improving, what technical limits remain, how fast they might be adopted, and forecasts for 2030 through 2050. Advances in Robot Capabilities and Performance The capabilities of humanoid robots are improving at an accelerating pace , thanks to advances in mechanical design, artificial intelligence, and cost reduction. Recent models can do far more than early predecessors: today’s humanoids can walk on two legs , keep their balance over rough terrain, lift and carry objects , and perform simple hand manipulation. Researchers have identified several converging factors that are driving rapid improvements: Human-Level Mobility and Dexterity: Robotic locomotion and balance control have advanced to near-human levels. State-of-the-art humanoids can walk, run, jump, and navigate complex environments without toppling. Likewise, their arms and grippers are gaining fine motor skills – approaching the dexterity needed for tool use and delicate tasks . For example, robots like Atlas demonstrate agile whole-body movements, and newer designs incorporate multi-fingered hands capable of grasping varied objects. Simplified Training and Control: Breakthroughs in AI are making it much easier to teach robots new tasks . Rather than hard-coding every action, engineers can now use natural language or demonstration to instruct a robot. Advanced robots leverage language models and imitation learning , so an untrained person could one day tell a robot, “follow me and carry these boxes,” and the robot can understand and execute it. This reduces the need for specialized programming; managing robots begins to feel more like managing human workers . Rapidly Falling Costs: The cost of building humanoid robots is plummeting , moving toward economically viability. Between 2022 and 2024 alone, the average unit cost dropped by at least 40% . One example is Unitree’s bipedal robot costing around $16,000 – roughly equivalent to a year’s wages for a human worker in the U.S. . Analysts expect costs to continue falling as production scales; Bank of America projects the price of a humanoid could be about $35,000 in 2025, dropping to ~$17,000 by 2030 . Such price trends mean that within a few years, owning a general-purpose robot could be as affordable as buying a car , making it feasible for businesses (and eventually households) to deploy robots at scale.2829 30 • 31 • 32 • 33 33 34 4 AI-Powered General Intelligence: The integration of advanced AI is giving humanoid robots increasingly autonomous and adaptive behavior . Recent robots come equipped with powerful on- board computers and are connected to cloud AI services, allowing them to perceive their surroundings and make complex decisions in real time. Especially significant is the use of generative AI and large language models to provide a form of general intelligence for robots . This means a robot isn’t limited to a fixed set of pre-programmed routines – it can analyze visual inputs, understand spoken commands, and respond to unexpected changes in its environment with appropriate actions. In effect, the same AI breakthroughs driving virtual assistants are being transplanted into physical robots, greatly expanding their versatility and usefulness. Crucially, these improvements are happening simultaneously , and their combined impact is bringing humanoid robots to an inflection point . According to tech consultancies, dexterous, bipedal robots with sufficient intelligence will be able to perform a wide range of physical jobs at a cost equal or lower than human labor within about five years . Tasks that were previously impossible for robots – like stocking shelves, preparing meals, or assisting a person out of bed – are becoming realistic as prototypes rapidly improve. In short, the gap between what a human can do with hands, feet, and senses versus what a robot can do is narrowing year by year . If this trajectory continues, the 2030s will see humanoid robots achieving human-like performance in many manual and service tasks , working safely and effectively in environments designed for people. Deployment and Adoption Trajectory Given these advances, how fast will humanoid robots be adopted in the real world? All signs point to an accelerating deployment over the next couple of decades, especially as costs drop and capabilities reach commercial viability. As of 2025, humanoid robotics is where personal computing was in the late 1970s or electric cars in the early 2010s – on the cusp of rapid growth. Already, we see significant investment flowing in: global funding for humanoid robot startups jumped from about $308 million in 2020 to $1.1 billion in 2024 . Several major tech companies (e.g. Tesla, Xiaomi) and specialized startups (e.g. Agility Robotics, Figure AI) are ramping up prototype production and setting up pilot programs . For instance, Agility Robotics has built a factory aiming to produce 10,000 units of its humanoid (called Digit ) per year , after strong demand from warehouses and logistics firms . Likewise, Tesla’s Optimus project, announced in 2021, aims to leverage the company’s manufacturing prowess to eventually mass-produce humanoids for factory and home use. These early efforts suggest a future where robots are produced in the millions of units annually, akin to cars or smartphones. Analysts predict a steady start, then a sharp takeoff in adoption. Bain & Company anticipates steady growth through 2030, followed by a rapid uptick thereafter as the technology matures and proves its value. Multiple forecasts suggest an economic “tipping point” around the early 2030s. In fact, Bank of America analysts project that by 2030 global humanoid robot sales could reach 1 million units per year , as robots move from pilot projects to wide commercial use . With support from tech giants and falling costs, BofA writes that humanoids are likely to shift from “proofs of concept to multi-industry adoption by the end of the decade” . Early adopters are expected to be sectors facing labor shortages or dangerous work conditions – for example, manufacturing, warehousing, construction, and healthcare. The U.S. and China are leading the charge in humanoid R&D and deployment, with the U.S. driven largely by private tech companies and China by government-backed initiatives to automate manufacturing .• 35 30 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 5 Going into the 2030s, adoption could snowball as capabilities improve. Humanoids are inherently general- purpose, so once they become cost-effective, the addressable market is enormous. Forecasts for 2035 vary, but the market size is estimated anywhere from $38 billion up to $200+ billion by 2035 , depending on how quickly production scales. A major bank (UBS) recently predicted the global humanoid robot population could exceed 300 million by 2050 , with annual sales around 86 million units per year by 2050 (implying a ~40% compound annual growth for the next 25 years) . To put that in perspective, that would mean roughly one humanoid robot for every 20 people on the planet by mid-century. Even more aggressively, tech CEO Elon Musk has speculated there could be “maybe over a billion humanoid robots” in the 2040s serving various roles – essentially, a potential scenario where robots become as ubiquitous as cars or smartphones are today. The expected deployment timeline goes from industry to home. Through the late 2020s and early 2030s, we should see humanoids increasingly common in factories, warehouses, and other controlled environments . By the mid-2030s , experts predict these robots will make significant inroads in manufacturing and logistics, working alongside humans on assembly lines, moving goods, and performing repetitive labor . As one example, Amazon has already deployed bipedal warehouse robots (like Agility’s Digit) to tote packages and assist human pickers . After 2035 , as technology improves further (and costs fall more), humanoids are expected to expand into service industries and public settings – think robots cleaning commercial buildings, stocking store shelves at night, delivering room service in hotels, or assisting nurses in hospitals . Finally, in the 2040s and 2050s , humanoid robots may become common in households and everyday life, helping with cooking, cleaning, gardening, and caregiving . This progression – industry first, then services, then homes – mirrors how other advanced technologies (like computers or internet) initially spread. It’s also a recognition that the home environment is the most challenging (unstructured and full of random variability), so widespread personal/home robot adoption is likely to be the last stage, developing through the 2040s as robots achieve the necessary sophistication . In terms of raw numbers and economics : if these trends hold, by 2040–2050 we could have tens of millions of humanoid robots entering the workforce annually . The market value of these machines and their services is projected around $1.5–2 trillion by 2050 , comparable to the current global auto industry. Many of these robots will effectively add to the labor force, working 24/7 (one robot can do the work of multiple full-time humans due to continuous operation ). This could significantly boost productivity in aging societies that face human labor shortages . In sum, the deployment outlook for humanoid robots from 2025 to 2050 is one of rapid expansion – starting slowly in niche areas, but potentially reaching ubiquitous adoption in virtually every sector and region by mid-century. Technical Challenges and Limits Despite the optimistic trajectory, formidable technical challenges remain before humanoid robots can truly match human versatility. These challenges represent the “upper limits” that current technology has not yet surpassed, and they will shape how quickly and in what roles robots proliferate. Key hurdles include: Power and Battery Technology: Today’s humanoid robots are limited by power storage and efficiency. Most prototypes can only operate for short durations (often 1–2 hours) before needing recharge , especially those using power-hungry hydraulic actuators. Achieving a full day’s work on a single charge will require major improvements in battery energy density or alternative power sources . Engineers are exploring solutions like fast charging cycles, more efficient motors,39 43 44 45 46 45 45 45 47 43 48 49 • 50 6 and possibly tethered power for some applications. Until energy capacity improves drastically, robots will struggle with endurance, particularly in mobile untethered roles. Actuation and Materials: Replicating the strength, precision, and robustness of human muscles with electromechanical actuators is challenging. There are trade-offs between power and weight – stronger actuators tend to be heavier or bulkier , which can impede a robot’s agility. Advancements in lightweight materials (e.g. carbon fiber, titanium alloys) and novel actuators (like artificial muscles) will be needed to give humanoids human-level strength and nimbleness without making them too heavy or energy-intensive. Perception and Cognition: Operating in unstructured environments (like homes or busy public spaces) demands extremely advanced perception and decision-making . Robots must interpret visual and auditory inputs, understand context, and navigate around unpredictable obstacles (pets, children, clutter , etc.). While AI has come far , current robots can still be confused by novel situations . Achieving true human-level adaptability will require further breakthroughs in machine perception (better vision systems, depth sensors, tactile sensing) and cognitive AI that can handle open-ended reasoning in real time . Endowing a robot with common sense knowledge – for example, knowing that spilling juice on the floor makes it slippery, or that a crying sound might indicate someone is hurt – is an ongoing research challenge. Dexterous Manipulation: Human hands are incredibly versatile – from opening a jar to threading a needle – thanks to our fine motor control and sense of touch. Robotic hands are improving (e.g. some now have tactile sensors and 20+ degrees of freedom in fingers ), but truly human- like manipulation remains an unsolved problem. Tasks that require subtle finger control, adjusting force dynamically, or handling irregular objects (like folding clothes) are still very difficult for robots. Progress in this area is crucial for many service and home applications. Reliability and Safety: For robots to be deployed widely, they must be extremely reliable and fail- safe. A glitch causing a robot to stumble or drop a heavy object could be dangerous. Robust error handling, redundancy, and safety systems are needed to ensure robots can work among people without incidents. This is both an engineering and a regulatory hurdle – standards and certifications (similar to how airplanes or cars are certified) will likely be developed for humanoid robots before they are allowed in public use at scale. Social and Ethical Factors: (Though the user asked for strictly technical focus, it’s worth noting briefly.) Humanoid robots interacting with humans need to have appropriate behavior – they must be intuitive to communicate with and not evoke fear or discomfort. Designing robots that people trust (for example, to care for the elderly or children) involves challenges in human-robot interaction , which blurs the line between technical and social. While not a physical “limit,” public acceptance will influence the ultimate integration of humanoids into daily life. Most experts believe these challenges will be solved over time, but the timeline is uncertain. In particular , achieving a reliable home assistant robot is likely the hardest step and may take until the 2040s or 2050s when AI, hardware, and safety have all sufficiently advanced . In the near term (next 5–10 years), we can expect robots to excel in structured settings (factories, warehouses) where their limitations are less problematic. As technological bottlenecks (like battery life and manipulation skill) are incrementally overcome, a tipping point could occur . Industry analysts refer to an “ electric vehicle moment ” for• • 51 • 2829 • • 4547 7 humanoids sometime after 2030 – analogous to how EVs suddenly surged once range and cost hit acceptable thresholds . In summary, the upper limits on today’s humanoid robots are primarily technical constraints in power , dexterity, perception, and safety. Over the next two decades, sustained R&D is expected to push those limits back, enabling robots to progressively match human abilities in more areas. But until then, the pace of deployment in certain domains (especially the home) will be gated by these challenges. Outlook for 2050 and Beyond Looking ahead to the 2050s , it’s envisioned that humanoid robots will be an everyday presence globally , much as personal computers or smartphones are today. If current development and adoption trends hold, the world by 2050 could feature hundreds of millions of humanoid robots operating in various capacities . Factories and logistics centers might be almost fully automated with human-like robots handling material transport, assembly, and maintenance. In hospitals and eldercare facilities, robots could assist nurses by lifting patients or delivering medications. In public infrastructure, one might see robots cleaning streets, repairing utility lines, or responding to fires and disasters (performing dangerous rescues that would be risky for human firefighters). And in domestic settings, early adopter households – particularly in wealthy or aging societies – may have a humanoid helper that can tidy up, do laundry, prepare simple meals, or provide mobility assistance to the elderly. This vision of the 2050s is essentially the realization of science-fiction’s promise: intelligent machines working hand-in-hand with humans to enhance productivity and quality of life. It’s important to note that the advanced AI and robotics paths converge here. The brains of these future robots will be the advanced AI systems discussed in the first half of this report. By 2050, if AI has reached something approaching human-level cognition, each humanoid robot could be equipped with an “AI mind” that makes it a truly general worker . This implies a robot could be assigned a new job or task (say, “please organize this entire warehouse” or “help teach this math class” ) and it would be able to understand, learn, and perform it almost as a person would. The combination of AI brains with robotic bodies would be profoundly transformative. Economically, it could dramatically expand output: robots do not tire, and can work 24/7 with only occasional maintenance . Societally, it raises important questions about how humans will work alongside these machines and how work and life might be redefined when “labor” is abundant. Those questions aside, the technical trajectory suggests that by mid-century we approach a point where anything that a human can do physically or mentally, a machine (AI+robot) can do as well . In summary, the period from 2025 to 2050 is expected to take us from the dawn of practical humanoid robots to a world where they are commonplace. By the 2040s , forecasts point to AGI-level AI being a reality (with at least a 50% chance as estimated by experts) , and concurrently, tens of millions of robots populating the workforce and society . The future of advanced AI and robotics is deeply interconnected – powerful cognitive AI will drive more capable robots, and widespread robots will, in turn, amplify the impact of AI on the physical world. While there are uncertainties in timing and many hurdles yet to overcome, virtually all indicators show that AI and humanoid robots will play central, transformative roles in the mid-21st century . The improvements in just the next 5–10 years will be telling: if current rapid progress continues, by 2030 we’ll have a clear glimpse of a future where intelligent humanoid machines are as integral to daily life as computers or automobiles are today. The decades from 2030 to 2050 could then fulfill that vision, ushering in a new era where humanity and our creations work side by side to propel innovation and prosperity to new heights. 52 43 48 4 43 8 Compute Trends Across Three Eras of Machine Learning | Epoch AI https://epoch.ai/blog/compute-trends Will We Run Out of Data to Train Large Language Models? | Epoch AI https://epoch.ai/blog/will-we-run-out-of-data-limits-of-llm-scaling-based-on-human-generated-data When Will AGI/Singularity Happen? 8,590 Predictions Analyzed https://research.aimultiple.com/artificial-general-intelligence-singularity-timing/ Current AI scaling laws are showing diminishing returns, forcing AI labs to change course | TechCrunch https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/ai-scaling-laws-are-showing-diminishing-returns-forcing-ai-labs-to-change-course/ 50 NEW Artificial Intelligence Statistics (July 2025) https://explodingtopics.com/blog/ai-statistics AI Statistics 2024–2025: Global Trends, Market Growth & Adoption ... https://ff.co/ai-statistics-trends-global-market/ Artificial Intelligence Statistics https://www.magnetaba.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-statistics Watch Elon Musk's Optimus Gen 2 robot in action | Live Science https://www.livescience.com/technology/robotics/elon-musk-teased-telsas-optimus-gen-2-robot-featuring-a-funky-treat Humanoid Robots at Work: What Executives Need to Know | Bain & Company https://www.bain.com/insights/humanoid-robots-at-work-what-executives-need-to-know/ World to host 3 billion humanoid robots by 2060, Bank of America estimates : r/Futurology https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1j7yu7s/world_to_host_3_billion_humanoid_robots_by_2060/ The Rise of Humanoids, Explained https://www.globalxetfs.com/articles/the-rise-of-humanoids-explained World to Have 300 Million Humanoid Robots by 2050, UBS Report Says https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/300-million-humanoid-robots-to-roam-the-globe-by-2050-ubs-report-says1 3 2 9 4 510 24 25 26 6 7 827 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 28 29 30 31 32 33 35 36 37 39 48 49 34 40 41 42 38 44 45 46 47 50 51 43 52 9
