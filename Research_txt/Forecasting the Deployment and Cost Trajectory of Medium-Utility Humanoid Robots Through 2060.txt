Forecasting the Deployment and Cost Trajectory of Medium-Utility Humanoid Robots Through 2060 Executive Summary Humanoid robots are poised to become a transformative general-purpose technology over the next several decades. This whitepaper provides a data-driven forecast of global cumulative deployments and unit costs of medium-utility humanoid robots through 2060, underpinned by rigorous assumptions about learning curves, market adoption, and technological innovation. Key findings include: Explosive Growth in Deployments: The total installed base of humanoid robots worldwide could grow from virtually zero today to billions of units by 2060 , driven by accelerating adoption in the 2030s and 2040s. Our mid-range forecast projects roughly 3 billion robots in service by 2060 , with a plausible range from ~1 billion (conservative scenario) to ~15+ billion (optimistic scenario) depending on technological progress and market dynamics. Rapid Decline in Unit Costs: The typical unit cost (in constant 2025 USD) of a humanoid robot is expected to plummet by over an order of magnitude over the next 30 years. Early commercial units in the mid-2020s cost on the order of \$20k–\$30k . By 2040, large-scale manufacturing and learning-curve effects could reduce unit prices to the mid–thousands of dollars, potentially around \ $5k or lower . By 2060, baseline models may cost only a few thousand dollars or less, with optimistic trajectories seeing costs below \$1,000 per unit. This cost decline will make robot labor dramatically cheaper than human labor , ushering in near-zero marginal cost of routine work . Assumptions and Drivers: Our projections assume continued learning-curve cost improvements (Wright’s Law) as volumes double, a realistic timeline for product/market fit (with initial high prices and limited capabilities in the 2020s, widespread viability by late 2030s ), and steady advances in components (batteries, motors, chips, sensors) enabled by heavy R&D investment. We account for manufacturing ramp-up constraints (factory build-out, supply chain scaling) and adoption dynamics (labor shortages, induced demand once robots undercut human wages ). Speculative but plausible innovations – from artificial muscle actuators to AI-driven control (LLMs) to solid- state batteries – are factored in as upside catalysts for capability and cost. Strategic Implications: The impending boom in humanoid robotics carries profound implications for industries, investors, and policymakers. Trillion-dollar markets are expected to form around robot manufacturing, maintenance, and services . Human–robot labor cost crossover will force a rethinking of workforce development and social safety nets. Nations at the forefront of robot adoption and production could reap outsized economic gains, whereas laggards risk dependency on foreign robotic labor and technology . Proactive strategies – incentivizing domestic robot production, re-skilling programs, and ethical/regulatory frameworks – will be critical to maximize the benefits of this revolution while managing disruption.• 1 23 4 • 5 6 7 • 8 9 • 1011 12 1 This whitepaper is organized into two analytical sections (deployment forecast and cost trajectory), followed by a deep dive into modeling assumptions, and concluding with strategic recommendations. All forecasts are presented with uncertainty intervals to emphasize the range of possible outcomes. Inline citations to academic, industry, and financial sources are provided throughout, supporting the data and claims made. Cumulative Deployment Forecast (2025–2060) Humanoid robots are expected to follow an S-curve adoption pattern characteristic of major general- purpose technologies, albeit on a potentially unprecedented scale. Figure 1 below shows the projected global installed base of medium-utility humanoid robots from 2025 through 2060, along with a confidence band representing high and low adoption scenarios. Figure 1: Global Cumulative Deployment of Medium-Utility Humanoid Robots, 2025–2060. The solid blue line shows the mid-range forecast (≈3 billion units by 2060), while the shaded region indicates a plausible range from a conservative scenario (~1 billion units by 2060) to an optimistic scenario (>10 billion). Early deployment is slow in the 2020s, followed by exponential growth in the 2035–2050 period as costs fall and capabilities improve, eventually reaching saturation-like levels by 2060. Baseline Trajectory: In our mid-case forecast, the number of humanoid robots in operation worldwide rises from essentially zero in 2025 to around 1 million units/year by 2030 (annual sales) , totaling on the order of a few million cumulative units deployed by that date. Adoption remains in its infancy through the late 2020s due to high costs and limited capabilities of first-generation models. By the mid-2030s , however , technical improvements and early use-case validation drive accelerating growth – for example, Morgan Stanley projects ~ 13 million robots in use by 2035 in industrial and commercial settings . In our model, cumulative deployments cross the 10<sup>7</sup> (ten million) mark in the 2030s and then enter a phase of hyper-growth . During the 2040s , humanoid robotics could reach mass-adoption inflection. Our baseline shows the installed base surging into the hundreds of millions of units by ~2040 and continuing to climb steeply 1 13 2 through that decade. This aligns with qualitative forecasts that “adoption will be relatively slow until the mid-2030s, accelerating in the late 2030s and 2040s” . By 2050 , we forecast roughly 1.5 billion robots in service globally (mid-case). For context, Morgan Stanley’s analysts similarly envision “more than 1 billion humanoids in use by 2050, with 90% used for industrial and commercial purposes” . Growth moderates somewhat post-2050 as certain markets approach saturation and the most easily automatable tasks are largely converted to robot labor . Even so, by 2060 , our central estimate reaches approximately 3 billion humanoid robots worldwide , equivalent to roughly 0.3 robots per person (assuming a 10 billion human population). Notably, Bank of America analysts likewise project about 3 billion humanoid robots in service by 2060 , with a majority deployed in homes and service sectors by that time . Uncertainty – High and Low Scenarios: The shaded confidence band in Figure 1 illustrates the considerable uncertainty in long-range forecasts. In a conservative scenario , technological and market barriers may constrain adoption to the low end of projections. Perhaps humanoid robots prove more expensive or less capable than anticipated until later in the 2040s, or regulatory/social resistance slows deployment. In such a case, global installations might only reach on the order of 1–2 billion units by 2060 (lower bound in Figure 1). This aligns with Morgan Stanley’s base-case of ~1 billion by 2050 , extended modestly to ~2 billion by 2060 as growth continues at a tempered pace. Conversely, an optimistic scenario could see an outright robotics boom unfolding more rapidly and pervasively than the base case. If technical breakthroughs and aggressive scaling occur in the 2020s, humanoid robots might achieve broad product-market fit earlier (e.g. by 2030) , unleashing exponential adoption in the 2030s. Elon Musk has gone so far as to predict “at least 10 billion humanoid robots by 2040” – a figure that would outnumber the human population. While that upper extreme would require extraordinarily fast manufacturing scale-up (on the order of hundreds of millions of units produced annually by the late 2030s ), it underscores the potential speed of adoption if cost and capability hurdles are overcome. Our high scenario, influenced by such optimism, reaches on the order of 10–15+ billion robots by 2060 , reflecting a world where robots are nearly ubiquitous – found not just in every factory and warehouse, but in the majority of homes, offices, hospitals, and public spaces. This scenario echoes analyses like RethinkX, which foresee robot labor supply expanding by “one or two orders of magnitude” in the 2040s as cost approaches zero . Drivers of Adoption: Several factors underpin the expected S-curve in deployments: Economics & Tipping Points: By the late 2030s, the total cost of ownership of a humanoid robot is likely to undercut human labor costs in many jobs, creating an economic tipping point for adoption . One estimate finds that a \$20,000 robot working 24/7 (with minimal downtime) equates to a labor cost of only \$1–\$2 per hour . For comparison, human workers cost \$15–\$40+ per hour in many developed markets. As soon as robots can perform tasks even a fraction as well as humans, such a huge cost advantage virtually compels firms to invest in automation to stay competitive . By 2040, if robot labor can be as cheap as \$0.10–\$1 per hour , adoption will likely accelerate explosively across industries. Labor Shortages and Demand: Demographic trends (aging populations, shrinking manufacturing workforces) and chronic labor shortages in sectors like logistics, elder care, and construction are creating strong demand-pull for humanoid robots . Forecasts indicate an 8 million worker gap in global manufacturing by 2030 , which robots could help fill. Governments are also pushing industrial reshoring, and with fewer young workers entering these trades, automation becomes the14 23 1 115 2 4 16 1718 • 9 9 9 19 • 2021 22 3 linchpin for maintaining productivity . This dynamic suggests a receptive market once affordable robots are available. Initial Markets and Expansion: Early deployments in the 2025–2035 period will likely focus on structured environments and repetitive tasks – e.g. robots working in warehouses, machine tending in factories, and simple service roles. Indeed, >90% of the first million humanoids are expected to be in industrial/commercial use . As their capabilities improve (e.g. dexterity, safety, autonomy), robots will branch into more environments. By the 2040s, the mix shifts increasingly to household and service-sector robots . Bank of America projects that by 2060, about 65% of humanoid robots will be in domestic use (as household helpers, personal care aides, etc.), 32% in service industries, and only ~3% in traditional manufacturing . This reflects how the addressable market expands dramatically once robots can operate in unstructured human-centric settings (homes, retail, outdoors), multiplying the demand manyfold. Global Competition: Another accelerant is the geopolitical race in robotics. China is investing heavily to lead in mass-producing humanoids – Chinese firms like Unitree and Fourier are already deploying affordable humanoid units (~\$15,000 each) . Strong government support in China (subsidies, tech development programs) is fast-tracking their robotics industry . This in turn pressures other nations (U.S., EU, Japan, etc.) to not fall behind. A coordinated push by governments and industry – akin to a new “space race” for intelligent labor – could compress the adoption timeline. For instance, if the U.S. were to launch a Manhattan Project–style program for humanoid robotics (as some experts call for ), it might catalyze breakthroughs and deployment on an expedited schedule. Conversely, a lack of urgency or collaboration could slow adoption in certain regions. Our mid forecast assumes a moderate level of competitive drive, whereas the high scenario reflects a world where the race for robot supremacy significantly accelerates deployment. In summary, while exact numbers are uncertain, the direction of travel is clear : barring an unforeseen plateau in technology, humanoid robots are on track to become a ubiquitous feature of the global economy by mid-century. Whether the world ends up with “only” a billion robots or tens of billions, the societal impact will be enormous. The next section examines the cost side of the equation, explaining why costs are expected to fall so dramatically – a key enabler of the adoption curve described here. Cost Trajectory Forecast (Unit Cost in 2025 USD) A fundamental driver of the adoption boom is the declining cost of manufacturing and operating humanoid robots. As production scales up and technology improves, unit costs are projected to follow a steep learning curve decline , analogous to past cost trajectories in semiconductors, solar panels, and batteries. Figure 2 presents our forecast for the average unit cost of a medium-utility humanoid robot (expressed in inflation-adjusted 2025 dollars) from now until 2060, with a central projection and uncertainty band.2324 • 23 25 • 1226 27 28 4 Figure 2: Unit Cost Trajectory for Humanoid Robots (2025 USD, log scale). The solid red line is the mid-case forecast, indicating that unit prices fall from tens of thousands of dollars in the 2020s to only a few thousand by 2050–2060. The shaded band shows a range from a slower-improvement scenario (upper bound, e.g. ~$5k per robot in 2060) to a faster-learning scenario (lower bound, e.g. <$1k by 2060). The y-axis is on a logarithmic scale, illustrating the roughly order-of-magnitude cost reductions per ~15–20 years. Several distinct phases can be observed: Current and Near-Term Costs (2025–2030): Today’s humanoid robots are expensive prototypes . High-end models like Boston Dynamics’ Atlas are essentially R&D projects costing hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars each (not sold commercially). However , early commercial units aimed at real applications are targeting far lower price points. Tesla has indicated its initial Optimus robot (low-volume production starting ~2025) is aimed at a cost of $20,000–$30,000 per unit . Similarly, China’s Unitree Robotics plans to mass-produce its 23-DOF G1 humanoid at around $16,000 per unit . These figures (~$15k–$30k) likely involve selling at or near cost in early years to encourage adoption. According to a Bank of America study, the average production cost in 2025 is around $35,000 per unit , but is projected to drop to ~$17,000 by 2030 as initial scale is reached . Our mid forecast aligns with that ~50% cost reduction over five years, which is aggressive but plausible given the rapid iteration and learning in the 2025–2030 period. In other words, by 2030 a typical humanoid robot might cost on the order of only $15k (with cheaper models available in the $10k range). Already between 2022 and 2024, the unit cost dropped by at least 40% in real terms , indicating that cost parity with human labor is quickly coming into view . For example, a $16,000 robot (Unitree’s price) roughly matches the fully-burdened annual cost of a minimum-wage worker in the US – a milestone suggesting robots will soon be economically competitive in low-skill jobs. Mid-Term Cost Decline (2030s): We expect Wright’s Law (learning-by-doing) to drive sustained cost declines as cumulative production doubles repeatedly during the 2030s. Many of the underlying components – batteries, processors, sensors – will themselves get cheaper due to improvements and volume production (often leveraging scale from adjacent industries like electric vehicles and • 5 29 6 30 30 • 5 consumer electronics). Wright’s Law states that every doubling of cumulative units typically yields a fixed percentage cost reduction . In manufacturing domains, learning rates of 10–20% cost reduction per doubling are common . Humanoid robots could plausibly be on the higher end of that range initially, as there is substantial “low-hanging fruit” to optimize (e.g. simplifying designs, automating assembly, reducing expensive components). Our mid scenario assumes ~15% cost reduction per cumulative doubling. Starting from say ~10,000 units in 2025 to millions by late 2030s entails well over 8–10 doublings, which mathematically suggests a roughly 5-10x cost reduction in that timeframe. Concretely, if a robot costs ~$20k in 2025, a 5–10× drop would put it in the $2k–$4k range by around 2040 in real terms. This corresponds with forecasts by RethinkX that the effective cost of robot labor (in $/hour) will improve by an order of magnitude every ~8 years in the early stages . By the end of the 2030s, even if hardware still costs a few thousand dollars, the amortized cost per hour of work could be mere cents , due to robots’ high utilization (up to ~20 hours/day of productive time ). Indeed, analysts predict that by 2035 a humanoid robot’s labor might cost on the order of $1/hour , dramatically undercutting human wages. Long-Term and Saturating Costs (2040–2060): As production scales into the millions per year (2040s) and eventually tens or hundreds of millions per year (2050s), cost declines will continue, though likely at a gradually slowing rate as certain material costs and physical limits are reached. By 2040, our mid estimate for unit cost is roughly $3,000–$5,000 . Elon Musk has suggested that complexity aside, ultimately a humanoid should “end up costing less than half of a car” – implying a target under ~$15,000, which our 2030s projections already beat. Morgan Stanley’s scenario of 1 billion robots for a $5 trillion market by 2050 equates to an average revenue of ~$5,000 per robot , consistent with unit selling prices in the mid-thousands plus after-market services. By 2050 , we anticipate baseline models could be ~$2,000 or lower to purchase (2025 dollars). In the best-case high-learning scenario, unit prices around $500–$1,000 might be achievable by 2050–2060, which is akin to the cost of a home appliance. At that point, robots would be widely affordable even for households in emerging markets, further boosting adoption. In a slower-improvement scenario (low band), perhaps costs only drop to ~\$5k by 2060 – still a >5× reduction vs today. Even that case yields huge economic benefits, but the transformational potential is greater if costs approach the lower bound. By 2060 , we forecast a mid-case unit cost of roughly $1,500–$3,000 (constant dollars). It’s worth noting that these are average prices; premium models with advanced capabilities might still cost more, while mass-produced basic units for simple tasks could cost well under $1k. The overarching trend is that robot hardware becomes commoditized and ultra-cheap relative to human labor value, enabling deployment at scales previously unimaginable. The confidence interval in Figure 2 encapsulates uncertainties in technological progress and learning rates. For example, if fundamental cost bottlenecks (materials like rare-earth metals for motors, semiconductor supply, etc.) are hit, the curve might flatten toward the upper bound. Conversely, if disruptive innovations arrive (see Section on Innovations), the curve could dip toward the lower bound, approaching asymptotically low costs by late century. Learning Curve Assumptions: The cost trajectory is deeply rooted in Wright’s Law. Historical data for analogous technologies (like industrial robots and batteries) provide a guide. Lithium-ion batteries, for instance, exhibited ~18% learning rate for decades . Our assumed ~15% rate for robots is cautious given the complexity of humanoids, but we acknowledge the possibility of faster improvements given the confluence of multiple advancing technologies (AI, sensors, etc.). A Bank of America analysis explicitly cites a drop from $35k in 2025 to $17k in 2030 , which in unit cost terms reflects roughly a 10% learning rate if3132 33 34 19 35 19 • 36 13 37 6 6 cumulative output grows as expected. However , as production ramps more steeply in the 2030s, we expect learning to continue apace. ARK Invest notes that Wright’s Law-based forecasts tend to be more accurate than time-based heuristics for emerging tech , so we have grounded our cost model in cumulative production rather than arbitrary time assumptions. Importantly, operating costs (OpEx) for robots are projected to be minimal and declining. Electric energy to run a humanoid robot costs only pennies per hour . Maintenance is the main ongoing expense, but as reliability improves and modular designs allow quick swaps of parts, maintenance costs too will drop or be spread over many hours of operation. RethinkX argues that marginal operating cost will approach near-zero , meaning once you own a robot, each additional task it performs has almost no cost . This is analogous to computers: the capital cost is significant, but running the CPU for another second costs effectively nothing. Thus, from a total cost of service perspective, it is primarily the upfront purchase price that matters – and that is falling rapidly. Cost vs. Human Labor: To highlight the economic significance: at \$20k purchase price, assuming a robot can work ~4,000 hours/year (two shifts with downtime) for 5 years (~20,000 hours lifetime ), the cost per hour is \$1 (not including electricity) – far below even minimum wage. Some analyses present an even more optimistic framing: “lease a \$30k robot for \$300/month, that’s ~$10 a day, or \$0.40 an hour” . By 2035, if robots cost ~$10k or less, the hourly cost falls under \$0.50 in many cases. Even adding power and maintenance, we are looking at sub-\$1/hr labor . By 2040, in high-adoption scenarios, robot labor could be literally pennies per hour . This is an almost unthinkable drop in the cost of labor – a disruptive economic force. For comparison, the industrial revolution reduced the cost of mechanical work (via steam engines) dramatically, but human cognitive and manual labor costs have never experienced such a deflationary shock. This is why some economists predict a potential doubling of GDP growth rates in countries that embrace robotic labor , as cheap robot workforce drives productivity up exponentially. In summary, our cost forecast paints a future where humanoids become increasingly affordable capital goods – perhaps cheaper than the appliances they operate or the furniture they move. The convergence of improvements in manufacturing efficiency, component price declines, and design optimization ensures that each new generation of robots will cost less and do more. The next section details the assumptions behind these forecasts, including the key technological and market factors at play. Modeling Assumptions and Key Factors Our forecasts are built upon a set of explicit assumptions and parameters, reflecting both empirical data and reasoned expectations about future developments. In this section, we elaborate on the major modeling inputs and the rationale behind them: Learning Curve Effects (Wright’s Law) Wright’s Law posits that each doubling of cumulative production yields a fixed percentage reduction in cost . We assume that humanoid robot manufacturing will exhibit strong learning effects through 2060, especially in the early stages when design and process improvements are rapid. Key points include: Initial Learning Rate: We assume ~15% cost reduction per doubling in the 2020s–2030s. This is informed by analogous industries – e.g., industrial automation components and lithium batteries – and early data. The Bank of America projection of a ~50% cost drop from 2025 to 2030 , during38 39 7 40 41 19 42 3132 • 6 7 which cumulative units might double 3–4 times, corresponds to roughly a 15% learning rate, which supports our assumption. Declining Gains Over Time: As production scales to tens of millions of units, not every doubling will yield the same % drop; learning can taper as processes mature. We bake in a slight decline in incremental improvements post-2040 (effectively, our model transitions from ~15% learning to ~10% learning in later decades). This acknowledges that some fixed costs (materials, physics limits) eventually dominate. Cost Components: A humanoid robot’s cost structure includes: actuators/motors (~30-40%), sensors and electronics (~20%), batteries (~10%), structural/frame materials (~10%), and assembly/overhead (~20%, initially high but falling as automation in manufacturing increases) . Each of these components has its own learning curve. For example, electric motor costs could fall significantly with volume, but they rely on magnets and copper which have commodity constraints. Battery costs are shared with EVs, which are already on a learning curve. We assume synergy where possible – e.g., if EV battery $/kWh falls, robot battery packs (often a few kWh in size) become cheaper . Design & Process Improvements: Wright’s Law is not just about volume; it’s about learning by doing . We anticipate major redesigns of humanoid robots as engineers learn from initial deployments. Early units might be over-engineered or utilize expensive off-the-shelf components (e.g. high-cost aerospace-grade sensors). Over time, robotics firms will design custom components optimized for cost (for instance, replacing a \$5000 LiDAR with a \$50 camera array + AI software). Tesla’s philosophy with Optimus, for example, is to leverage mass-produced car components where possible (like FSD computer chips, camera modules) to keep costs low . Such integration and reuse is a form of learning and scale economy. We assume that by ~2030, many high-cost components see cheaper next-generation substitutes. In summary, our modeling treats Wright’s Law as a reliable guide: cumulative volume is the main driver of cost decline . If adoption were to lag (fewer robots made), costs would stay higher (this coupling of adoption and cost is why our scenarios diverge). Conversely, a virtuous cycle could emerge: more robots lowers cost, which drives more demand, further lowering cost – a positive feedback loop akin to what happened with solar power in the 2010s . Product-Market and Price-Market Fit Timeline The timing of when humanoid robots become truly viable and ubiquitous is a critical uncertainty. Our forecast assumes the following timeline for product/market fit: 2020s – Experimental Phase: Humanoids remain niche and exploratory . Use cases are tested in pilot programs (e.g., robots in a few warehouses, labs, or as greeters). They are not yet mission-critical in most operations. The price point (>$20k) and unproven reliability limit their deployment to early adopters and R&D budgets. Early 2030s – Early Commercialization: By around 2030, we assume at least one or two models of humanoid robot have reached commercial viability for specific applications such as warehouse logistics or simple manufacturing tasks. This is supported by projections of ~1 million annual sales by 2030 – implying some degree of market acceptance. However , this period may see high prices• • 43 • 544 45 • • 1 8 and limited capabilities : robots might still cost ~$15k+ so adoption is mostly in high-wage environments where ROI can be demonstrated (e.g., a robot that replaces a \$30k/year warehouse worker might justify a \$100k five-year cost, but not much beyond that). Thus early 2030s growth, while “steady”, is not explosive . Mid/Late 2030s – Inflection Point: We assume the “iPhone moment” for humanoid robots occurs in the 2035–2040 window. Several converging factors (cost falling under ~$10k, robots achieving near-human dexterity and safety, and user-friendly training interfaces) likely coincide to unlock mass-market demand . Bain & Company notes that “within five years, robots will perform a wide range of physical tasks at a cost that rivals human labor… adoption is poised to accelerate across industries” . This suggests an inflection by ~2030s end. Our model reflects this by transitioning from moderate growth to high growth in the late 2030s . Essentially, the product-market fit (robots that can do valuable work reliably) and price-market fit (robots cheap enough to save cost in many jobs) both solidify around that time, leading to rapid diffusion. 2040s – Broad Adoption: Once robots are demonstrably cost-effective and have proven themselves in early adopting industries, adoption spreads broadly, including into more conservative sectors. By the 2040s we assume humanoid robots become a commonplace investment for companies and even start entering consumer markets (household robots). The Morgan Stanley forecast explicitly states “adoption…likely to accelerate in the late 2030s and 2040s” which we mirror . We also factor in improvements in AI and generality during this time – second-generation robots in the 2040s will be far more capable (e.g. able to learn new tasks via AI simply by demonstration or voice command, rather than custom programming ). This greatly expands where they can be used. 2050s – Maturity and Saturation: By the 2050s, we anticipate that in developed economies, most large firms and many households that can benefit from a robot will already have adopted at least one. Growth shifts more to replacements and upgrades, as well as penetration of remaining markets (like poorer regions catching up). Our model shows a tapering growth rate by 2050s accordingly (an S-curve flattening). This doesn’t mean no growth – the installed base could still double or triple during 2050–2060, but compared to the explosive 2040s it is slower . We also assume by this stage that robots are integrated enough that further adoption may be constrained by factors outside price – such as regulations, cultural preferences, or saturation of applications that truly need humanoid form (some tasks may stick with specialized non-humanoid machines, for example). This timeline is inherently speculative, but we calibrate it with historical analogies (e.g., industrial robots took ~20 years from introduction to broad use; personal computers similarly had a multi-decade adoption wave). The rapid improvement in AI suggests humanoid robots might diffuse faster than those past technologies once they hit the market sweet spot. Component Costs and Material Availability Humanoid robots are complex systems comprising many components. Our forecasts assume generally that component costs will decline and that material bottlenecks are addressable , but we do monitor a few critical areas: Batteries: Robots rely on high-energy-density batteries (often lithium-ion today) to operate untethered. The good news is battery technology is advancing quickly due to EV demand. By 2030,46 • 4748 49 • 14 5051 • • 9 lithium-ion battery costs are projected to halve again compared to 2020, and emerging solid-state batteries or other chemistries could further improve energy per weight . We assume robots benefit from these advances, enabling lighter , cheaper battery packs with higher capacity (meaning longer operation per charge and/or smaller batteries needed). One robot might require a battery of only a few kWh (like an electric scooter), so even a world with billions of robots is not as large a battery demand as billions of EVs. Thus, we do not see lithium supply as a showstopper , though short-term tightness is possible. By the 2040s, alternatives (solid-state, sodium-ion for lower cost, etc.) likely mitigate battery supply issues. Electric Motors & Actuators: Actuators (the “muscles” of the robot) are a major cost and depend on precision mechanical parts. High-torque dense motors often require rare-earth magnets (Neodymium-Iron-Boron), which today are mostly produced in China. A surge in robot production will increase demand for these magnets significantly (each humanoid might use several kilograms of NdFeB magnets across all joints). This could be a supply risk. We assume that rising demand spurs new investments in magnet production and mining outside of current sources, as well as materials innovation (e.g., magnet-free motor designs or recycled magnet supply). Companies like Nidec (Japan), a leading motor manufacturer , are already scaling up to supply robotics and EV markets . Gearbox makers like Harmonic Drive and Nabtesco are increasing output as well . Our model presumes these supply chains keep pace by the 2030s. If not, costs would stay higher (one reason our low scenario cost is higher is potential supply constraints keeping motor/actuator prices elevated into the 2030s). Semiconductors and Compute: Each humanoid will contain a suite of computers (CPUs, GPUs or neural chips for AI, etc.). Fortunately, unlike some hardware, compute tends to improve (more cost-effective) over time – following Moore’s Law and now specialized AI accelerator trends. We anticipate no fundamental issues with providing enough computing power; chip costs per performance are dropping and even if Moore’s Law slows, volume production of current chips will get cheaper . By 2060, a robot’s entire “brain” could be on a single inexpensive chip given the likely advances in integration. So, compute cost is not a major contributor to long-term cost floor (we consider it negligible by 2060, like how microcontrollers are pennies today). Sensors: Cameras, microphones, and basic proximity sensors are already extremely cheap at scale (commodity smartphone components). More exotic sensors like LiDAR or radar are currently pricey, but may not be strictly necessary if vision AI is advanced enough (e.g., Tesla’s approach avoids LiDAR). We expect sensor costs to be a shrinking fraction of BOM cost. By 2060, sensors are ubiquitous and low-cost; even high-performance 3D cameras or depth sensors could cost only a few dollars. Thus, sensor costs likely do not impede the cost trajectory. Materials and Supply Risks: Key raw materials include high-grade aluminum or composites for frames, copper for motors, silicon for chips, rare earths for magnets, lithium/cobalt for batteries, etc. For each, our assumption is that scale breeds innovation : if any material becomes too expensive, substitutes or recycling or new sources will emerge. For example, recycling of batteries and motors could supply a significant portion of materials by 2060. We also anticipate geopolitical diversification – countries will invest to ensure access to strategic materials (already happening for lithium, rare earths, etc.). In the worst case, if material shortages occur , it might slow cost declines (hitting a floor due to commodity prices), but given the long horizon, we expect technological solutions to mitigate these. Solid-state batteries might use less or no cobalt; new motor designs52 • 43 43 • • • 10 might use less rare earth; or entirely new actuator mechanisms (see Innovations) could reduce dependence on current scarce materials. Overall, we assume no insurmountable materials bottleneck . There is sufficient iron, aluminum, etc. for billions of robots; and for scarcer elements, high demand will incentivize increased supply or alternatives. Our cost projections do implicitly flatten out in the lowest scenarios partly because we assume eventually you hit raw material costs that can’t drop much more. For instance, even if manufacturing is perfected, a robot might still have \$500 of raw metals and magnets in it – that sets a practical lower bound unless new materials change the game. Capital Expenditure and Manufacturing Scale-Up A critical real-world constraint is the ability to manufacture robots in the quantities forecast . Building millions (eventually billions) of complex electromechanical systems requires substantial capital investment in factories, automation, and supply networks. We account for these factors qualitatively: Factory Construction Timeline: Ramping from essentially zero production in 2025 to millions per year is a huge challenge. If we use electric vehicles as an analogy, it took Tesla roughly 10 years to go from producing <100k cars/year to 1 million+/year , with many new factories along the way. Humanoid robot production might ramp faster because robots are smaller and potentially simpler to assemble than cars, but it will still require dozens of large factories globally. Our adoption timeline (mass uptake by late 2030s) assumes that significant factory build-out occurs during the 2020s and early 2030s . Many companies (Tesla, Figure AI, Agility, Xiaomi, etc.) are likely to invest in pilot production lines by 2025–2027. By the early 2030s, we expect the first gigafactory-scale robot plants to come online, each capable of perhaps 100k+ units annually. Tesla’s Optimus program, for example, has hinted at targeting high-volume production in the second half of the decade . Our model presumes that by 2035, global production capacity in place is on the order of millions per year (though actual demand might not yet fully utilize it until late ’30s). Capital Investment Requirements: We acknowledge that scaling to billions of units will require trillions of dollars in cumulative investment over decades (factories, tooling, R&D). The auto industry provides a reference – tens of millions of vehicles are produced yearly via a massive global capital stock of plants. The humanoid robot industry would need to reach similar scale. We assume that the enormous economic promise (multi-trillion market sizes ) will attract the needed capital. The 2020s have already seen a boom in robotics funding (venture capital, corporate investment). As robots prove their market, more capital (including government subsidies possibly) will flow. We also anticipate that automation in manufacturing robots will improve over time – meta, robots building robots. Elon Musk has noted that Optimus robots might eventually be used on the assembly line to build more robots, eliminating some human labor and increasing scalable throughput. By 2060, robot factories could be highly autonomous, lowering the marginal cost and scaling friction. Production Learning and Yield: Early manufacturing might be slow and yields low (high scrap/ rework rates) because building humanoids is non-trivial. Our cost projections implicitly factor in manufacturing learning that improves yield and throughput. By the time of mass production, these processes should be ironed out. If not, costs would be higher . We assume by ~2030s mass production is refined much like auto manufacturing was refined in the early 20th century.• 544 • 1011 • 11 Supply Chain Coordination: Building a robot involves a large supply chain (motors from one vendor , chips from another , etc.). Scaling up smoothly means each part of the chain must expand in tandem. There is risk of mismatches (e.g., motor shortage delaying production). Our adoption curve’s slow start through 2030 helps here – it gives time for suppliers to ramp. From 2035 onward, we assume close coordination and possibly vertical integration (Tesla, for instance, may produce many sub- components in-house, as hinted by their vertical approach ). Governments may also designate robots as a strategic industry, providing support to ensure supply chain resiliency (stockpiling materials, fostering domestic suppliers, etc.). The Morgan Stanley “Humanoid 100” blueprint emphasizes scaling component suppliers in areas like precision gearboxes and drives , and we foresee similar focus industry-wide. In essence, while manufacturing ramp-up is a monumental task, our model assumes it is achievable with concerted effort and investment. The high scenario implicitly assumes no major hiccups in scaling – i.e., that by late 2030s, factories are pouring out robots almost as consumer electronics are churned out today. The low scenario might correspond to more hiccups – maybe factories prove more costly or slower to ramp, limiting supply and keeping prices higher . Adoption Dynamics and Labor Economics Humanoid robot adoption will not simply be a function of price and availability; it will also be driven by how they compare to human labor and the secondary effects of their deployment: Comparative Cost of Robot vs. Human Labor: As noted earlier , when the total cost of a robot falls below the annual cost of a human worker , businesses have a strong incentive to adopt robots. We model that the critical threshold is around the $20k per robot level for many jobs (since \$20k amortized ~\$1/hour). Once robots reach that price and demonstrate, say, at least 50% of a human’s productivity, they become economically attractive. ARK Invest found that at \$16k cost, a humanoid needs only a ~5% productivity advantage over a human worker (in NPV terms) to be viable . Our timelines align with robots hitting the \$10k–\$20k range by the late 2030s, exactly when we forecast inflection in adoption. This coupling isn’t coincidence – it’s cause and effect. We assume companies start rapid adoption as soon as the ROI case flips positive, and that cascades. As more firms adopt, their competitors must also to stay cost-competitive (automation race). We could see, for example, large warehouse operators in the late 2030s each racing to deploy tens of thousands of robots to reduce labor costs, much like automation waves in past decades with fixed robots or AI software. Induced Demand & New Use Cases: Another dynamic is induced demand – when a new capability becomes cheap, people find novel ways to use it. In our high-adoption scenario, we assume that ultra-low-cost robots (sub \$5k) unlock entirely new markets that aren’t replacing humans so much as doing tasks that were previously not done at all due to cost. For instance, personalized robot tutors or companions might become common if affordable. Households might have multiple robots for different specialized tasks (cleaning, security, gardening), whereas they would never hire that many servants. Small businesses might employ a fleet of micro-robots for on-demand local delivery – something uneconomical with human labor . This induced demand can significantly boost unit counts. It’s one reason the optimistic scenario surpasses global human population – because eventually there could be multiple robots per human , each fulfilling different roles (just as we now have multiple computers per person – phone, laptop, IoT devices). Our mid scenario is more• 53 43 • 5455 • 12 conservative on induced demand, assuming the primary driver is substitution of existing jobs and some new services. Network Effects and Systems Integration: Widespread adoption might also depend on ecosystems that make it easy to add robots. If companies like Amazon or Tesla provide a whole platform (robot + software + maintenance as a service), adoption can scale faster – a business can “subscribe” to robot labor with minimal friction. We assume by 2040s, such service models exist (robot-as-a-service contracts, leasing, etc.), which help diffuse robots even to smaller firms or households who don’t want large upfront costs. Peter Diamandis highlighted leasing as a way to get robot cost to \$10/day , making it a no-brainer expense for many. This kind of model is part of our assumption of rapid late adoption. Regulatory and Social Acceptance: We assume that regulation will generally adapt to allow large- scale robot deployment. Early on, safety standards and certifications will develop (ensuring robots can operate in public or workplaces without harming people). Governments might impose rules (like requiring a “robot driver’s license” of sorts for autonomous function in populated areas). There is a risk that fear of job displacement or accidents could lead to protectionist policies (e.g., banning robots in certain jobs to protect employment). Our mid-case assumes a balanced approach: some initial restrictions, but ultimately regulators permit broad use because economic gains are compelling and safety technology proves reliable. Social acceptance is likely to grow over time; younger generations might be more comfortable with robot colleagues or caregivers. If public sentiment turned sharply against automation, adoption could slow (low scenario in part could reflect political pushback limiting usage). Global Variation: We assume faster adoption in countries with high labor costs or shortages (e.g., North America, Western Europe, East Asia) and slower in regions with abundant cheap labor (some developing countries). However , even in the latter , aging populations (e.g., China itself faces aging) and rising wages will lead to eventual adoption. The implication is a potential automation gap in the 2030s between advanced and developing economies, but by 2060, we believe robots proliferate worldwide due to how cheap and capable they become. It’s notable that by 2060, BofA expects most robots to be in homes – that suggests penetration beyond just high-tech industries, into everyday life globally. In summation, our adoption modeling isn’t just a raw economic model – it accounts for feedback loops (competition), new demand generation, and policy factors . The mid scenario can be thought of as “business as usual + moderate policy support”, while the high scenario is “techno-optimistic + minimal friction”, and the low is “slower tech + significant societal friction”. Speculative but Plausible Innovations Several breakthrough technologies on the horizon could dramatically influence the capabilities, costs, and adoption of humanoid robots. While our core model doesn’t hinge on any one of these, we do consider their potential impacts, especially in the high scenario: Polymer Actuators & Artificial Muscles: Today’s robots largely use rotary electric motors and gearboxes at joints. These are rigid, heavy, and expensive precision components. An alternative is soft actuators – materials that contract/expand like muscles when stimulated (for example,• 41 • • 25 • 13 electroactive polymer muscles or shape-memory alloys) . Significant R&D is ongoing in artificial muscles for robotics . If successful, polymer actuators could replace many motors, simplifying design (no complex gears) and potentially cutting costs. They could also be lighter and more compliant (safer around humans). A breakthrough in this area by 2040 could allow the next generations of humanoids to be cheaper, more efficient, and more human-like in movement . We flagged this in our assumptions as a possible “step-change”: polymer actuators mass-produced like rolls of material could reduce reliance on rare-earth magnets and precision machining, lowering cost per joint dramatically. Our high scenario cost floor (<\$1000) almost certainly would require something like this to avoid the cost of dozens of high-precision motors. Advanced AI & LLM Control Stacks: Rapid progress in AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models, is expected to enhance robot intelligence. By connecting LLMs to robotic control (an active area of research), robots gain the ability to interpret complex instructions, generalize learning across tasks, and even program themselves at a high level. In 2025, researchers demonstrated an “embodied LLM” system using GPT-4 that enabled a robot to plan and execute multi- step tasks (like making coffee) in unpredictable environments . Generative AI can imbue robots with flexible problem-solving and natural language communication abilities . We assume that by the 2030s, robot control stacks heavily incorporate AI – possibly running on-board or via the cloud – allowing users to simply tell a robot what to do in plain English (or any language) and have it figure out the steps. This significantly broadens usability (no need for expert programming) and could accelerate adoption in non-technical domains. We also foresee AI-driven improvements in robot autonomy and safety : an AI that learns from millions of robot-hours of data could make robots exceedingly adept at avoiding accidents, handling edge cases, etc., smoothing regulatory concerns. In essence, smarter robots are more useful robots, and AI is the key to that. Our base case expects steady AI improvement, while our high case assumes one or two major AI leaps (perhaps an AI system that gives robots near-human cognitive flexibility by 2040). Solid-State Batteries and Energy Storage: As mentioned, battery improvements can reduce weight and cost. Solid-state batteries (SSB) , expected to emerge in the 2030s, offer higher energy density, faster charging, and improved safety (no fire risk) compared to lithium-ion. For humanoid robots, SSBs could double the runtime or halve the weight of the power pack – both valuable. Longer runtime means higher effective productivity (less frequent charging or battery swaps), making robots more attractive in operations. Weight savings improve agility and reduce joint stress, potentially extending robot life. We factor incremental battery improvements into our assumptions (not a game-changer for cost, but for performance). If SSBs or even more exotic energy storage (fuel cells, etc.) matured faster , robots might overcome one current limitation: relatively short operation times on battery. By 2060, we anticipate energy storage is a solved problem (robots can likely run all day via either ultra-fast charging, wireless charging spots, or simply very efficient power use). We don’t foresee energy being a limiting factor in adoption by mid-century. Materials Science and Durability: Other innovations could include self-healing materials (robots that can self-repair minor wear), lightweight composites (reducing structure weight while keeping strength), and improved lubricants or coatings reducing maintenance. 3D printing advances might allow custom robot parts to be made cheaply on demand (helping maintenance and local production). All these contribute to lowering effective cost and hassle of robots, thereby promoting adoption.5657 58 • 5960 5161 • • 14 Human-Enhancing Synergies: There could also be innovations in how humans and robots interact – e.g., exoskeleton robots that amplify human workers (blurring lines between a tool and an autonomous robot). While not a direct factor in our forecast, such technology could ease acceptance (people working with robots to extend their capabilities, rather than being replaced outright, at least in transition). In summary, we include a fudge factor for innovation upside in our high scenario. The world of 2060 will have technologies we can barely imagine today; some of them will undoubtedly intersect with robotics. The more breakthroughs occur , the faster costs fall and the more capabilities expand, pushing adoption to the upper bounds of our estimates. We have cited current research where possible to show these are not fantasy but active development areas. That said, our mid-case doesn’t rely on any specific breakthrough – “just” the continuation of current trends. Strategic Implications for Stakeholders The projected trajectory of humanoid robots carries profound strategic implications across the board – from investors and businesses to governments and workers. Here we summarize a few key insights and recommendations: For Investors and Industries: The humanoid robotics sector appears poised to become one of the largest industries in the world by mid-century, comparable to or exceeding the auto industry in scale . Morgan Stanley sizes the opportunity at ~$5 trillion annual revenue by 2050 , and others see eventual markets in the tens of trillions . For investors, this means significant value creation potential in robot manufacturers (e.g., firms like Tesla, which is cited as having a major first-mover advantage ), AI software providers, and critical component suppliers (actuators, sensors, chips) . There will also be new service industries around robots – maintenance, robot “training”, fleet management, etc. Companies should prepare strategies to integrate robots into their operations to boost productivity, similar to how PCs and the internet became universal business tools. Executives should start by exploring pilot use cases now , upskilling their workforce to work alongside or manage robots. Those that adopt early and learn will have a competitive edge in efficiency. Conversely, firms that ignore the robot trend risk being left behind with higher costs. Investors may want to evaluate which industries are most likely to benefit (e.g., logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, retail) and which might face disruption (e.g., labor-intensive services). Notably, a massive deployment of robots could increase supply and economic output significantly , potentially lowering inflationary pressures in the long run but also altering the landscape of labor . For Policymakers and Governments: Humanoid robots raise both opportunities and challenges for societies. On one hand, they promise solutions to aging population dilemmas (robots caring for the elderly or filling in workforce gaps) and productivity boosts. Countries that lead in robotics could see national productivity growth surge (some analyses even suggest double-digit annual GDP growth in robot- embracing nations in the 2040s ). It thus becomes a national strategic imperative to foster a domestic robotics ecosystem. Governments should consider policies such as R&D incentives, subsidies or tax breaks for automation adoption, and public-private partnerships to build robot manufacturing hubs . This is especially crucial given the geopolitical dimension: if, say, China controls the lion’s share of robot production and IP, other countries might find themselves dependent on foreign “digital workers” much as they are on foreign oil. National security planners are already looking at robotics as a dual-use technology (civil and military) that can confer strategic advantage .• 6263 3 6465 53 43 66 49 42 2867 6869 15 Policymakers must also grapple with the labor market impact . Millions of jobs could be augmented or outright automated by robots over several decades. To mitigate social disruption, governments should invest in workforce retraining and education – preparing humans for jobs that robots cannot easily do (or entirely new jobs created by robotics growth). For instance, demand for robot maintenance technicians, AI developers, and robot operators will rise. Creating pathways for displaced workers to move into these roles is vital. Some have proposed measures like a robot tax or UBI (universal basic income) if job displacement becomes severe; these ideas may enter mainstream policy debate if robot adoption accelerates as expected. We do note that historically, technological revolutions eventually create more jobs than they displace, but the transition can be painful if not managed. Policymakers should aim for a “ just transition ” – perhaps by incentivizing companies to reskill workers rather than simply laying them off. Another area is regulation and ethics : ensuring robots are deployed safely and responsibly. Governments will need to update labor laws, safety standards, and liability frameworks. For example, if a robot causes injury, who is liable – the manufacturer , the owner , or the robot (via insurance)? These questions require new regulatory thinking. Additionally, privacy issues may arise if robots are equipped with cameras and always on in workplaces or homes – data governance will be important. For Industrial Planners and Urban Planners: As robots proliferate in factories and logistics, facility designs may change (e.g., warehouses optimized for robot workers, with different layouts). Industrial planners should anticipate more lights-out facilities (fully automated plants) by the 2040s, and plan infrastructure (like power supply, networking) accordingly. Robots might also influence urban environments – e.g., autonomous delivery bots, maintenance robots for infrastructure. City planners might incorporate robot-friendly design (like delivery robot lanes or charging stations in buildings). On the macro scale, countries may face shifts in comparative advantage: cheap human labor has been a driver for manufacturing in developing nations, but if robot labor is cheap universally, manufacturing could localize back to consumer markets (since labor cost differences vanish). This might rebalance global supply chains – something policymakers and industrial strategists should monitor . Regions that invest early in robotics could attract new manufacturing (a robotic factory can be placed anywhere, so other factors like energy cost, proximity to market, and supportive policy will drive location). Thus, there is an opportunity for re- industrialization of high-income countries via robotics , which planners should facilitate through infrastructure and incentives. Geopolitical Considerations: The rise of humanoid robots could become a geopolitical flashpoint. As one analyst noted, “If nuclear arms and space race rivalries defined the 20th century, the 21st will be shaped by the race for intelligent labor” . Countries may worry about falling behind in AI and robotics; alliances could form to secure supply chains. We might even see trade tensions if some nations dump cheap robots on the market affecting others’ labor forces. It’s imperative for international bodies to discuss frameworks (perhaps a *“Geneva Convention” for AI and robots) to ensure beneficial development. For example, sharing standards and best practices can help avoid accidents or misuse. On the flip side, there’s a scenario where abundant robot labor reduces competition for low-wage jobs globally and could alleviate some migration pressures and sweatshop labor issues – a positive if managed well. Ethical and Social Implications: Finally, beyond economics and strategy, there are societal questions. If robots handle more caregiving, how do we maintain human empathy and contact for those who need it? How do we prevent devaluation of human labor and ensure dignity for displaced workers? These are beyond the scope of this paper , but strategic leaders should keep them in mind. Preparing the public through dialogue about the coming changes can help build acceptance. Emphasizing that robots can take7071 72 16 over “dirty, dangerous, dull” jobs, while humans can focus on more creative, interpersonal, or high-level work, is a narrative that can encourage positive reception. In conclusion, the strategic landscape of the 21st century will likely be defined by the rise of physical AI in the form of humanoid robots . Stakeholders at all levels should treat this not as science fiction but as a near- inevitable shift, one that must be proactively planned for . Those who embrace and shape this trend – investing in the technology, crafting thoughtful policies, and preparing their workforce – stand to reap enormous benefits. Those who ignore it risk being swept aside by competitors or overwhelmed by its societal impacts. The time to engage with the humanoid robot future is now, while it is still in a nascent phase. As this whitepaper has outlined, the trajectory through 2060 points to a world where robots are as commonplace as vehicles or computers, fundamentally altering our economic and social fabric. Preparing for that reality is both the challenge and the opportunity of our time. References: Korus, S. (2024). How ARK Is Thinking About Humanoid Robotics. ARK Invest – Analyst Research.
