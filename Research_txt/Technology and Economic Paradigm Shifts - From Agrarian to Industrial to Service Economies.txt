Technology and Economic Paradigm Shifts: From Agrarian to Industrial to Service Economies Introduction: Epochal Shifts Driven by Technology Throughout history, societies have undergone paradigm shifts in their economies – from agrarian to industrial, and then to service-based systems – and each of these transformations has been propelled by technological innovation . This progression of structural transformation – moving labor from agriculture to manufacturing to services – has been observed in virtually all countries that achieved high incomes . In agrarian pre-industrial societies, the vast majority of people labored on farms; the Industrial Revolution introduced machines and new energy sources that reallocated labor to factories; and by the late 20th century, advanced economies evolved into predominantly service and knowledge economies . Crucially, technology has been the catalyst for each epochal shift: from the domestication of plants and animals that enabled agrarian society, to steam power and mechanization that fueled industrialization, to computers and automation that underpin today’s service and information age. In parallel, the nature of work itself has shifted – jobs based on physical strength and manual skill have given way to roles requiring cognitive ability and human empathy – because machines progressively took over routine, physical tasks. This report delves into these three major economic epochs, examining technology’s role in each, the fundamental shifts in labor and skills, and the characteristics of technologies that drive such transformative change . The Agrarian Age: Pre-Industrial Economies and Early Technology For millennia before industrialization, agrarian economies dominated. The primary sector (agriculture) accounted for the bulk of production and employment. In pre-modern societies, a large majority of the population farmed to produce enough food for subsistence . For example, in England around 1380, an estimated 78% of male workers were in agriculture , and even in 1700 roughly 47% of English men worked on farms . In Colonial America, upward of 90–95% of the population were farmers in the late 18th century . These figures underscore that agrarian labor was the backbone of early economies, with most human energy devoted to planting, harvesting, and tending livestock. Technology in the agrarian era was relatively static, but not insignificant. Pre-industrial farmers relied on simple tools (plows, sickles, hoes) and animal power , and over time there were gradual improvements – e.g. the adoption of the heavy plow, horse collar , improved crop rotations, and inventions like Jethro Tull’s seed drill (1701) – which boosted agricultural productivity. Such innovations constituted an “agricultural revolution” that, even before factories, began to free some labor from the land . In England, for instance, rising farm productivity by the 18th century meant fewer farmers could feed the population : by 1700, England no longer suffered famines despite a much smaller share of the workforce in farming , and it even became a net grain exporter . This indicates that technological and organizational improvements (from better tools to new crops and farming methods) had dramatically raised labor productivity in agriculture. Ultimately, however , the agrarian economy remained constrained by the productivity of human and animal muscle. Physical strength and endurance were paramount for work – plowing fields, harvesting by hand,1 2 3 4 5 6 1 and other farm tasks demanded arduous manual labor . The limits of this regime set the stage for a transformational leap: the application of new energy sources and machines to human labor . The Industrial Revolution: Technology Transforms Production and Labor The Industrial Revolution (late 18th to 19th century) marked the first great economic paradigm shift from agrarian to industrial . Centered initially in Britain and later spreading globally, industrialization was fundamentally technology-driven . Breakthrough inventions – especially general-purpose technologies like the steam engine – enabled a quantum leap in productive capacity. Steam power mechanized production, from pumping water out of mines to powering textile looms and locomotives. By the early 1800s, factories equipped with steam-powered machinery began mass-producing goods on a scale impossible with hand labor . Other key innovations included improved iron-making, machine tools, and the railroad – technologies that collectively revolutionized manufacturing and transportation . Industrialization is defined as the transformation of an economy from agrarian focus to mechanized manufacturing , and it is typically accompanied by higher incomes and living standards . Indeed, the 19th-century industrial innovations not only increased output of goods, but also spurred growth in supporting sectors like transport, finance, and communications to distribute and manage the new production . As technology automated and scaled up production, the structure of the labor force changed dramatically . Mechanization in agriculture (e.g. the mechanical reaper in 1831, and later tractors and harvesters) meant that far fewer workers were needed on farms to produce the same food. At the same time, factories and mines created entire new categories of jobs in the secondary (industrial) sector . People left rural villages in droves to seek work in urban industrial centers – a massive rural-to-urban migration fueled by the promise of factory wages . In the United States, for example, the share of workers in agriculture plummeted from about 60% of all U.S. employment in 1850 to under 15% by 1940 . Over the same period, manufacturing’s share of employment surged. The U.S. saw hundreds of new factory towns spring up between 1880 and 1940, as manufacturing absorbed workers leaving the land . By 1960, manufacturing jobs peaked at roughly 26% of U.S. employment (up from only ~17% in 1850) . A similar pattern unfolded across Europe and other regions: Britain’s agricultural workforce fell below 30% by the mid-19th century (from nearly half in 1700) , and countries like Germany, France, Japan, and later many Asian “Tiger” economies rapidly industrialized in the 20th century, shifting millions of workers into manufacturing. Notably, every country that became a modern high-income economy went through this shift . Even in recent decades, emerging economies have replayed the pattern: for instance, one-third of China’s workforce – hundreds of millions of people – moved out of agriculture between 1990 and 2015 amid China’s industrial boom . Technology was the engine of this industrial-era labor reallocation . Crucially, industrial technologies did not just create factory jobs; they also destroyed or displaced many traditional jobs , forcing adaptation. Mechanized textile mills, for example, made hand spinners and weavers obsolete, while agricultural machines displaced farm laborers. Yet in the long run, technology proved to be a net creator of jobs, as new industries and services emerged to absorb displaced workers . By raising productivity dramatically, industrial tech made goods cheaper and incomes higher , fueling demand for other goods and services and thereby creating new employment opportunities. Still, the transition could be painful: during the early Industrial Revolution, many workers saw stagnant wages and poor conditions even as national productivity7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 1516 4 17 18 2 climbed (a source of social unrest and the Luddite movement). Over time, however , labor conditions and skills adjusted to the new technological paradigm , with rising education levels and the development of skilled trades, professional managers, and engineers to build and operate complex machinery. In summary, the industrial epoch was characterized by a mass shift of labor from farms to factories , enabled by mechanization and new energy sources. Human labor became far more productive through automation of physical tasks : machines took over much of the heavy lifting and repetitive motion that had once relied on human or animal muscle. Consequently, the nature of work began to shift from pure physical exertion toward operation and oversight of machines. The average factory job still demanded manual dexterity and stamina , but also introduced routine cognitive elements (following procedures, timing workflows) and a need for basic literacy/numeracy (to read instructions, measure outputs, etc.). By the end of the industrial era, many workers were machine operators or assembly line workers – roles that were physical but in a very different way than pre-industrial farm labor , often involving repetitive, standardized tasks in an organized production process. The Rise of the Service Economy: Post-Industrial Transformation By the mid-20th century, advanced economies began yet another major shift – from industrial (manufacturing) dominance to a service-oriented economy . This post-industrial transition was first observed in the United States and Western Europe and has since become a global trend. Several drivers underpinned the rise of the tertiary sector (services) , but once again technology was front and center . The early decades after World War II saw rapid improvements in industrial productivity (through automation, better machinery, and later computerization) which meant fewer workers could produce more manufactured goods . Manufacturing output kept growing in many countries, but it required progressively less labor input due to automation and efficiency gains. For example, in the U.S. manufacturing’s share of employment peaked around 1960 and then began a long decline – falling from ~26% of jobs in 1960 to under 10% by the 2010s – even as factories became more productive than ever . Freed from manufacturing, labor shifted into services of all kinds: retail, finance, healthcare, education, entertainment, information technology, and more. By the early 21st century, the service sector accounted for by far the largest share of employment and GDP in advanced economies. The U.S. illustrates this starkly: services grew from roughly 18% of employment in 1850 to nearly 70% by 1980 , and today about four out of five U.S. workers are in service industries (over 80% of GDP) . Similarly, countries like the UK, France, and Japan now have around 70%–80% of workers in services, and even globally the service sector is the largest portion of economic activity . What technologies spurred the service economy? Several innovations mid-20th century onward played a role. One was the proliferation of consumer appliances and agricultural machinery that reduced the need for domestic labor and farm labor , indirectly boosting demand for services as people spent time and income elsewhere. More directly, the advent of computing and information technology in the late 20th century was a game-changer – often dubbed the “Third Industrial Revolution” or the rise of the knowledge economy . General-purpose computers (and later the Internet) enabled the automation of many routine information-processing tasks (from bookkeeping to inventory management), radically improving productivity in sectors like finance, administration, and communications. Information technology became a general-purpose technology (GPT) for the service era, analogous to steam or electricity in earlier eras, by providing a versatile platform that transformed how businesses operate. As a result, companies in the service sector rapidly adopted new IT systems to increase speed, efficiency, and scale , often reducing the number of employees needed for certain operations . For instance, banking embraced ATMs and online12 1920 21 2223 24 3 services (automating routine teller tasks), retail adopted barcode scanners and later e-commerce, and telecommunications evolved from manual switchboards to digital networks. Importantly, even as technology automated some service tasks, it also created entirely new service industries . The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw the rise of sectors like software development, IT consulting, digital marketing, and online media – service industries that simply did not exist before computers. Every wave of innovation spawned new types of jobs : for example, the introduction of personal computers led to millions of jobs in IT and across industries that use IT . Thus, technology both enabled the shift to services and expanded the scope of services the economy could offer . Another force in the shift toward services was rising incomes and changing demand patterns. Once societies achieved a certain level of material abundance (ample food and manufactured goods), consumers devoted a larger share of spending to services – better education, healthcare, travel, entertainment, etc. High productivity in farming and manufacturing (thanks to technology) made basic goods cheaper , freeing up income for services. This demand-side pull reinforced the labor shift. However , it’s crucial to note that without the technology-driven productivity gains in the goods-producing sectors, the labor and resources could not have been freed to grow the service sector . In that sense, these paradigm shifts literally only happened because technology raised productivity enough to allow new sectors to flourish. As one analysis of long-run employment changes notes, in the period 1850–2015 the U.S. lost massive numbers of farm and factory jobs due to new technologies, but those were more than offset by new jobs in emerging sectors – a historical pattern of creative destruction that suggests technology’s net effect is job creation in the long run . By the turn of the 21st century, service economies are characterized by industries delivering intangibles (experiences, knowledge, care) rather than tangible goods. Countries highly oriented around services are considered more “advanced” in economic structure , and indeed a high service share correlates with high GDP per capita. It’s important to recognize, however , that industry and services are deeply interlinked (manufacturers rely on design, marketing, logistics services, etc., and many services use manufactured equipment). The lines between sectors have blurred – e.g. tech companies produce digital “products” which are in effect services, and manufacturers increasingly bundle services with goods. Nonetheless, the post- industrial epoch clearly places a premium on information handling, specialized knowledge, and human- centric services, in contrast to the raw material extraction and mass production emphasis of prior epochs. From Muscle to Mind: How Labor and Skills Have Shifted Fundamentally Hand in hand with these economic shifts, the nature of work and the skills demanded from labor have fundamentally changed . In the agrarian age, typical work was highly physical – plowing fields, harvesting crops, tending animals – requiring strength, endurance, and practical know-how passed down through experience. People’s livelihoods depended on manual labor and dexterity , often with the whole family working long hours to eke out productivity from the land. Cognitive skills (like formal education) or “people skills” were less economically central for the majority; a farmer’s value was in their ability to do strenuous work and master the rhythms of agriculture, rather than in reading, calculation, or nuanced communication. Empathy and social intelligence certainly existed in pre-industrial communities, but most jobs did not explicitly demand these softer skills for performance.25 26 27 4 The industrial era began to alter this profile. Many industrial jobs were still manual – factory operatives, machinists, assembly line workers, miners, railroad builders – but human muscle power started to be augmented and partially replaced by machine power . As a result, pure brawn became less central than the ability to operate and interface with machinery . Workers needed to learn specific, often repetitive operations (e.g. tending a spinning machine or assembling parts), placing a premium on manual precision and efficiency over raw strength. Moreover , industrialization brought about a greater division of labor and specialization, which meant many workers performed a narrow range of tasks with machine-like consistency. This introduced the concept of routine jobs – some manual (e.g. assembly line work) and some clerical (e.g. basic bookkeeping in an office) – where following set procedures was key. At the same time, new white-collar and skilled trades jobs emerged (engineers, accountants, managers, technicians) requiring formal education, technical knowledge, and problem-solving ability – cognitive skills that were previously not widespread in the labor force. Thus, as the industrial economy matured, literacy and basic technical education became increasingly important even for working-class people. By the mid-20th century, high school education (and some vocational training) was often necessary to get a good factory or office job. In short, the industrial paradigm shifted many workers from purely “doing” to also “operating and monitoring” – the work still involved physical activities, but guided by set rules and some cognitive oversight. In the post-industrial service economy , the balance has shifted decisively toward jobs that rely on knowledge, information processing, and human interaction . As automation and computers took over routine tasks (both physical and computational), the fastest-growing job segments became those emphasizing either high-level cognitive skills or social and emotional skills – or both . On one end, there is huge growth in cognitive nonroutine jobs – for example, professional and technical roles in management, science, education, finance, and technology – which demand problem-solving, creativity, and analytical thinking. These jobs are less physical and more about working with information and ideas; they often require higher education and continuously learning new skills. On the other end, many service jobs are in personal services (hospitality, food service, caregiving, etc.) which are manual nonroutine roles – they may involve physical work (like cooking, cleaning, or assisting patients), but crucially they require adaptability and human interaction rather than repetitive motion. Indeed, economists have observed a polarization where routine jobs decline and growth happens in both high-skill cognitive roles and in-service roles that require interpersonal skills and situational adaptability . A defining feature of service work is the premium on communication, emotional intelligence, and empathy . Many service-economy occupations – from teachers and nurses to customer service representatives and salespeople – hinge on the ability to understand and work with other people’s needs. These are skills that machines and algorithms (so far) cannot replicate well . As one NBER study notes, social interaction is perhaps the most essential workplace task for which there is “no good machine substitute” – even advanced software struggles with the nuance of a simple unstructured human conversation . Likewise, roles that involve complex decision-making in uncertain situations (something humans handle with intuition and experience) have grown in importance . The upshot is that human labor has shifted from doing what machines can do, to doing what machines cannot (yet) do . In agrarian and early industrial times, strength and mechanical skills were at a premium; in the 21st-century economy, brainpower and social skills are the comparative advantage of human workers . The average worker today spends far less time on physical drudgery (machines and automated processes handle much of that) and far more time on tasks requiring judgment, creativity, teamwork, and empathy. Even in manufacturing and technical fields, modern workers often operate in teams, solve problems, and adapt to new processes – a far cry from the rote, repetitive factory work of the early 20th century. This trend will only2829 3031 29 29 3233 3435 5 continue as automation encroaches on routine cognitive tasks (e.g. algorithms handling data entry or basic analysis), pushing human work toward higher-order thinking and human-to-human interaction. It’s important to emphasize that this shift in skills was made possible by technology and also necessitated by it. As machines took over physical tasks, workers had to up-skill or re-skill to remain employable – gaining more education and focusing on cognitive/creative strengths. Simultaneously, technology created tools (from personal computers to software applications) that augment human intelligence and allow workers to handle more complex tasks. The overall effect is that today’s jobs, on average, demand much more education and mental skill than jobs a century ago . This is evident in metrics like the rise in high school and college graduation rates over the 20th century in industrialized nations and the increasing returns to education in the labor market . Furthermore, “soft skills” (communication, teamwork, adaptability) have gained recognition as critical for success in the modern workplace . Employers frequently cite teamwork and communication as among the hardest-to-find yet most valued skills in new hires . All of these point to a labor force that has moved from “strong backs” to “strong minds and interpersonal savvy.” Technological Drivers of Paradigm Shifts: Automation and General- Purpose Innovations Looking across these epochal transitions, a key question emerges: what kind of technology causes fundamental paradigm shifts in the economy and jobs? History suggests that certain technologies – often termed General-Purpose Technologies (GPTs) – are the primary drivers of epochal change. GPTs are innovations so powerful and flexible that they permeate all sectors of the economy and lead to widespread reorganization of economic activity . They typically have several defining characteristics: they affect an entire economy , can be improved continuously, have many varied uses, and generate spillover innovations in complementary areas . In essence, a true GPT is transformative and pervasive . Classic examples include the steam engine , which was the linchpin of the first Industrial Revolution; electricity , which powered the second industrial revolution and the modern industrial infrastructure; and information technology (computers and the Internet), which underlies the current information age . Each of these did not just improve productivity in one industry – they fundamentally altered the trajectory of economic development and society . For instance, steam power revolutionized transportation (railways, steamships) and manufacturing (steam-driven factories) all at once, unleashing urban industrial economies. Electricity, with its ability to deliver energy anywhere on-demand, enabled the assembly line, mass communication, and electrification of homes and factories, vastly boosting industrial and later service productivity. The microprocessor and the Internet likewise transformed how information is processed and shared, giving birth to industries and business models unimaginable in the industrial era. Another critical property of such technologies is their role in automation . Automation technologies – those that enable tasks to be performed with minimal human labor – have repeatedly precipitated paradigm shifts. For example, the mechanization of agriculture and textiles in the 18th–19th centuries was essentially an automation of manual labor through machines (mechanical automata replacing hand spinners, weavers, and ploughmen). Later , the automation of assembly lines (using conveyors and eventually industrial robots in the 20th century) dramatically increased manufacturing productivity, reducing the need for assembly workers and contributing to the manufacturing employment peak and subsequent decline. In the late 20th century, computer automation took off – first handling repetitive calculation and record-keeping tasks, and increasingly controlling complex processes (CNC machines,3637 38 39 40 41 40 6 automated logistics, etc.). Each wave of automation eliminated or diminished certain job categories while enabling new ones, thus restructuring the labor market. What makes automation technologies epoch- changing is their breadth of impact : they don’t just streamline one task, they end up being applied to myriad processes across industries. For instance, control theory and industrial automation (a mid-20th- century GPT ) not only changed manufacturing, but also agriculture (automatic milking machines), transportation (autopilot systems), and even services (ATM machines, call routing systems). The recent rise of artificial intelligence (AI) can be seen as the next GPT on the horizon, with the potential to automate aspects of cognition itself. Indeed, AI is often likened to a general-purpose technology in that it could eventually impact every sector , from driving cars to diagnosing diseases to customer service. History shows that when such broad-scope automation arrives, economies go through significant restructuring – as was the case with earlier GPTs. What “properties” of these technologies make them so disruptive? Several stand out: Dramatic Productivity Boosts: Paradigm-shifting tech offers orders-of-magnitude improvements in productivity. When a steam engine can do the work of dozens of horses, or a computer can perform millions of calculations per second, the economics of production are radically changed. This frees up resources (including human labor) for other uses , kickstarting structural change. For example, one modern combine harvester can reap in a day what previously took scores of farm workers – allowing those workers to move to industry or services. Similarly, automation in manufacturing meant the same output with far fewer workers, releasing labor for the growing service sector . Pervasiveness and Multiple Uses: A technology that only affects one niche industry (say, a better loom only for textiles) might increase output in that industry but won’t redefine the whole economy. GPTs, by contrast, have wide applicability . Electricity, for instance, powered factories, homes, streetlights, and new appliances – affecting manufacturing, household labor , and leisure simultaneously. Information technology found uses from payroll processing to airline reservations to personal communications. This ubiquity means the technology changes job requirements across the board . Workers in many occupations suddenly had to learn to use electric tools or computers, for instance, changing skill demands broadly. Enabling New Industries: Paradigm-shifting tech doesn’t just make old processes better; it also makes entirely new activities possible. The railroads (often considered a 19th-century GPT) not only improved transport but enabled the rise of national markets, tourism, and modern retail distribution. The Internet enabled e-commerce, online media, and cloud computing services – sectors that simply did not exist prior . This capacity to spawn new industries and services is what creates the new employment that eventually absorbs displaced workers . It’s a hallmark of GPTs that they are innovation platforms upon which other entrepreneurs build further applications. Complementary Innovations and Infrastructure: Big technological shifts often require and inspire complementary changes – in infrastructure (e.g. electrical grids, broadband networks), in business organization (e.g. assembly line organization with electrification, or agile management with IT), and in human capital (education systems to teach new skills). Thus, a paradigm shift is not a single invention but a cluster of innovations that form a new techno-economic paradigm. Once that cluster falls into place, old paradigms (and the jobs tied to them) recede. For example, mass production with interchangeable parts (another general-purpose manufacturing technique) required42 • 18 • • 4325 • 7 new management practices and worker training, but once adopted it spread widely . The synergy of inventions amplifies the impact on the economy and employment. Automation of Previous Bottlenecks: Each major epochal tech tends to automate the tasks that were the bottleneck of the previous era . In agrarian times, land and physical labor were bottlenecks – mechanization and chemical fertilizers automated physical labor and increased land yield. In industrial times, processing information and control became a bottleneck (managing complex production, logistics, calculations) – computers and digital networks automated those tasks. In services today, some of the remaining bottlenecks are human judgment, creativity, and social interaction . So far , these have proven hard to automate, which is why jobs requiring these human qualities have grown . Should AI reach a level where it can reliably automate those too, it could herald yet another paradigm – but that enters the realm of future speculation, which is beyond our historical focus here. In retrospect, we can identify key technologies that caused the agrarian-industrial-service shifts . The steam engine (and fossil-fuel power more generally) was fundamental to the agrarian→industrial shift – it provided a new general power source to replace human/animal muscle, enabling factories and railroads. Another was the suite of mechanized production tools (spinning jenny, power loom, etc.) that automated handcraft. For the industrial→service shift, computing and digital communication stand out – they automated many routine cognitive tasks and reduced the labor intensity of manufacturing and administration, while opening new frontiers in information services. Automation technologies like robotics also played a role by further reducing manufacturing labor needs late in the 20th century. Underlying both transitions, we also see the importance of earlier GPTs like electric power and the internal combustion engine – these actually straddle the first and second shift (they emerged in late 19th/early 20th century, boosting industrialization and also laying groundwork for new services like telecommunications, electric utilities, automobile-based commerce, etc.). In sum, paradigm-shifting technologies are those that fundamentally change the factor inputs of production (e.g. replacing muscle power with mechanical power, or human calculation with digital computation) and those that enable qualitatively new activities**. These technologies trigger economy-wide ripple effects, reorganizing industries and occupations on a grand scale. Figure: Long-run decline of agricultural employment (primary sector) as countries industrialize, showing England/ Wales leading the shift out of agriculture by the 19th century, followed by other European countries and later the United States. Advanced economies saw agricultural labor fall from the majority to a tiny fraction of the workforce over two centuries, as technology boosted farm productivity and labor moved to industry and services . (Source: The Cambridge Group; data for male labor force.) Conclusion: Technology as the Catalyst of Economic Epochs In examining the agrarian, industrial, and service epochs, a clear through-line emerges: technological innovation is the prime mover of economic paradigm shifts . It was the enabler that allowed societies to leap from one predominant mode of production to the next – farming to factory to information. Each transition was marked by the emergence of transformative general-purpose technologies (be it the plow and irrigation for agriculture, the steam engine and power loom for industry, or the computer and internet for the information age) that redefined what kinds of work were valuable. Consequently, the composition of employment changed: human labor migrated away from tasks that technology mastered (or made vastly more efficient) and toward tasks that were newly demanded or still uniquely human . Strength42 • 3435 4445 8 and manual skill gave way to cognitive, creative, and interpersonal competencies as economies developed. Moreover , these shifts were not automatic or easy; they involved substantial social adjustment – migration, new educational demands, and sometimes disruption of livelihoods – but ultimately they delivered higher productivity and wealth, enabling new jobs to appear . History demonstrates that the only reason such profound labor reallocations were possible is because technology raised productivity sufficiently to “free” workers for new sectors . When fewer hands were needed to feed the nation, those hands built the factories; when fewer were needed in factories, they moved into offices, hospitals, schools, and labs. Finally, understanding what kind of technologies precipitate epochal change offers insight into the future: it will likely be those innovations that, like past GPTs, can be applied broadly, automate fundamental categories of work , and serve as platforms for countless new applications. Past transitions teach us that technology’s impact is pervasive but paradoxically focused – it renders some skills obsolete while amplifying the importance of others. Thus far , each wave has ultimately augmented human economic capacity rather than diminishing it, creating new opportunities even as it destroys old ones . The agrarian, industrial, and service epochs are chapters in a continuing story of human work shaped by tools : at each juncture, our tools have redefined our economy and in doing so, have redefined us as workers. The historical record affirms that technology is not just a factor in economic change – it is the defining catalyst of the great economic epochs , driving us from the plow to the steam engine to the computer , and beyond. Sources: The analysis above is supported by historical data and research on structural transformation , employment shifts in the US and other countries , and economic studies on the role of general- purpose technologies and skills evolution in the labor market . Each epoch’s description and the role of technology are drawn from a synthesis of economic history and labor statistics (e.g., declining agricultural workforce and rising service sector) . The discussion on skills and labor characteristics references research on job polarization and the growing importance of cognitive and social skills as routine manual work is automated . The concept of GPTs and their economy-wide impact is documented in economic literature, with steam, electricity, and IT cited as archetypal examples . These sources collectively reinforce the conclusion that technology’s evolution underpins the grand shifts in economic structure and the nature of work.
