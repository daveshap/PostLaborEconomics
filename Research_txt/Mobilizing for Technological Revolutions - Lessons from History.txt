Mobilizing for Technological Revolutions: Lessons from History The U.S. Industrial Transition and the Great Depression In the early 20th century, the United States experienced rapid technological advancements – electrification, mass production, mechanized agriculture – yet its economic and social institutions struggled to adapt swiftly. Productivity boomed while demand and labor absorption lagged , contributing to the structural imbalances that precipitated the Great Depression. For example, agricultural productivity exploded after World War I thanks to tractors, fertilizers, and improved seeds; this “productivity shock” caused crop prices to collapse and forced many farmers off their land, swelling the ranks of the unemployed . The transition from horse-drawn to mechanized transport further freed up millions of acres (previously for feed crops) and displaced farm labor . Overall, 1929–1941 saw the fastest total factor productivity growth in U.S. history , but much of the benefit accrued to corporate profits rather than wages . Wages did not keep pace with output, so workers couldn’t afford to consume the glut of goods factories and farms produced (a classic overproduction-underconsumption spiral ). Companies, facing unsold inventories, cut back production and laid off workers, deepening unemployment . By 1933, roughly one in four American workers was jobless, and anxieties grew that technology was “eliminating jobs faster than they could be created,” as MIT’s president observed in 1938 . In short, industrialization raced ahead while the economy’s capacity to reemploy displaced labor and distribute income trailed , resulting in productivity abundance alongside mass unemployment – a key structural factor exacerbating the Depression . Federal intervention in the 1930s (e.g. New Deal public works and regulations) provided some relief, but by the late 1930s unemployment still hovered around 15%. The economy remained fragile and arguably was transitioning too slowly into the modern industrial era . This set the stage for an extraordinary external catalyst that would, in under a decade, force a full economic reorganization. World War II: A National-Scale Industrial Mobilization A World War II-era War Production Board poster urges Americans to recycle tin from everyday items for the war effort. WWII demanded all-encompassing national mobilization – from rationing consumer goods to converting entire industries to military production. World War II became, in effect, an Apollo Program-scale mobilization of American industry and manpower . Upon U.S. entry into the war , the government erected a centrally planned economy almost overnight. Under agencies like the War Production Board, Washington directed what factories produced, allocated raw materials, and even seized non-compliant companies – dramatically retooling the industrial base for maximum output . Key prices, wages, and resource allocations were administered rather than left to the market, and federal spending dominated investment . The results were astounding. Economic growth during WWII was the fastest in U.S. history , and unemployment evaporated. Between 1938 and 1944, U.S. unemployment fell by about 10 million people – from ~19% unemployment to1 2 34 54 67 14 89 810 1 essentially full employment . Millions of new jobs were created in munitions, shipbuilding, aircraft, vehicles and electronics, drawing in those left idle in the 1930s (including women entering industry and workers leaving less productive farm jobs) . Industrial productivity (output per hour) surged as the workforce shifted into more efficient factory work and as wartime demand spurred process innovations . By 1945 the U.S. was producing half of the world’s military armaments , an achievement made possible by the continental-scale industrial infrastructure that had been built or expanded during the war . This war-driven mobilization was analogous to a massive national mission : the government coordinated closely with private firms (often via cost-plus contracts) to meet explicit production targets – e.g. Detroit auto plants famously stopped making cars (only 139 civilian autos were made during the war vs. 3 million in 1941) and instead mass-produced tanks, trucks, aircraft and guns . Companies like Ford built bombers; Alcoa made warplanes; even toy and nail manufacturers converted to making military components . The war effort also prompted breakthroughs in technology (radar , jet engines, nuclear research, synthetic materials) and in organizational capacity (modern project management and logistics). By war’s end, the U.S. had an entirely new economic substrate : huge modern factories, a greatly enlarged skilled workforce (including returning soldiers educated under the 1944 G.I. Bill), and refined techniques for large-scale production . This formed the foundation for the post-1945 economic boom . Indeed, Gross National Product leapt from $200 billion in 1940 to $300 billion by 1950 (and over $500 billion by 1960) , firmly establishing the U.S. as the world’s preeminent industrial economy. World War II thus highlights how a deliberate, mission-driven mobilization can “shock” an economy out of stagnation. The war effort achieved in a few years what a peacetime market had struggled to do in a decade: absorb technological capacity, eliminate structural unemployment, and modernize industrial infrastructure . The lesson is not that war is a desirable solution, but that scale and coordination were key – a level of public-private coordination and investment akin to a giant “national project” (which could, in theory, be devoted to peaceful ends). Admiral Harold Bowen approvingly described wartime economic life as “quite completely regimented” in service of a common goal . This unprecedented state direction left a peacetime legacy: many experts later argued that the “wartime planning represents a lost model for effective public direction of the economy” in tackling big challenges . WWII showed that with political will, the U.S. could radically reorganize its economy – a peacetime equivalent might be something like the Apollo moonshot program, but on an even larger scale. Historical Precedents of Technological Revolution & Mobilization Major technological revolutions in other nations and eras have likewise been paired with deliberate political-economic restructuring . From the 19th century to recent decades, countries that successfully navigated rapid tech-driven change often did so via purposeful state intervention, industrial policy, or mission-focused campaigns (frequently in response to war or perceived crises). Below, we examine several key examples: Britain’s Industrial Revolution: Laissez-Faire Innovation and Naval Power The first Industrial Revolution (late 18th to mid-19th century) began in Britain, and notably, it unfolded with minimal direct state planning of industry. The British government had no formal industrialization policy – it largely adhered to laissez-faire principles, focusing its expenditures on the military and empire . Unlike later “late-industrializers,” Britain’s state did not own factories or railroads, and it gradually dismantled old mercantilist regulations (repealing the Corn Laws in 1846, for example, to cheapen food for11 1112 12 1314 1516 17 1819 2021 822 23 2425 2 workers) . This hands-off approach was unique to Britain ; elsewhere, governments more actively engineered or protected their industrial booms . However , Britain’s government did play enabling roles in the background. Institutional innovations after 1688 (secure property rights, patent laws, the rule of law, and the development of capital markets through the Bank of England and government bonds) created a favorable climate for private entrepreneurship . Moreover , Britain’s naval and colonial policies provided access to global markets and resources – the state’s powerful Navy protected trade routes and its colonies supplied raw materials and captive markets, indirectly spurring industrial growth . Wartime demand also stimulated key industries (e.g. the Napoleonic Wars drove advances in iron founding, mechanized textile production for uniforms, etc.). By the mid-19th century, Britain’s laissez-faire-industrial complex had proven remarkably successful in generating innovation (steam engines, railways, mechanized mills), but it was accompanied by social strains – harsh factory conditions and labor unrest eventually prompted the British state to step in with modest regulatory reforms (factory acts, urban sanitation) and investments in education late in the 19th century . In summary, Britain’s case shows that a favorable institutional framework and global strategy can catalyze a tech revolution even without an explicit “industrial policy.” Yet, it was the exception – as industrialization spread, most other nations opted for a more guided approach. Meiji Japan: State-Driven Modernization as National Mission Few examples illustrate deliberate techno-economic mobilization better than the Meiji Restoration in Japan (1868–1912) . Facing Western encroachment, Japan’s new Meiji leadership embarked on a crash course to industrialize and build state power . Feudal institutions were torn down virtually overnight : the samurai aristocracy was abolished, and a modern conscript army established . The government then poured national resources into industrial development as a matter of survival and pride. In the 1870s– 1880s, the Meiji state built railroads, telegraph lines, mines, shipyards, munitions works and dozens of factories across textiles, glass, cement, chemicals and more . Initially, many of these enterprises were government-owned and operated , jump-starting industries that were too nascent or capital-intensive for the private sector . By the 1880s, due to budget strains, the state began selling many factories to entrepreneurial families – forming the famous zaibatsu conglomerates (Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, etc.) – but continued to nurture them with subsidies, tariffs, and procurement . Alongside industrial policy, mass education and institutional reform underpinned Japan’s modernization: a national compulsory education system (launched 1872) achieved near-universal primary schooling by 1900, emphasizing not only technical skills but also a unifying ideology of duty to nation and emperor . The Meiji government also sent students and officials overseas to learn Western science and engineering, and it hired foreign experts in everything from railroad engineering to medicine (“oyatoi gaikokujin”) to train a generation of Japanese professionals . The result was that within a few decades, Japan emerged as Asia’s first industrialized nation , able to produce modern warships, arms, and consumer goods – and even to defeat a major European power (Russia in 1905) using its new industrial military. Crucially, this transformation was no accident of markets ; it was a conscious national mission executed via state capacity, public–private coordination, and social mobilization. By “concentrating on its own modernization” instead of resisting change, Japan avoided colonization and became a great power . Meiji Japan offers a model of mission-oriented development : the political will to restructure society (from abolishing feudal classes to changing education and legal systems) in order to embrace a new technological paradigm.2627 28 2930 3132 3334 3536 37 3839 40 4142 4344 3 Late-19th Century Continental Europe: National Industrial Strategies Industrialization in continental Europe often lagged Britain’s but was accelerated through deliberate state intervention and national strategy, especially in the late 19th century. For instance, Germany after unification (1871) rapidly became a world industrial leader by combining private enterprise with supportive government policy. The newly unified German state created a customs union (Zollverein) to integrate regional markets , adopted a single currency, and pursued protective tariffs to shield infant industries . State investment in infrastructure was pivotal – German authorities promoted and sometimes directly financed railroad expansion, knowing it would stimulate steel, coal, and engineering sectors . Indeed, railroads were Germany’s “central growth engine,” catalyzing mining, metals, and machine- building; by 1870 Germany had 25,000 km of rail (from virtually none in 1835) . The German state also fostered technical education and science aligned with industry needs – for example, founding technical universities and research institutes that partnered with firms (the Daimler and Benz inventions in automobiles, or Bayer in chemicals, benefited from this science-industrial nexus). By the 1880s, Germany not only caught up to Britain but was outproducing it in steel and dominating key advanced sectors like dyes and electrical equipment . Notably, Chancellor Bismarck’s government pioneered social policies (health, accident, and old-age insurance in the 1880s) to support the new industrial workforce . This early welfare state was partly a political maneuver to stave off socialist unrest, but it had economic benefits: a healthier , more secure workforce and greater social cohesion during rapid change . By 1913, industry comprised 60% of Germany’s GDP (up from near-zero a few generations earlier) – a stunning rise powered by public-private collaboration . Germany’s experience illustrates how state- guided mobilization (through tariffs, banking support, infrastructure, education, and social insurance) can propel latecomers to the forefront of a technological revolution. Other European nations followed similar paths. Imperial Russia in the late 19th century, under Finance Minister Sergei Witte, undertook a state-led “Great Spurt” of industrialization – building the Trans-Siberian Railway, promoting heavy industry via subsidies and tariffs, and courting foreign investment in Russian steel and oil. Though Russia remained less industrialized by World War I, these efforts did seed major industrial centers. France , after 1870, used state banks and colonial resources to support industry, and built an extensive railway network with government guarantees. In smaller countries like Sweden and Belgium , governments supported technical education and banking reforms that enabled industrial growth in steel, machinery, and chemicals. In summary, by the early 20th century the European norm was for governments to actively facilitate industrial modernization , whether by building infrastructure, protecting industries, or investing in human capital. The laissez-faire British scenario was the exception; more common was the “developmental state” approach , which recognized that mobilizing for a new technological era often required conscious political- economic effort. The Soviet Union: Five-Year Plans as Forced Industrial Revolution A stark example of top-down mobilization is the Soviet Union’s rapid industrialization during the interwar period. Under Stalin’s regime, the USSR launched a series of Five-Year Plans (starting in 1928) that essentially treated economic development as a war-like campaign against backwardness. The First Five-Year Plan prioritized heavy industries – steel, coal, machinery, electricity – at almost any cost. The government set prodigious production quotas and ruthlessly reallocated resources (including mass labor) to build mines, plants, and entire new industrial cities from scratch. The human costs were enormous (forced45 46 47 48 4950 5152 47 47 53 4 collectivization of agriculture led to famine; labor camp prisoners helped build infrastructure), yet the economic results were dramatic : between 1928 and 1940, the number of Soviet workers in industry, construction, and transport nearly tripled from 4.6 million to 12.6 million, and factory output soared . In little more than a decade, the USSR transformed from a primarily agrarian economy into the world’s second- largest industrial producer . By the eve of World War II, the Soviet Union was capable of producing modern armaments and had moved much of its industry east of the Ural Mountains for security . This militarized, coercive mobilization proved crucial in World War II – the USSR’s massive tank, artillery, and aircraft production (enabled by the 1930s industrial base) helped defeat the Nazi invasion. However , Soviet development came via authoritarian command rather than market or mixed-economy methods. The Soviet case shows that technological revolution can be forced extremely fast by sheer state fiat and sacrifice , though at the expense of consumer welfare and personal freedoms. While not a model any advanced democracy would emulate in method, it underlines how state capacity and planning can redirect an economy on a dime – an extreme form of mission-driven mobilization where the “mission” was to industrialize at all costs. Notably, the Soviet Union also achieved specific technological feats through directed efforts – for example, the Space Race : by 1957 it launched the first satellite (Sputnik) and in 1961 the first man in space, reflecting heavy state investment in STEM education and research during the post-war years. War Mobilizations of the 1930s–40s: Rearmament and Recovery The period leading up to and including World War II offers multiple examples of technology-driven mobilization under urgent national missions. We have seen the U.S. case. Similarly, Nazi Germany in the 1930s engineered an economic recovery through reindustrialization and rearmament. When Hitler took power in 1933, Germany was in a depression with over 6 million unemployed. The Nazi regime immediately launched massive public works (like the Autobahn highway network) and, in violation of the Versailles Treaty, a secret rearmament program. Government spending on armaments and infrastructure, along with removing women and Jews from the official labor force, drove unemployment down to effectively zero by the late 1930s . Military production orders for steel, chemicals, aircraft and vehicles acted as an industrial policy, resurrecting Germany’s factories. Germany’s mobilization was explicitly war-driven – a “military Keynesianism” that boosted heavy industry. By 1939, Germany had a formidable industrial war machine (though it came at the cost of distortions – consumer goods were scarce and real wages were tightly controlled) . This example reiterates that war or national security threats can trigger political leaders to undertake bold economic interventions that peacetime market logic might not allow, thereby accelerating technological adoption (e.g. jet engines, rocketry, synthetic fuels were all advanced under the Nazi war effort). In the United States, the New Deal of the 1930s can be viewed as a mild form of mission-oriented mobilization in peacetime. While not nearly as large as WWII efforts, New Deal policies treated the Depression as a national emergency: the federal government hired millions of unemployed in public works programs (building dams, roads, schools, electrical infrastructure via the TVA and WPA), thus spreading new technologies (rural electrification, mechanized construction techniques) and upskilling labor . The New Deal also invested in future human capital (through the CCC’s education programs and improved public schools) and set up financial reforms that stabilized banks. It increased the state’s role in economic management , creating capacity that later proved useful during the war (many New Deal administrators became wartime production administrators). Though the New Deal alone didn’t fully restore prosperity, it demonstrated that democratic governments could deliberately plan and execute large-scale economic initiatives in response to technological and social challenges . It laid precedent for peacetime “mobilization” in pursuits like54 5554 56 57 5 infrastructure and social welfare that would continue post-WWII (e.g. the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s). Post–World War II Reconstruction and Mission Economies After WWII’s devastation, deliberate economic restructuring was imperative in many countries – and it often doubled as an opportunity to leap forward technologically. In Western Europe , the Marshall Plan (1948– 52) exemplified mission-driven mobilization: the U.S.-funded plan injected capital for rebuilding infrastructure and industry, but also demanded pro-growth reforms (trade liberalization, stable currencies, collaborative planning among European nations). Countries like West Germany used Marshall Plan aid and their own social market policies to modernize factories with the latest machinery and to retrain workers. West Germany’s 1948 currency reform and removal of rationing unleashed entrepreneurial energy; combined with export-oriented industrial policy and vocational training programs, this produced the Wirtschaftswunder (“economic miracle”) – industrial production doubled in the 1950s . Japan , under U.S. Occupation, also rebuilt rapidly: a wide-reaching economic reorganization dissolved the old zaibatsu monopolies (temporarily), implemented land reform to create a middle-class consumer base, and empowered the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to guide postwar industrial policy. By the 1950s, as Japan regained sovereignty, MITI actively coordinated industry rationalization – focusing investment in strategic sectors (first coal and steel, later automobiles, shipbuilding, and electronics) . The Japanese government maintained strict controls on imports and foreign exchange in the early years, ensuring domestic industries could grow. Industrial production in Japan rebounded from only 27% of pre-war output in 1946 to 350% of pre-war output by 1960 – an astonishing recovery. A key reason was the mission-oriented economic management by the state : Japan saw economic revival as a national mission, with slogans like “Inclined Production” prioritizing coal and steel to fuel all other industries . The Korean War (1950) ironically aided Japan’s miracle by providing a surge in orders for its factories (a “proxy” mobilization) . By the 1960s, Japan’s government-business collaboration (through mechanisms like keiretsu conglomerates linked by banks, and high targets set by Prime Minister Ikeda’s Income Doubling Plan) resulted in ~10% annual GDP growth . Japan’s state guided credit to strategic industries – e.g. the Japan Development Bank directed 83% of its financing in one period to shipbuilding, electric power, coal, and steel – which built competitive advantage in sectors that drove postwar growth . This underscores how public investment and industrial policy in reconstruction can yield long-term prosperity when aligned with a technological vision (in Japan’s case, becoming a leader in autos, electronics, etc., by design). Elsewhere, post-colonial states and Cold War development plans echoed these themes. South Korea in the 1960s–70s, under President Park Chung-hee, is a notable case of non-violent mission-oriented mobilization . Korea was a poor , war-torn agrarian nation in 1960. Park’s regime made economic development its top priority – essentially a war against poverty and underdevelopment. The state implemented a series of Five-Year Economic Plans and aggressively promoted industrialization through export-oriented industrial policy . Government ministries worked hand-in-hand with a few large family- run conglomerates ( chaebol like Samsung, Hyundai) – providing them preferential credit, tax incentives, protection from imports, and targets to meet . The government built infrastructure (ports, highways) to support industry and invested heavily in technical education. South Korea guaranteed loans for chosen firms and channeled foreign aid and technology to them , expecting in return rapid growth in heavy industries and exports . This highly coordinated approach paid off: South Korea achieved some of the fastest growth rates in the world (often >8% per year for decades), evolving into an industrial economy (steel, shipbuilding, cars, electronics) by the 1980s. The transformation was explicitly mission-58 5960 61 59 62 6364 65 6667 6668 6 driven – “nation-building” via industrial strength – and was successful largely due to strong state capacity to execute plans and a cooperative (if authoritarian) government–business relationship. By the 1990s, South Korea was a newly advanced economy, a testament to peaceful large-scale mobilization for a technological shift (from agriculture to high-tech industry) within a single generation . China offers a contemporary example of vast mission-oriented restructuring. After the turmoil of Mao’s era, Deng Xiaoping’s “Reform and Opening” (from 1978) constituted a strategic mobilization to modernize China’s economy with market mechanisms while retaining state direction. The Communist Party essentially treated economic catch-up as its new mission (shifting from class struggle to “Four Modernizations” in agriculture, industry, science/technology, and defense). In practice, China’s government liberalized agriculture and small enterprise , but simultaneously poured resources into industrial infrastructure, special economic zones, and human capital . The state maintained control of banking and heavy industries, using these levers to guide investment into manufacturing, export industries, and later high-tech sectors. This combination of market incentives with strategic planning yielded an “economic miracle”: over the ensuing decades, China’s GDP grew on average ~9.5% per year (1978–2013) – an unprecedented sustained growth wave . Hundreds of millions were moved from farms into factories, mega-cities and transport networks were built, and China became the world’s manufacturing hub. The government’s high-level goals (like becoming a world leader in certain technologies) were backed by industrial policies such as the recent “Made in China 2025” plan which targets AI, robotics, aerospace, and more. In short, China’s rise was not an accident ; it was orchestrated through mission-style five-year plans, massive state investments in infrastructure and R&D, and public-private partnerships (often via state-owned enterprises and incentivized private firms). Even though it was “non-violent,” it was a mobilization on the scale of a war effort – but aimed at economic and technological catch-up. Across these cases – from Meiji Japan to postwar Europe, from Soviet five-year plans to Asian Tiger economies – certain common mechanisms emerge. Each society faced a technological inflection point and responded by mustering political will and state capacity to reorganize the economy . They coordinated resources (capital, labor , knowledge) on a national scale, often through new government institutions or emergency powers, and they actively guided the direction of technological development (rather than leaving it entirely to chance or market forces). War (or the threat thereof) has been a frequent catalyst, but the post-WWII and late 20th-century examples show that a compelling national vision or crisis narrative can also drive mobilization without armed conflict – be it “rebuilding the nation,” “winning the Cold War ,” or “economic survival and competitiveness.” Policy Insights for Mobilizing the Next Technological Shift (AI & Robotics) As we stand on the cusp of a new technological substrate shift – the age of artificial intelligence and robotics – the historical record offers valuable lessons for how an advanced society like the U.S. might deliberately and non-violently mobilize for this transition. Past industrial revolutions and technology- driven shifts were not automatic; they were managed (well or poorly) through policy choices, institutions, and collective efforts . Here are some actionable insights drawn from the precedents above: Define a National Mission or “Moonshot”: Major successes came when nations rallied around a clear mission – whether Japan’s “rich country, strong army” modernization, America’s “Arsenal of Democracy” in WWII, or the Apollo Program. For the AI/robotics revolution, framing it as a national6970 7172 • 7 mission (e.g. “Leadership in AI for broad prosperity” or a specific goal like “moonshot to cure diseases with AI” ) can focus public and political will. This mission orientation helps justify large investments and swift policy changes. The Apollo example showed that a “moonshot” approach to innovation yields broad economic benefits – high-tech R&D tends to have outsized spillover impacts . A mission also improves coordination: stakeholders in government, industry, and academia know what overarching goal to align their efforts to. Strong Public–Private Coordination: Every case above leveraged some form of partnership between the state and private enterprise – neither can do it alone. In WWII and Korea’s take-off, governments provided blueprints, financing, or orders, and companies delivered the goods . For AI and robotics, public-private partnerships are crucial : government can fund fundamental research (as DARPA did for the internet), act as a lead customer for new AI/robotics solutions (creating early markets, as NASA did for microelectronics), and share risks with the private sector . Meanwhile, private firms contribute innovation, speed, and scaling capability. Clear contracts, prize incentives, or consortium models (as seen in semiconductor research alliances) can bring tech companies, universities, and government labs together on specific sub-missions (e.g. developing safe autonomous vehicles or advanced manufacturing robots). History shows that when government and industry move in lockstep towards a common objective, technological progress accelerates dramatically . Mission-Oriented Industrial Policy: Rather than a blanket free-market approach, the next tech shift likely requires strategic industrial policy – targeted support for key technologies and infrastructure. In past examples, this meant tariffs or subsidies for young industries (Germany protecting steel, Japan steering credit to electronics, the U.S. defense department funding early computer chips). Today’s equivalent might include large-scale public investment in AI and robotics infrastructure (e.g. national AI supercomputing centers, 5G/6G networks, or robotics testing facilities), tax incentives for automation startups , or procurement preferences for domestically developed AI tools to foster a robust homegrown industry . It also means identifying bottleneck technologies (semiconductors, battery storage for robots, specialized sensors) and ensuring via policy that the nation leads in or has secure supply of these – akin to how 19th-century states prioritized railroads and steel. Effective industrial policy requires a capable bureaucracy (like Japan’s MITI or France’s postwar planning commission) that can collaborate with businesses and adjust strategies pragmatically. State Capacity and Institutional Innovation: Mobilization is impossible without competent institutions. The historical mobilizations often involved creating new government bodies or legal frameworks – the U.S. War Production Board in WWII, the Ministry of Munitions in WWI Britain, or NASA and DARPA in the Cold War . For the AI era, building state capacity might entail establishing a dedicated national AI agency or task force with authority to coordinate across departments (much as the Space Race led to NASA). It also means upgrading existing institutions with technical expertise – for instance, training regulators and policymakers in AI, so they can craft informed standards and safety protocols. Another aspect of state capacity is strategic foresight and planning : just as mid-20th-century governments adopted multi-year economic plans, a modern government could produce a comprehensive “AI & Automation Transition Strategy” that anticipates workforce impacts, guides investments, and sets milestones (e.g. specific goals for AI in healthcare, transportation, defense, etc.). The ability to plan, execute, and adapt at scale is a hallmark of successful73 • 6774 • • 8 mobilizations – and it hinges on empowering public institutions with talent and resources, rather than leaving everything to fragmented market decisions. Invest in Human Capital: Education and Training at Scale: Every technological revolution disrupts labor markets; societies that managed it best invested heavily in educating and reskilling their people. For example, Meiji Japan’s compulsory education and emphasis on technical training were vital to absorption of new tech . Post-WWII America expanded college access massively via the G.I. Bill, yielding a more skilled workforce for the new high-tech economy . Going forward, a nationwide upskilling mobilization is needed to prepare workers for the AI/robotics age. This could include STEM education reforms (adding AI and coding curriculum in schools, much as science education was bolstered after Sputnik), free or subsidized vocational training and apprenticeships in automation-related fields (echoing Germany’s vocational system or South Korea’s technical high schools), and incentives for lifelong learning (tax credits for worker training, portable “learning accounts”, etc.). The goal is to equip the workforce to complement and manage intelligent machines, not be displaced by them. Given the potential scale of AI disruption, policymakers might consider something as bold as a “GI Bill for the AI Era” – scholarships or stipends enabling millions of adults to return to school or training programs focused on digital and technical skills. Historically, these education investments have high payoff: they increase productivity, ease job transitions, and ensure the benefits of new technology (higher wages, better jobs) are widely shared rather than concentrated. Infrastructure for the New Economy: Technological revolutions often require new infrastructure – railways for steam power , electric grids for electrification, broadband for the digital age. For AI and robotics, critical infrastructure might include universal high-speed internet , modernized electrical grids (to handle data centers and robot power needs), sensor networks (IoT) , and maybe specialized facilities like testing grounds for autonomous vehicles and drones . Just as the U.S. government led the building of the interstate highway system in the 1950s (facilitating commerce in the automobile age), a concerted public works program might be needed now to build the “highways” of the AI age (for example, a national cloud computing infrastructure accessible to innovators, or public datasets and compute resources made available for AI development). Building infrastructure is a classic and effective mobilization tool – it creates jobs in the short term and raises productivity in the long term, smoothing the path for private sector innovation on top of the public platforms. Social Welfare and Inclusion Mechanisms: A recurring theme is that technological disruption without social support leads to instability (e.g. the unrest of displaced workers in 19th-century Britain or 1930s America). Successful mobilizations often included measures to ease the social pains of transformation – Bismarck’s insurance schemes, FDR’s Social Security and labor protections, etc. For the AI revolution, policies to mitigate inequality and displacement will be essential for maintaining public support. Consider instituting or strengthening unemployment insurance, job transition assistance, and portable benefits for gig/contract workers who often power the digital economy. Some economists advocate more radical ideas like a universal basic income or federal job guarantee as buffers during the automation wave. Even if not that far-reaching, at minimum a robust safety net (healthcare, childcare, housing support) gives workers the security to retrain and move to new opportunities. Furthermore, ensuring that the gains from AI (which can greatly increase productivity) are broadly shared via higher wages, profit-sharing, or tax-and-dividend schemes will prevent the underconsumption trap of the 1920s where productivity gains fueled inequality . In• 40 7576 • • 4 9 short, inclusive prosperity isn’t just fair, it’s necessary for sustained technological adoption – people won’t embrace AI if it only benefits a few and leaves many worse off. Ethical and Regulatory Framework (Proactive Governance): Just as past industrial shifts led to new regulations (antitrust laws in the Gilded Age, labor laws in the Progressive Era, environmental laws in the post-1960s), the AI/robotics era will require updated governance to address its unique challenges (data privacy, algorithmic bias, safety of autonomous systems, etc.). A mission-oriented approach would involve government, industry, and civil society working together to set standards and “rules of the road” for AI , much as standards for rail gauges or communication protocols had to be set in earlier times. Clear rules can actually foster innovation by reducing uncertainty and preventing backlash. For example, establishing a rigorous approval process for self- driving cars and robots (like the FDA model for drugs) could both protect the public and legitimize the new tech. Allocating funding for research on AI safety and ethics (akin to how nuclear regulation and safety research accompanied the nuclear tech rollout) is another piece of the mobilization puzzle – ensuring the technological revolution is not only economically successful but also aligned with societal values. This “soft infrastructure” of laws and norms is as critical as physical infrastructure in the long run. Finally, a meta-insight: the power of narrative and leadership . In every historical case, visionary leadership and compelling narratives galvanized the masses to participate in the effort. Whether it was Meiji leaders invoking national pride and survival, FDR’s fireside chats giving people hope in shared action, or Kennedy’s famous “We choose to go to the moon” speech, the ability to articulate why society must mobilize and inspire cooperation is vital. For the AI revolution, leaders will need to communicate that this is an opportunity to create widespread prosperity – a new era where intelligent machines can liberate humans from drudgery – but only if we actively shape it . The narrative should avoid dystopia and focus on mission : e.g., “Let’s use AI and robots to solve the grand challenges – from curing diseases to reviving manufacturing and tackling climate change – much like past generations used industrial might to win wars or explore space.” History shows that people are willing to embrace disruption if they believe in the purpose and see a role for themselves in it . In conclusion, mobilizing for the AI and robotics age will entail treating this transformation with the urgency and coordination of a wartime economy – but without the war . It means marshaling our democratic institutions, our innovative companies, and our workforce around a shared project: updating the economic structure for the coming century. The precedent is there. As one WWII economic historian noted, the lesson of that era is that “if American policymakers had applied the lessons of World War II mobilization to the toughest challenges of the later twentieth century, people around the world would be better off today.” The next technological revolution presents a chance to finally apply those lessons in peacetime. By learning from Meiji Japan, wartime America, postwar Europe, and others, we can devise a mission-oriented strategy that harnesses AI and robotics to serve society, just as prior generations harnessed steam, electricity, and silicon – deliberately, collaboratively, and with bold vision . Key Policy Precedents for an AI/Robotics Mobilization: Mission Focus: Establish ambitious national goals (a “moonshot mentality”) to direct AI and robotics innovation toward public good, much as the Apollo program and WWII mobilization provided unifying targets . • 23 • 73 10 Public Investment in R&D and Infrastructure: Greatly increase federal funding for AI research (basic and applied) and build enabling infrastructure (e.g. testbeds, high-performance computing centers, broadband) akin to past investments in railroads, highways, and the power grid. Industrial Policy and Incentives: Implement targeted policies to grow domestic AI/robotics industries – for example, incentives for local production of robotics hardware (similar to mid-20th century manufacturing policies), and government procurement of AI solutions to stimulate markets (echoing how military contracts spurred early computing) . Education and Workforce Development: Launch large-scale training programs (university scholarships, coding bootcamps, trade school expansions) to prepare workers for AI-era jobs, drawing on models like the G.I. Bill and Germany’s apprenticeship system. Emphasize STEM, but also retraining for mid-career workers (e.g. manufacturing workers displaced by automation) to transition into new roles. Social Safety Nets during Transition: Strengthen unemployment benefits, healthcare, and perhaps introduce new measures (wage insurance, universal basic income pilots, or public employment options) to support those displaced by automation, ensuring social stability and maintaining consumer demand (preventing a repeat of the 1930s underconsumption) . Public–Private Coordination Bodies: Create joint task forces or councils that bring together government officials, industry leaders, and technical experts to coordinate the rollout of AI – similar to wartime production boards or Japan’s MITI committees – so that efforts are not duplicated and standards are agreed upon. Ethical and Regulatory Framework: Proactively develop regulations and standards for AI and robotics (on safety, transparency, accountability) in consultation with stakeholders, to prevent harms and build public trust. A regulatory approach that is adaptive (like a “sandbox” for testing autonomous systems under oversight) can both protect society and allow innovation, much as early automobile regulations and safety standards eventually facilitated the car industry’s growth. Global Cooperation and Competition: Recognize that mobilizing for AI is also a geopolitical endeavor – past technological shifts saw nations jostling for leadership (Britain vs continental powers, USA vs USSR). Engage in international collaboration on norms (to avoid races to the bottom on AI safety or misuse), while also investing domestically to stay at the forefront. Historical analogies include the cooperative framework of the postwar era (Bretton Woods, etc.) combined with healthy competition (the Space Race spurred innovation). By integrating these policy measures into a coherent strategy, the U.S. (or any advanced society) can aim to replicate the success of past mobilizations – achieving a smooth transition to a new techno-economic paradigm with broadly shared benefits . The past two centuries of history make one thing clear: technological revolutions are not merely about inventors in labs – they are about societies deciding to embrace the future and organizing themselves to make it happen . With foresight and resolve, we can do the same for the AI revolution, forging a prosperous new era without the calamity of war to push us there. Sources: Stiglitz, Joseph E. and Bruce Greenwald.
