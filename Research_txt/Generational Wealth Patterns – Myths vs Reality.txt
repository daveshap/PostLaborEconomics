Generational Wealth Patterns – Myths vs Reality Introduction: Conventional wisdom and popular media often paint Millennials as a financially “doomed” generation – burdened by student debt, priced out of homeownership, and destined to be worse off than their parents. Viral memes and headlines claim that Millennials are “the unluckiest generation in U.S. history” or even “screwed,” facing “the scariest financial future of any generation since the Great Depression” . Yet, a rigorous look at the empirical data reveals a more nuanced – and in many ways more optimistic – reality. Drawing on primary sources like the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) and Distributional Financial Accounts (DFA) , as well as peer-reviewed economic research, this report examines generational wealth patterns to dispel popular myths and clarify the realities. We analyze household income and net worth across Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials with proper age adjustments; investigate the concentration of wealth in Boomer hands versus per-household figures; assess inheritance trends and the timing of wealth transfers; evaluate Boomers’ spending and dissaving behavior in retirement; explore psychological and cultural factors shaping perceptions; and discuss how asset markets, housing supply, and policy design have created today’s generational wealth landscape. The tone throughout is rigorous and data-driven – prioritizing facts over anecdotes – with the goal of illuminating where generational economics defy common myths. Tables, charts, and citations to authoritative sources are provided to ground each point in evidence. In the end, the surprising conclusion emerges that Millennials are not a lost economic generation at all – by some measures they have caught up with or even surpassed prior cohorts – even as structural forces and perception gaps continue to fuel intergenerational misunderstandings. 1. Income and Net Worth across Generations (Age-Adjusted) A fundamental pitfall in comparing generations is the age difference : older households naturally have had more years to accumulate savings and assets. To meaningfully compare Baby Boomers, Gen X, and Millennials, we must correct for age and examine finances at similar life stages. When we do so, a surprising finding emerges: Millennials are now modestly ahead of where earlier generations were at the same age, in terms of median net worth. This contradicts the prevailing narrative of Millennial economic stagnation. Below we detail comparative income and wealth metrics by generation, adjusted to equivalent ages and inflation. Median Household Net Worth at Similar Ages: The Federal Reserve’s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) provides a basis for comparing generational wealth at similar points in the life cycle. In particular , we can look at households around age 40 (late 30s to early 40s) in different survey years, each corresponding largely to a different generation: - In the 1989 SCF , when the cohort aged 35–44 was composed mainly of Baby Boomers (born 1945–54), the median household net worth for that age group was approximately $130,000 (in 2022 dollars) . - In the 2007 SCF , when the 35–44 age group was predominantly Gen X (born 1963–72), the median net worth was about $126,000 (2022 dollars) . - In the 2022 SCF , the 35–44 cohort (largely older Millennials, born 1978–87) had a median net worth of roughly $135,000 . 12 3 3 3 1 These figures – summarized in Table 1 – show that at roughly age 40, the typical Millennial household is slightly wealthier than the typical Gen X or Boomer household was at the same age. In inflation-adjusted terms, Millennials’ median net worth in their late 30s/early 40s is a few percentage points higher than that of Gen X at the same age (and modestly higher than Boomers’ as well) . This finding directly refutes the myth that Millennials have less wealth than prior generations did at mid-life; on the contrary, they appear to be modestly ahead in median net worth by age ~40. <table> <caption><strong>Table 1.</strong> Median Household Net Worth at ~Age 40 (Inflation-adjusted to 2022 USD)</caption> <thead> <tr><th>Survey Year (Age ~35–44)</th><th>Dominant Generation in Cohort</ th><th>Median Net Worth </th></tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr><td>1989</td><td>Baby Boomers</ td><td>$130,000</td></tr> <tr><td>2007</td><td>Generation X</td><td>$126,000</td></tr> <tr><td>2022</td><td>Millennials</td><td>$135,000</td></tr> </tbody> </table> Sources: Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances (1989, 2007, 2022) . (Median net worth of households with reference person aged 35–44, in 2022 dollars.) Notably, these median wealth figures for ~40-year-olds are very close across cohorts – on the order of \ $125–135K – indicating broad similarity. Millennials have just edged into the lead, but not by a dramatic margin (roughly 7% above Gen X’s 2007 level, and 4% above Boomers’ 1989 level) . What is dramatic is the change from a decade ago: in the aftermath of the Great Recession, Gen Xers of that era (then in their 30s) had seen their median wealth plunge far below prior norms (in 2010, median wealth for age 35–44 fell to only ~$58K after the housing crash) . Millennials essentially spent their early adulthoods recovering lost ground. By 2019 they were still slightly behind where Boomers and Gen X had been, but the latest data show a full catch-up and surpassing of earlier cohorts’ median wealth at the same age . In fact, research by the St. Louis Fed finds that older Millennials’ wealth in 2022 was about 37% higher than would have been predicted based on previous generations’ trajectories – a remarkable swing from 2016, when they were nearly 40% below the expected path . In short, Millennials are no longer a “lost wealth” generation; by their late 30s, they have closed the gap and slightly exceeded the wealth benchmarks set by Boomers and Gen X at the same age. Household Income Trajectories: A similar story emerges on the income side. By matching age groups across time, we see that Millennials’ earnings are comparable to or higher than those of earlier cohorts in young adulthood (when adjusted for inflation). For example, median cumulative income earned by Millennials in their 20s and early 30s slightly outpaced that of prior generations: one study found that Millennials born in 1989 earned a median of $446,570 between ages 25–34, compared to ~$418K (in 2023 dollars) for Gen X and ~$362K for Boomers over the same ages . Furthermore, by their prime working years (mid-30s), Millennials have the highest educational attainment of any generation (over 40% hold college degrees vs ~25% of Boomers at that age) , which bodes well for lifetime earnings potential. To be sure, median household income growth has been slow in recent years (even declining ~5% from 2019–2022 after inflation) , but that headwind affected all generations. The key point is that there is no evidence of Millennials earning significantly less than Gen X or Boomers did at the same life stage – if anything, their inflation-adjusted incomes are slightly higher on average . This aligns with the net worth data: Millennials’ capacity to build wealth has not been structurally lower than that of prior cohorts when age- adjusted; indeed higher education rates and a strong labor market (pre-2020 and in the 2021–2022 rebound) have given many Millennials income levels that compare favorably to earlier generations’ at the same age.3 3 3 3 4 56 76 8 9 10 8 2 Wealth Distribution within Cohorts: It is important to note that while medians tell the story for the “typical” household, wealth is very unevenly distributed. Averages are much higher than medians due to top-heavy wealth concentration. For instance, across all ages the mean U.S. household net worth (~$1.06 million) is over 5 times the median (~$193,000) , because the top 10% holds ~67% of all wealth . Among younger generations, inequality is also considerable – a few ultra-wealthy Millennials boost the average. One analysis pointed out that the “relatively decent” financial state of Millennials as a whole is buoyed by a few that are wildly wealthy while the majority still struggle . Indeed, Federal Reserve data show that roughly 12% of U.S. families had a net worth over $1 million in 2022 , and many of those millionaire families are Boomers or older Gen X. Millennials have fewer years of compounding behind them, so their wealth distribution is naturally more skewed toward the lower end (a larger share have near-zero or negative net worth in their 20s/30s). Even so, by their early 40s many Millennials have entered the middle class or affluent brackets, aided by rising asset values. In 2022, over 99% of Millennial households had some assets (savings, investments, etc.), actually a slightly higher proportion than Gen X or Boomers had at similar ages , although Millennials also were slightly more likely to carry debt (88% had debt) – consistent with higher student loan prevalence. We will discuss later the distributional nuance (e.g. wealth inequality within generations), but the key takeaway here is that generation-wide medians show Millennials are not falling behind their predecessors . By correcting for age and inflation, we find myth-busting evidence that the typical Millennial household is at least on par , if not modestly ahead, in net worth relative to prior generations at the same point in life . Lifetime Wealth Trajectories: Of course, each generation’s story is still unfolding. Baby Boomers (born 1946–64) are now mostly in their late 50s to 70s, at or nearing the peak of their wealth accumulation (historically, net worth tends to peak around retirement age and then plateau or decline). Gen X (born 1965– 80) are in their 40s and 50s, entering their prime earning years and catching up fast. Millennials (born 1981– 96) are in their late 20s to early 40s, with decades of careers ahead. A crucial nuance is that Millennials’ wealth trajectory was initially delayed by economic crises (the Great Recession hit as many were graduating or early-career , then a once-in-a-century pandemic in their 30s), but they have shown remarkable resilience. After lagging in the 2010s, Millennials’ net worth growth accelerated in the late 2010s and early 2020s. Booming stock and housing markets (discussed later) lifted many Millennial households that had entered those markets. As a result, by 2022 younger cohorts’ wealth had not only recovered but overshot expectations . Figure 1 illustrates this turnaround: whereas older Millennials’ median wealth was ~30–40% below the historical trendline in 2010–2016, by 2022 it was ~37% above the long-run cohort benchmark . In essence, Millennials made up for lost time. This suggests that dire forecasts of a permanently scarred generation were premature. If current trends hold, Millennials could accumulate comparable lifetime wealth to Boomers, albeit via a different, more volatile path. Household Formation and Income Adjustments: It’s also worth considering demographic differences – for example, Millennials tend to marry and buy homes later than previous generations did, which can delay the pooling of incomes or equity gains associated with those milestones. When evaluating household income and wealth, the timing of marriage and homeownership matters. Some of Millennials’ relative strength in median wealth by age 40 may reflect that those who have formed households by that age are a somewhat self-selected group (with some lower-wealth individuals remaining single or renting). However , data show Millennial homeownership rates have been catching up as they enter their late 30s – despite headwinds, by 2022 around 48% of older Millennials (ages 30–39) owned homes, not drastically different from prior generations after controlling for age and economic cycle . Additionally, the labor force participation of women (which increased markedly from Boomer to Gen X to Millennial cohorts) means dual-income households are more common for Millennials, boosting their household incomes. In short,1112 13 14 15 16 16 3 76 56 17 3 social changes and delays in life milestones complicate direct comparisons, but the corrected data indicates that by mid-life, Millennials as a group have largely reached the same economic milestones (in terms of wealth and earnings) as earlier generations – and even by some metrics, surpassed them. Summary: When we strip away the distortions of age and inflation, the “woe is me” Millennial narrative loses much of its validity. The median Millennial entering their 40s is slightly better off financially than the median Gen Xer or Boomer was at that age . Far from being uniquely deprived, Millennials have benefited from economic recovery and asset appreciation in recent years, bringing them back in line with historical norms. This is not to say every Millennial is thriving – within each generation there are winners and losers, and many young adults still struggle with student debt or high living costs. But at the broad cohort level, the data do not support the notion of Millennials as a poorer generation than their predecessors . The myth of irreversible generational decline (at least in terms of net worth by age) is countered by the empirical reality: adjusted for age, Millennials have approximately matched or modestly exceeded the wealth benchmarks set by prior generations. 2. Boomers’ Wealth Dominance vs Per-Household Reality Another stark headline in the generational wealth story is the immense aggregate wealth controlled by Baby Boomers . Boomers as a cohort hold an outsized share of the nation’s riches – well over half of all U.S. household wealth by recent estimates – which often fuels commentary about Boomers “hoarding” wealth or younger generations being shut out. However , looking only at total wealth by generation can be misleading. Boomers’ dominance owes much to their large population size and life-cycle stage (they are older and at peak wealth), and it does not mean every Boomer is wealthy. In fact, on a per-household basis, Boomers are only modestly wealthier on average than Gen X (and within each generation wealth is highly unequal). This section examines the concentration of wealth in Boomer hands and contrasts aggregate figures with per- household and median figures to put the numbers in perspective. Aggregate Wealth Shares: Baby Boomers (born 1946–64) today represent roughly 20% of the U.S. population but hold about 50% of total household wealth. Federal Reserve data show that Boomers’ share of U.S. wealth peaked at 53% in 2021 and has since dipped slightly to around 51% as of the end of 2024 . This means over half of all net worth (stocks, homes, businesses, etc., minus debts) in the country is concentrated with the Boomer generation. In dollar terms, American Boomers collectively held about $82 trillion in net worth by early 2025 . This is more than double the total wealth of Gen X (who held about $42 trillion) and roughly four times the wealth of Millennials (around $16 trillion) at the same point . No prior cohort in U.S. history has commanded such a large slice of the economic pie – indeed, it is noted that “no single cohort anywhere, at any time, commanded so large a slice of the pie” as Boomers now do . For context, the Silent Generation (born 1928–45, now mostly in their 80s and 90s) holds roughly $20 trillion (about 13% of wealth) , and Generation Z (born after 1996) is only just beginning to accumulate wealth (their share is still very small). Thus, the wealth pyramid is currently very top-heavy with Boomers. It’s important to stress that this Boomer wealth concentration is partly a function of demographics and life-cycle . Boomers were a large generation (~72 million strong at peak), and they are now in late adulthood when net worth tends to be highest. Wealth generally increases with age (up to a point) as people pay off mortgages, accumulate investments, and inherit assets. So one reason Boomers hold so much wealth is simply that they are mostly in their 60s and 70s – the stage when people’s net worth is typically at its maximum. Earlier in their lives, Boomers did not always dominate: for example, back in 1989, when the3 18 18 19 19 20 21 4 oldest Boomers were early 40s and youngest were mid-20s, Boomers held only about 20% of U.S. wealth . As they aged and asset values grew over subsequent decades, their share steadily climbed . It topped 50% during the 2010s when Boomers were transitioning into retirement en masse . Now, as Boomers begin drawing down assets or transferring them, we may see their share gradually recede – but slowly (more on that in Section 4). Per-Household Wealth Averages: While Boomers in aggregate have around twice the wealth of Gen X, it does not follow that the average Boomer household is twice as rich as the average Gen X household. In fact, the gap in per-household wealth is much smaller . According to Federal Reserve DFA data compiled by USAFacts, the average (mean) net worth per household in each generation is approximately : Baby Boomers: ~$1.6 million average net worth per household (the highest of any generation) . Silent Generation: ~$1.29 million per household on average (second-highest, as many Silents are in their 80s and have spent down some savings) . Generation X: ~$1.11 million average per household . Millennials: Lowest average net worth – not explicitly stated in the source, but substantially below Gen X (likely on the order of a few hundred thousand dollars per household on average, given their ~$16T total wealth spread over tens of millions of households). For instance, if Millennials’ total wealth is $16T and if we estimate around 40–50 million Millennial households, their average might be roughly $300k–$400k per household (a rough order-of-magnitude). This aligns with Millennials being younger and earlier in wealth accumulation (and the fact that their median is ~$135k at age ~40, as seen above). These averages confirm that Boomer households are wealthier on average, but not astronomically so relative to Gen X . An average Boomer household (~$1.6M) has about 45% more wealth than an average Gen X household (~$1.1M) – a significant difference, but far less dramatic than the “Boomers have 2x the wealth of Gen X” figure one gets from total dollars (since there are also more Boomer households). Likewise, the average Millennial household’s net worth is still only a fraction of the Boomers’, but that largely reflects age/life stage – younger households haven’t had as long to accumulate. It’s also worth noting that “average” can be skewed by the top end; many Boomer households are millionaires due to home equity and retirement accounts, but many others have far less. Median Wealth by Generation: A more representative statistic is the median net worth within each generation. Because Boomers are older , their median is expectedly higher than that of younger cohorts – but this is a life-cycle effect, not a mystery. As of the 2022 SCF, median net worth by age bracket was : - Age 65–74 (mostly Boomers): median ~$410,000. - Age 55–64 (younger Boomers plus oldest Gen X): median ~$364,000. - Age 45–54 (mostly Gen X): median ~$246,700. - Age 35–44 (older Millennials & younger Gen X): median ~$135,300. - Age 25–34 (mostly Millennials): median ~$39,000. From these figures, a reasonable median Boomer household net worth (Boomers spanning late 50s to late 70s) might be on the order of $300–400K . The median Gen X household (now late 40s/50s) might be around $200–250K , and the median Millennial (late 20s/30s) around $50–140K depending on age subgroup . Thus, while Boomers lead in median wealth as well, the differences are not extreme in a life-cycle context – one would expect those in their 60s to have several times the net worth of those in their 30s simply due to decades of savings and compounding. 22 23 18 2425 • 26 • 27 • 27 • 27 28 29 2928 5 The extreme concentration suggested by aggregate numbers is therefore a bit misleading when interpreted as “every Boomer is rich.” In reality, wealth inequality within the Boomer generation is very high – a subset of Boomers (often those with higher education, higher incomes, or business ownership) account for a large share of that $82 trillion. Many other Boomer households have modest savings. In fact, a 2022 analysis found that about two-thirds of Boomers nearing retirement were not financially prepared by standard metrics (many have under $100k in retirement assets aside from Social Security) . The Boomer cohort spans a wide socioeconomic spectrum. The same is true for Gen X and Millennials: wealth is very unequally distributed in each generation. It just happens that Boomers have more of the high-wealth individuals, partly because they had more time to accumulate and ride asset booms. Why Do Boomers Hold So Much Wealth? Several structural advantages and historical tailwinds benefited the Boomer generation’s wealth accumulation, distinguishing their experience from that of later generations: Affordable Asset Prices in Youth: Boomers came of age in an era of relatively cheap real estate and equities. For example, the median U.S. home price in 1970 was only $23,600 – about $200,000 in today’s dollars – less than half of the current median (~$420,000) . This meant many Boomers were able to buy homes in the 1970s and 1980s at prices that, even adjusting for inflation, were far more affordable relative to income than today’s housing. Those homes have since appreciated enormously, delivering windfall gains to owners. Similarly, stock markets were much lower; a Boomer investing $1,000 in the S&P 500 in 1975 (the start of their careers) would see it grow to over $30,000 (inflation-adjusted) by 2025 , thanks to decades of strong market returns averaging ~10% annually . Later generations had to buy into assets that were already expensive (e.g., Millennials in the 2010s faced home prices that had outpaced wage growth for years), and though they too benefit from recent asset inflation, the absolute entry prices were higher . Thus, Boomers enjoyed tailwinds of rising asset prices from a low base. Generous Pension and Benefit Structures: A large portion of Boomers, especially older Boomers, have been covered by defined-benefit pensions and robust employer benefits that are far rarer today. Over half of late-career Boomers still qualify for a defined-benefit pension , whereas fewer than 15% of workers under 40 have any pension coverage of that kind . These pensions (common in mid/late 20th century) provided guaranteed income in retirement and reduced the need to draw down personal savings, allowing many Boomers to preserve or even grow their wealth after retirement. In contrast, Gen X and Millennials rely mostly on defined-contribution plans (401(k), IRA) for retirement – which require individuals to accumulate their own balances and bear investment risk. Additionally, Boomers have benefited from programs like Social Security and Medicare for a substantial portion of their retirement, ensuring they don’t have to deplete personal wealth as quickly for living or medical expenses. (Younger generations hope those programs will still be as supportive when they retire, but there is uncertainty.) In short, policy design in the mid-20th century favored stable wealth for seniors , and Boomers are the last generation to fully experience that era of pensions and broad-based benefit growth . Demographic Size and Economic Growth: Boomers are a huge cohort (76 million births during 1946–64). Their sheer numbers mean that in aggregate they would hold a lot of wealth even if individual wealth levels were typical. For example, if each Boomer household averaged the same net worth as Gen X, Boomers would still have more total wealth simply because there are more Boomer households. Additionally, Boomers spent most of their working lives in the expansive decades of the3031 • 32 33 33 • 34 34 • 6 late 20th century when U.S. GDP was growing robustly. They had opportunities to accumulate assets during long economic booms (the 1980s, 1990s) and benefited from low inflation and falling interest rates after the 1980s. By virtue of timing, Boomers were able to buy low and later sell high – whether it be houses, stocks, or other investments – on a scale that previous generations (hit by Depression/ war) or later ones (facing high starting asset prices) did not. These factors help explain why Boomers today appear so dominant in wealth. Importantly, none of these are about Boomers “stealing” wealth from younger people – rather , they reflect historical timing and policy contexts. Rising asset prices create a bigger pie, and Boomers happened to have a large slice already when the pie expanded. Per-Household vs Aggregate – A Reality Check: What does all this mean for the myth/reality dynamic? It means that while it’s true Boomers hold an outsized portion of wealth in aggregate, this doesn’t translate to every Boomer being wealthy or every Millennial being poor. Many Boomer households are comfortable, but not extraordinarily rich; likewise, many younger households are building wealth steadily. For example, consider that median Boomers (hundreds of thousands in net worth) versus median Millennials (tens or low hundreds of thousands in net worth) – that gap can largely be explained by age (the Millennials will likely reach similar medians when they are 60+). Moreover , if one looks at per capita or per household wealth, the contrast is less stark than the total $81T vs $16T might imply. To illustrate, Table 2 contrasts Boomers, Gen X, and Millennials on total vs per-household wealth metrics: <table> <caption><strong>Table 2.</strong> Generational Wealth Metrics (Approximate, as of ~2024)</ caption> <thead> <tr><th>Generation</th><th>Share of U.S. Household Wealth </th><th>Total Net Worth (trillions) </th><th>Average Net Worth per Household </th><th>Median Net Worth (by age bracket) </th></tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr><td>Baby Boomers (1946–64)</td><td>~51%</ td><td>$82 trillion</td><td>$1.6 million</td><td>$364K (55–64 age), $410K (65–74 age)</td></tr> <tr><td>Generation X (1965–80)</td><td>~26%</td><td>$42 trillion</td><td>$1.1 million</td><td>$247K (45–54 age)</td></tr> <tr><td>Millennials (1981–96)</td><td>~9%</td><td>$16 trillion</td><td>~$0.3– 0.4 million (est.)</td><td>$135K (35–44 age), $39K (25–34 age)</td></tr> </tbody> </table> Sources: Federal Reserve DFA and SCF (2022–2025) . Silent Gen not shown above holds ~13% (~$20T) with avg ~$1.3M . Median figures by age group from SCF 2022. From Table 2, one can see that although Boomers collectively have ~5× the wealth of Millennials, the typical (median) Boomer has on the order of 3× the net worth of the typical Millennial – an expected difference given the 30-year age gap. The average Boomer household’s wealth is only ~4× the average Millennial’s, not 5×, indicating that part of Boomers’ aggregate heft is due to having more households or more high-wealth outliers. In short, Boomers’ aggregate wealth dominance is real, but on an individual household basis the gap is less extreme than headlines suggest. Concentration at the Top: Another reality often lost in generational debates is that most of the wealth – even among Boomers – is concentrated in a relatively small fraction of households. For example, a wealthy Boomer billionaire’s fortune skews the totals far more than millions of middle-class Boomers combined. The top 1% of all U.S. households (across ages) hold about a third of all wealth , and many of those are older . So, some of the “Boomer wealth” story is really an “ultra-rich wealth” story. Meanwhile, the median Boomer relies heavily on Social Security and home equity for retirement, similar to prior generations. This nuance is1835 19 2627 2928 1819262728 27 36 7 important: younger generations might not actually want to “swap places” with the median Boomer when that median person may have just a few hundred thousand in assets and looming retirement expenses. The myth sometimes implied is that all Boomers are sitting on huge piles of cash; the reality is that many are financially fragile or just moderately well-off, and the aggregate trillions are skewed by the top tier . Boomers vs. Per-Household Reality – Summary: Baby Boomers unquestionably command a disproportionate share of U.S. wealth at the macro level – a fact that can fuel intergenerational resentment and policy debates. However , understanding the context is crucial. Boomers’ wealth dominance is partly a natural outcome of lifecycle and historical fortune (asset booms), and on a per-household basis Boomers are “ahead” of younger generations largely because they are older (and had some structural advantages). The data dispel the myth that Boomers as individuals are uniformly rich or that Millennials are universally paupers. The wealth gap is real but can be overstated if one only cites aggregate totals. For policymakers, this suggests targeting resources or taxes at the truly wealthy (who might be disproportionately Boomer) rather than treating an entire generation as monolithic. For society, it means recognizing that many Boomer retirees are far from secure, even as their generation as a whole holds unprecedented wealth – a seeming paradox explained by internal inequality. The coming sections on inheritance and retirement behavior will further illuminate how this wealth concentration is (or isn’t) being passed on or spent down. 3. Inheritance and Intergenerational Transfers – The Timing Puzzle One oft-cited component of generational wealth is inheritance – the passing of assets from older to younger generations. With Boomers holding such a large share of wealth, a “great wealth transfer” has been anticipated, wherein Millennials and Gen X will inherit trillions in coming decades. However , there are many myths and misconceptions about inheritance. Crucially, the timing of inheritances has shifted later: the average person now receives an inheritance much later in life (in their 50s or even 60s) than was the case a generation ago . This delays the impact of inherited wealth on young adults’ finances. Moreover , not everyone inherits money at all – in fact, a relatively small minority of households receive the bulk of bequests, often those who are already well-off. Here we examine empirical data on inheritance amounts, ages, and trends, and what that means for generational wealth patterns. Later Inheritances: Perhaps the most striking shift is in the age at which people inherit. In 1989, the average heir was around 41 years old at the time of inheritance. Today, that average inheritance age is roughly 51 years . In other words, inheritances have been pushed about a decade later . The reason is straightforward: people are living longer and holding onto their assets until later in life. Many Boomers’ parents (Silent Generation) are living into their 80s and 90s, so Boomers did not inherit until they were themselves in their 50s or 60s. Likewise, Boomers are living longer and may not pass wealth to their Millennial children until those kids are middle-aged. One financial commentator summarized this trend: “the average age of inheritance in 1989 was 41, and now it’s around 51, as people are living longer.” This delay means that inheritance is less of a factor for young adults’ finances today than it might have been in the past. Millennials in their 20s or 30s generally cannot count on receiving any bequest yet (their Boomer parents are mostly still alive and may live for decades more). By the time a typical Millennial receives an inheritance – say in their 50s – it may help their retirement, but it comes too late to assist with early-life needs like buying a first home or raising children. Magnitude and Distribution of Inheritances: How much wealth will actually be transferred? There is talk of a coming “great wealth transfer” on the order of $70–80 trillion over the next 20–30 years from Boomers to heirs . Indeed, Boomers will pass on a vast sum, but it’s important to note this transfer is gradual and37 37 38 8 unequal. Each year , only around ~1% of total U.S. wealth is handed down via estates – there is no sudden flood, rather a steady flow. Moreover , inheritances are heavily skewed toward the affluent. According to Federal Reserve data, among households in the top 1% of wealth, about inheritances average $719,000 when received; by contrast, among the bottom 50% of households, the average inheritance (for the minority who get any) is on the order of $9,700 . In other words, for most people inheritance is not “life-changing” money . A study found even for upper-middle families (those around the 50–90th income percentiles), the average inheritance was only ~$46,000 . The giant multi-million bequests are mostly going to those who already are wealthy (rich families beget rich heirs). So while totals in the tens of trillions sound huge, the typical Millennial should not expect a windfall . Many will receive little or nothing – perhaps a small sum split among siblings, or just non-financial assets (a car , heirlooms). Only a subset will inherit substantial amounts, often later in life. That said, for the society at large, inherited wealth will play a growing role simply because Boomers have so much to eventually pass on. By 2045, Millennials as a whole are projected to hold five times as much wealth as they do today, partly boosted by these transfers . But again, that will be concentrated: Cerulli Associates estimates ~42% of the wealth transfer will go to just the top 1.5% of households – essentially perpetuating wealth inequality. In terms of timing , analysts note that the peak of Boomer-to-Millennial inheritances may not occur until the 2030s and 2040s, when the bulk of Boomers reach their 80s and 90s. By then, many Millennials will themselves be nearing retirement age. Peak Inheritance and “Sandwich” Generation: Data on inheritance by age group show that the largest inheritances accrue to people in their late 50s and early 60s . In fact, the average inheritance received peaks for heirs aged roughly 56–65, at around $180,000 . (This aligns with Boomers inheriting from the remaining World War II generation in their 60s.) By contrast, those inheriting at younger ages typically receive much smaller amounts – under age 40, inheritances might average tens of thousands at most . Figure 2 below illustrates the distribution: the 56–65 age bracket inherits the most on average, with a steep drop-off for younger age brackets. Figure 2. Average Inheritance Amount by Age of Recipient. As of recent data, inheritance peaks when heirs are in their late 50s or early 60s (~$180K on average for ages 56–65), whereas those under 40 inherit relatively little on average . Source: University of Pennsylvania survey via Crews Bank; Maggiulli (2025). This reality upends the idealized image of a 20-something inheriting a big trust fund. Those cases are rare. Instead, the typical pattern is that a person inherits from their parents when they themselves are already past 55, perhaps using the money to shore up their own retirement or to pass on something to their children (who might then be in their 20s or 30s – i.e. wealth skips a generation in effect). The lengthening lifespans mean that many Millennials may not inherit until they are approaching their retirement. Sociologically, this has implications: inheritance will not generally help Millennials overcome early- adulthood financial hurdles (like student debt or first-home purchase); they have had to navigate those on their own. Do Boomers Intend to Leave Inheritances? Interestingly, surveys suggest many Boomers are not particularly focused on leaving bequests. In a recent poll by Northwestern Mutual, about half of Baby Boomers said they did not expect to leave any inheritance to their children . Some explicitly plan to “spend their kids’ inheritance” enjoying retirement, while others assume rising longevity and healthcare costs will eat up their savings. This mindset marks a shift from earlier generations that prioritized leaving a legacy. It could be in part a reaction to having seen their own parents linger in expensive end-of-life care;39 40 41 42 43 44 45 44 46 9 Boomers worry their money might go to medical or long-term care rather than heirs. It also reflects a cultural attitude of “younger generations should earn their own way” . If half of Boomers truly don’t plan to leave anything, this could temper expectations of Millennials – though the reality is, even if unintentional, many will still leave something if they don’t manage to spend it all. Reality of Slow Transfers: Despite talk of trillions changing hands, the annual flow of inheritances is modest relative to total wealth. As noted, only ~1% of household wealth transfers per year via estates . A study by the CFA Institute pointed out that this rate has been fairly steady, meaning the wealth transfer is a slow drip, not a sudden wave . One reason is that while some Boomers start passing away in their 60s, the majority will likely live into their 80s. So the crest of transfers is spread over 20+ years. This gives receiving generations time to prepare, but it also means inheritances are not a quick fix for the wealth gaps of young adults . Many Millennials have voiced frustration that they’re waiting for a “hand-me-down economy” – but practically, they may be near retirement themselves by the time meaningful inheritance arrives (if at all). In the meantime, wealth inequality within their generation can’t be solved by a future inheritance that only a fraction will significantly benefit from. Gifts and Early Transfers: It’s worth noting that not all intergenerational help comes at death. Some parents give money to children or grandchildren while alive – for education, down payments, etc. There is some evidence of increased inter-vivos transfers (gifts) as affluent Boomers try to help their kids earlier . For example, some families use the annual gift tax exclusion (up to ~$17k per parent per child per year without tax) to transfer wealth gradually. Others might pay tuition or help purchase a home. These forms of transfer don’t show up as “inheritance” in estate data but can be significant. Such help is likely one reason Millennial homeownership has ticked up recently despite high prices – family assistance with down payments is common. Still, these benefits accrue mostly to upper-middle and wealthy families; lower- income parents can’t afford large gifts. Thus, early transfers may actually widen intra-generational disparities (those with rich parents get a boost). Policy Design and Inheritance: The U.S. tax system historically has not heavily taxed inheritance except on the very largest estates. Estate tax exemptions are high (~$12 million per individual in 2025), meaning the vast majority of Boomer estates will pass tax-free to heirs. Some economists argue this will further entrench dynastic wealth. There is also the “step-up in basis” rule that allows appreciated assets to be passed on without capital gains tax – another boon to heirs of stock and real estate wealth. These policies effectively subsidize inheritances among the wealthy. On the other hand, proposals to tax inheritances more (or treat them as income for recipients) have met political resistance. The net effect is that policy currently does little to redistribute wealth at death; it largely permits generational wealth preservation. This reality means the children of the rich will likely stay rich, which is more a class issue than a simple generational issue. Inheritance Myths vs Reality: To summarize: - Myth: “Young generations will be saved by a huge wealth transfer from Boomers soon.” Reality: The wealth transfer will happen, but slowly and unevenly . The average Millennial won’t inherit until their 50s or 60s , and many will inherit little or nothing of significance . It’s not a quick solution for their younger-years challenges. - Myth: “All Boomers are leaving big inheritances to their kids.” Reality: Many Boomers may not leave much at all – either by choice (spending down, charitable giving) or by necessity (longer retirements, healthcare costs). About half don’t plan on significant bequests . - Myth: “The coming inheritance will level the playing field.” Reality: Inheritances tend to reinforce inequality – wealthy families pass on the most, lower-income39 39 37 40 46 10 families pass on almost nothing . So the wealth transfer might actually increase relative advantages within the Millennial cohort (some suddenly getting a big bump in middle age, others getting none). The data-driven view of inheritance is sobering: it’s certainly a factor in lifetime wealth (especially for Gen X and Millennials as they age), but it arrives late and mostly benefits those already better off. In economic models, this is consistent with a life-cycle theory where bequests often come as “accidental” (people die with money unspent because of uncertainty about lifespan or expenses). In the next section, we’ll see that many retirees are indeed not rushing to spend their wealth – which is why the inheritance age is so high. 4. Boomer Spending and (Slow) Wealth Drawdown in Retirement A critical piece of the generational wealth dynamic is how Baby Boomers are using their wealth now that they are retiring. Will Boomers rapidly spend down (dissave) their assets, thereby boosting the economy or passing wealth on sooner? Or are they holding onto their savings, resulting in slower transfers and sustained wealth inequality? Empirical evidence indicates that retirees – especially wealthier ones – tend to draw down their wealth very slowly . Many even continue to save well into old age. This phenomenon has been dubbed the “retirement savings puzzle” and has significant implications: it means Boomers are likely to retain much of their wealth deep into retirement, only relinquishing it at the very end of life or through careful, minimal withdrawals. In this section, we examine data on Boomer spending patterns, withdrawal rates from retirement accounts, and the reasons behind slow decumulation of wealth. Slow Decumulation Puzzle: Classical economic theory (the life-cycle hypothesis) suggests that people accumulate savings during their working years and then deplete those savings in retirement to maintain their standard of living. In reality, studies consistently find that retirees do not decumulate as fast as theory predicts. In fact, many retired households decumulate wealth very slowly, and a large fraction die leaving significant assets (bequests) . A recent research article succinctly states: “Retired households, especially those with high lifetime income, decumulate their wealth very slowly, and many die leaving large estates.” . This is exactly what we are seeing with Boomers entering retirement. Despite the expectation that they might spend their 401(k)s and home equity to enjoy life or cover expenses, many are drawing down at a trickle. Evidence from Surveys: The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and other longitudinal surveys show remarkable patterns: - High-income retirees maintain wealth: Households in the top wealth quartile often barely touch their principal in the first decades of retirement. Many couples in the upper-middle and top income brackets actually keep growing their assets in their 60s and 70s . For instance, one study found that intact married couples with substantial assets continued to save into their late 80s on average . They often only start depleting after one spouse dies or very late in life. - Lower-income retirees spend some down, but not all: Those in the bottom wealth quintile do tend to spend down what little they have (they need it for living expenses) . But middle-income retirees only slowly use up savings; they might consume interest/dividends and a small portion of principal, preserving a nest egg for emergencies. - Singles vs Couples: Single retirees without a spouse tend to draw down a bit faster than couples, but even they often hold onto assets longer than expected . Couples have an added motive to save: to protect the surviving spouse (a form of bequest motive to one another) . - Overall, less than half of retirees significantly decumulate. A European study found less than half of retired elderly were drawing down their wealth at all; many were stable or even increasing net worth in early retirement .40 47 48 4950 50 51 5249 5354 5556 11 Boomers Specifically: As Boomers retire in large numbers (every day thousands turn 65), early data indicate they are following a similar pattern – albeit with one twist: Boomers have less guaranteed pension income (as discussed earlier), so one might expect them to need to tap assets more. Research by the Center for Retirement Research (CRR) found that earlier cohorts (those mostly with pensions) drew down their financial assets very slowly, leaving much of their savings untouched throughout old age . Boomers, having more 401(k)-type assets and fewer pensions, might draw somewhat faster . In fact, CRR’s analysis suggests that a typical retiree without a pension might draw down about 25% of their wealth by age 70 (versus much less for those with pensions) . Even at that pace, though, it would take until age 85 for them to deplete their savings – and roughly half of such people will live beyond 85, implying some will still have money leftover . So while Boomers without pensions are expected to decumulate faster than their parents did, the pace is still moderate . A quarter of assets drawn in ~5 years (65 to 70) was the estimate; by 75 or 80 maybe around half drawn . Many Boomers, therefore, will carry substantial wealth well into their 80s if they are financially able, both out of caution and necessity to fund later years. Reasons for Slow Drawdown: Why don’t retirees spend their savings freely? Research points to two primary motives: 1. Precautionary Saving for Uncertain Expenses: Retirees fear running out of money, especially due to unpredictable end-of-life medical or long-term care costs . Healthcare, nursing homes, etc., can be enormously expensive if one has chronic illnesses or needs years of care. Because of this risk, households hold on to assets as a buffer . As a Richmond Fed brief notes, “Research points to two reasons why households are slow to decumulate: (i) the need to prepare for uncertain end-of-life medical expenses and (ii) the desire to bequeath assets to family.” The medical expense risk is significant – even with Medicare, out- of-pocket costs in one’s final years can run into tens or hundreds of thousands. Retirees, unsure if they’ll face these costs, often err on the side of holding onto their savings as insurance. Essentially, they self-insure by not spending principal. 2. Bequest Motive: Many older people want to leave something to their kids or other heirs (or simply leave a financial cushion “just in case”). This desire to bequeath leads to restrained spending. Even those who say they don’t plan to leave an inheritance often end up doing so implicitly by underspending. Studies have confirmed that an explicit bequest motive (wanting to leave money behind) is associated with slower drawdown rates . People derive satisfaction from knowing they can help their children or from maintaining a sense of financial security that might extend beyond their life. Culturally, some feel it’s responsible to not exhaust all resources, in case a surviving spouse or other dependent might need it. These motives interact. A recent economic study noted: “the interaction between these two motives is a crucial determinant of saving behavior for all retirees.” For instance, a couple will save to ensure the surviving spouse is taken care of (bequest to spouse) as well as for potential medical needs . Only very late in life, when one’s health trajectory becomes clearer , might people loosen the purse strings – but often at that point, consumption needs/wants diminish (the so-called “slow-go” years in one’s 80s). Spending Patterns: What do we observe in Boomer spending? On average, older households do spend less as they age. Data from Visa (an analysis of affluent boomers) found that for every $1 increase in financial wealth, Americans over 65 spent only an additional $0.11 – a rather low marginal propensity to consume out of wealth. In other words, even when stock portfolios grew, retirees did not proportionally ramp up spending; they largely kept the wealth increase intact. Furthermore, expenditures tend to decline in real terms after age 75 (as mobility and travel decrease) . Many Boomers in their 60s are in a “go- go” phase – spending on travel, hobbies, etc., at relatively high levels – but by their late 70s they enter a “slow-go” phase where both discretionary spending and even some necessary spending (like transportation)57 5859 60 61 6263 62 62 53 64 6566 12 drop off . This means that a substantial portion of their wealth might never be spent on themselves at all, leaving it to pass on eventually. Even at younger retiree ages, surveys show Boomers are cautious. A 2023 study pointed out two-thirds of “peak” Boomers (mid-60s) hadn’t saved enough for retirement by conventional targets . Those who did save are mindful that increased longevity could require funding a 30-year retirement. Hence, many are not drawing 10% a year or anything rash; they stick to conservative withdrawal rates (oft-cited “4% rule” or even less). Additionally, home equity – a major part of many Boomers’ net worth – is typically not tapped until late (if at all). Few downsize or take reverse mortgages in their 60s; they often stay in their homes, meaning that wealth remains locked in the house until they move to assisted living or pass away. The net effect is that Boomers’ aggregate wealth is eroding only slowly year by year , rather than rapidly dissipating after retirement. Implications for Younger Generations: The slow drawdown of Boomer wealth has two sides. On one hand, it means that Boomers are not creating a drag on the economy via a sudden pullback . Fears that mass Boomer retirement would cause a demand cliff or asset fire sales have not materialized. Markets did not crash from Boomers selling stocks en masse; instead, many hold their portfolios intact. On the other hand, it means Millennials/Gen X waiting on inheritances or hoping for cheaper assets may have to wait longer . If Boomers aren’t selling houses at scale (preferring to age in place) and aren’t liquidating stocks, then asset supply remains constrained and prices high. This can hurt younger buyers and investors (we discuss housing supply in the next section). So the slow Boomer decumulation contributes to a sort of status quo persistence : wealth stays in Boomer hands (or trusts) longer , and the next generation’s ascent into that wealth is delayed. Myths vs Reality – Boomer Retirement Spending: - Myth: “Boomers will spend lavishly in retirement, stimulating the economy (or alternatively, depleting their kids’ inheritance).” Reality: Boomers are mostly conservative spenders in retirement , especially beyond the first decade. Many continue saving or hold wealth for contingencies . Their consumption does not explode; if anything, it gradually declines with age. - Myth: “Older people will quickly downsize and free up housing for younger families.” Reality: Many Boomers are aging in place , not selling their homes until very late. This keeps housing inventory tight (we see record-low housing turnover among seniors). - Myth: “Retirees don’t need that much money; they should spend it or give it away.” Reality: Retirees face significant uncertainty (lifespans, health costs) and thus rationally keep a buffer . Also, psychological comfort in having savings is a factor . Most aren’t being miserly for no reason; they are managing risks. In sum, the evidence shows Boomers are drawing down wealth at a measured, often slow pace**. Rather than a rapid wealth hand-off or spend-down, expect a gradual trickle. Many Boomers will still hold considerable assets into their 80s, meaning the wealth “handover” to the next generation – whether by inheritance or gifts – is a long game. This reality tempers both the fears of a Boomer-driven market collapse and the hopes of an imminent Millennial wealth boom via inheritance. It underscores that generational wealth patterns are deeply influenced by behavioral and lifecycle factors: people don’t act like spreadsheet projections; they value security and legacy, leading to wealth lingering longer in older hands.6764 30 6251 63 13 5. Perceptions of Decline: Psychology, Culture, and Media Narratives Despite the improving statistics for younger generations, a perception of economic decline and generational unfairness remains pervasive among Millennials. Why do so many Millennials feel “behind” or believe they are worse off than their parents, even as data shows modest gains? This disconnect arises from psychological and cultural factors – the stories we tell ourselves, amplified by media and the internet. In this section, we delve into the factors shaping these perceptions: the role of online memes and narratives, the impact of social comparisons (often magnified by social media), the salience of certain economic pain points (like housing costs and inflation), and the broader cultural context that frames Millennials as struggling. By understanding these factors, we can see how myths of generational decline take hold, even when reality is more nuanced. Millennial Pessimism in Surveys: Numerous surveys confirm that Millennials themselves often believe they have it tougher than earlier generations. For example, a GOBankingRates/Sunmark survey in 2022 found 68% of Millennials agree that they face “more difficult financial obstacles” than previous generations . Roughly half of Millennial respondents felt they’ve experienced the worst economic environment of any generation – yes, even worse than what the Great Depression or stagflation-era Silent/Greatest generations faced (many Millennials, lacking direct historical experience, perceive the Great Recession and 2020 pandemic as epochal disasters, which for them they were). Similarly, the Deloitte Global Millennial Survey and other polls frequently highlight high levels of financial anxiety and pessimism among Millennials. In one poll, two-thirds of Americans (across ages) believed Millennials are worse off than their parents , indicating this narrative has broad acceptance. This subjective sense persists despite objective gains. For instance, Millennials are more educated and (at least the older ones) have similar or higher incomes than their parents did at the same age, yet a majority say things like “we’ll never be able to afford a house” or “we can’t save for retirement like Boomers did.” Understanding this psychology requires looking at what Millennials visibly experience and compare: Skyrocketing Costs in Key Areas: Millennials have been confronted with certain costs that feel dramatically higher than in the past – notably college tuition, housing in many cities, and healthcare. These are highly salient. If you are a Millennial who paid $50,000/year for college while knowing your Boomer parent’s tuition was a few hundred dollars, you naturally feel disadvantaged. Housing is perhaps the biggest: media constantly report how “home prices have surged X%” or how you need an $80K down payment for an average home today, compared to much less decades ago . Indeed, adjusted for inflation, a 20% down payment on a median home in 2024 is around $86,000, vs about $57,000 in 1990 . These comparisons stick in young people’s minds. Even if mortgage rates were higher then (a mitigating factor), the immediate impression is that houses used to cost $100K and now cost $400K – a massive hurdle. Likewise, rent as a share of income has risen: median rent for a 35-year-old in 2024 is ~$1,481, whereas for a 35-year-old Gen X in 2008 it was equivalent to $1,251 (2024 dollars) . Such cost-of-living pressures create a constant sense of struggle , even if incomes have also grown. Inflation in everyday expenses (like food, fuel, childcare) is very tangible and can eclipse awareness of long-term wealth accumulation through assets. Inflation Salience and Recent Memory: Millennials came of age during a period of relative price stability (the 1990s/2000s had low inflation), so the recent surge of inflation in 2021–2023 – the68 69 70 • 71 71 72 • 14 highest in 40 years, peaking at ~9% – was a shock. Price increases in essentials (rent, groceries) are felt immediately, whereas balance sheet improvements (like a higher 401k or home equity) are abstract and long-term. Behavioral economics tells us that losses and costs feel more salient than gains . So even if a Millennial’s net worth rose from, say, $50k to $100k due to market gains and home appreciation, they may emotionally focus more on the fact that their grocery bill and rent went up, crimping their monthly budget. Inflation also erodes real wages, which Millennials see directly in their paychecks not keeping up. The salience of inflation feeds a narrative that “we can’t get ahead; everything is getting more expensive.” A vivid example: social media was rife with memes about how a slice of pizza or a gallon of milk cost X in 2000 and much more now, fueling the idea that the dollar doesn’t go as far for Millennials. While older folks experienced worse inflation in the 1970s, Millennials didn’t live that, so the current inflation feels unprecedented to them. Internet and Social Media Memetics: Millennials are the first generation to live their entire adult lives in the age of the internet and social media. This hyper-connected information environment has amplified certain memes about generational economics. Think of the proliferation of jokes about Millennials unable to afford homes because they buy “avocado toast” – a meme that ironically started as a criticism of Millennials’ spending but became a rallying cry about out-of-touch advice from Boomers. Similarly, phrases like “OK Boomer” (a dismissive retort highlighting generational rift) and countless Twitter threads lamenting how Boomers got cheap houses, cheap college, stable jobs, and Millennials got debt and the gig economy, have entrenched a collective narrative of grievance. Social media echo chambers can reinforce these beliefs: frustrated young adults share anecdotes of economic hardship, which get thousands of likes and retweets, strengthening the group identity of a struggling generation. Memes distill complex issues into easily shareable content – e.g., charts showing real wages stagnating since 1980 while housing costs soared, or comparisons of starting salaries vs home prices now vs then – often without full context, but compelling in emotional impact. Media Coverage and Confirmation Bias: Traditional media (news outlets, magazines) have extensively covered the theme of Millennials in economic peril. Consider high-profile pieces like The Atlantic ’s "The Cheapest Generation" or Huffington Post’s feature literally titled “Millennials Are Screwed” , which declared Millennials “the scariest financial future… since the Great Depression” . The Washington Post ran an analysis calling Millennials “the unluckiest generation in U.S. history” due to slow growth early in their careers. These narratives, often written during the slow recovery of the early 2010s, have had lasting influence. Once such a narrative takes hold, confirmation bias leads people to notice facts that support it (e.g., high student loan balances, low homeownership in 2015) and discount those that don’t (e.g., rapid Millennial wealth growth after 2016). Media also tends to highlight dramatic comparisons: “Millennials have less wealth, lower homeownership, higher debt than Boomers at same age,” which was true circa 2010 and made for a compelling story. Even as the data changed by the 2020s, the storyline lingers. Importantly, bad news sells – articles about young people’s economic struggles get clicks and shares, whereas a headline like “Actually, Millennials Are Doing Slightly Better Than Gen X Did” is not sexy. So there’s an inherent tilt toward emphasizing problems over progress. Social Comparison and Expectations: Millennials are often called the “social media generation,” and platforms like Facebook, Instagram, etc., create constant windows into peers’ lives. This fuels social comparison – often to an unrealistic standard. If one sees high school friends posting about buying a house or a new car , one might feel behind if one hasn’t achieved that, even if one’s personal finances are solid. Furthermore, Millennials often compare themselves to their parents at the same73 • • 2 1 • 15 age, and to what was common then: e.g., “my parents bought a house and had two kids by 30; I’m 30 and renting with roommates.” This can breed a sense of failure or decline, even if the reasons for delayed milestones are partly choice (marrying later , urban living preferences) or broader societal shifts (later marriage and childbearing are common now). The narrative of “Every generation should do better than the last” is deeply ingrained in the American Dream. When Millennials don’t see obvious outward signs of being “richer” than their parents were at the same age (indeed many see themselves as less able to afford a family or home), they internalize that as decline. It’s an emotional assessment, even if net worth on paper is eventually catching up. Additionally, inequality plays a role: Millennials grew up in an age of extreme wealth visible at the top (billionaire tech founders, influencers with luxury lifestyles). The ultra-rich Millennials or Gen Zers one sees online distort perceptions – a middle-class Millennial might feel poor seeing others their age on TikTok with mansions or globetrotting, not appreciating that those are outliers or curated images. The result is a heightened sense of relative deprivation . Narratives of Generational Conflict: The past decade saw the rise of a kind of meme-fueled generational antagonism – “Boomers vs Millennials.” Each side sometimes caricatures the other (Boomers calling Millennials entitled; Millennials calling Boomers selfish). This adversarial framing, amplified by internet culture, can make Millennials interpret personal economic frustrations as someone’s fault – often Boomers (for voting in certain policies, for climate change, for hoarding wealth, etc.). While there are legitimate policy grievances (e.g., housing zoning controlled by older homeowners, or college funding cuts), the narrative can become one of victimhood : young people feeling that older generations broke the system or pulled the ladder up behind them. When that narrative is constantly reinforced online, it solidifies perceptions regardless of incremental improvements in data. It becomes almost an identity to be the “screwed generation.” As an example, the concept of “Boomer privilege” circulates widely – implying any Boomer had it easy economically – which a struggling Millennial might use to contextualize their own difficulties. The psychological comfort of an external blame (the economy is rigged against us) can overshadow dry statistics showing things aren’t so dire. Salience of Recessions: Millennials’ formative years were marked by back-to-back historic crises: the 2008–09 Great Recession and the 2020 COVID-19 recession. Experiencing severe economic downturns early in one’s career can have an outsized impact on attitudes (economists speak of “scarring”). Indeed, research shows Millennials have more risk-aversion in investing and lower trust in financial institutions due to seeing market crashes and bailouts in young adulthood. If your first job market was the worst in decades (as for graduates around 2009) or you were furloughed during COVID, those events leave a narrative imprint: “the economy doesn’t work for us.” Even though recovery happened, the sense of precariousness remains. This can make Millennials less likely to notice subsequent gains because they’re always waiting for the other shoe to drop. The strong post-2020 asset inflation that boosted wealth might be viewed skeptically as a bubble that could burst, rather than true progress. Inflation of Expectations: There is also a concept that each generation expects to do better than their parents – not just equally well. By that yardstick, even being on par might feel like a letdown. Boomers famously were raised in the post-WWII boom and many surpassed their Depression-era parents’ standard of living. Millennials grew up often in middle-class comfort and perhaps expected to easily replicate that. But starting salaries relative to the cost of a middle-class lifestyle made that challenging, especially in expensive metro areas many reside in. So even if objectively they reach similar net worth by 40, maybe their• • 16 parents already owned a home by 40 whereas they only just managed to buy (or still haven’t). This expectation gap breeds narratives of decline. The cultural script that each generation will automatically enjoy more prosperity hit a snag with Millennials – not because Millennials are actually poorer than their parents (most will eventually surpass parents’ wealth due to inheritance or dual incomes), but because the trajectory was different (slower start, big setbacks, then a catch-up). Culturally, that feels wrong, so it’s interpreted as something fundamentally broken. Media Correction Lag: It’s worth noting that only recently have some media outlets started to push back on the doom narrative, citing new data. For instance, a Newsweek piece in early 2024 highlighted that Millennials (and Gen Z adults) are actually wealthier than previous generations at the same age. But such counter-narratives are still emerging and not as emotionally resonant as the prior decade’s gloom. It takes time for perceptions to change, and positive trends often receive less coverage than negative ones did. Additionally, complexity doesn’t go viral – telling a story of “Millennials were behind but have now caught up in median wealth, although housing is still tough” is less clear-cut than “Millennials are broke.” So the nuance can be lost. Impact of Perception: Why does perception matter? Because beliefs can influence behavior and policy. If a generation believes the economic game is rigged, they may support different political measures (e.g., student debt cancellation, higher taxes on the rich, housing reform) and may also make different personal choices (like delaying family formation due to pessimism about costs). Already, one can argue that the widespread feeling of economic insecurity among Millennials has shaped politics – fueling movements around inequality and debt relief. It also affects mental health: constant social comparison and financial anxiety contribute to stress (some talk of a Millennial “quarter-life crisis” or burnout culture linked to always feeling behind). Myth vs Reality in Perceptions: - Myth (Perception): “Millennials are the first generation to do worse than their parents; the American Dream is dying for them.” Reality: Broad measures do not show Millennials permanently worse off – incomes and wealth (adjusted for age) are similar or slightly higher than past generations . However , specific challenges (housing costs, higher debt) create the feeling of falling behind. - Myth: “If Millennials feel poorer, it must be true – stats must be lying.” Reality: Feelings are real, but they often reflect visible pain points rather than total financial position. For instance, having $30K of student debt (very tangible) can overshadow the fact that one’s 401(k) grew by $30K (less tangible) – leading to a perception of being “in a hole” even if net worth is neutral. - Myth: “Boomers had it easy; Millennials have it uniquely hard.” Reality: Each generation faces different economic conditions. Boomers did have cheaper college and housing relative to income, but they also faced 18% mortgage rates in the 80s and harsher inflation in the 70s, which Millennials didn’t. Millennials faced a tougher job market early on but now enjoy tech-driven conveniences and low unemployment in late 2010s. The difficulty is different , not unilaterally worse in every way. However , the narrative of uniquely hard times has been amplified culturally, and that shapes perception more than balanced comparisons. In conclusion, the perception of Millennial economic malaise is a case where myth and reality diverge . The myth (in sense of widely believed narrative) is that Millennials are broadly worse off and on a downward trajectory, whereas the reality (in data) is that they have largely caught up in wealth and income by now. The reasons for the myth’s endurance lie in human psychology and social dynamics – salient hardships, media74 3 17 reinforcement, and the potent storytelling of generational conflict. Recognizing this gap between perception and reality is important: it suggests that improving factual awareness (like highlighting the Fed data) could alleviate some undue pessimism, but it also underscores that policy should address those pain points that are real (like high housing costs) to ease the lived experience that fuels the narrative. Myths often carry a kernel of truth – Millennials did face real headwinds, and many still do – but the broader reality includes significant strengths and improvements that merit acknowledgment. 6. Structural Drivers of Generational Wealth Outcomes: Assets, Housing, and Policy Having dissected the statistical and psychological aspects of generational wealth, we turn to the underlying structural factors that have produced the current generational wealth landscape. Key among these are rising asset prices , housing supply dynamics , and public policy design . These factors are deeply interwoven – for example, policy (monetary, fiscal, tax, regulatory) has influenced asset markets and housing construction – and together they have shaped how wealth is distributed across generations. Asset Price Inflation and Who Benefited One of the most consequential trends of the past four decades has been the dramatic increase in asset values – including stocks, bonds, real estate, and more. This asset price inflation has generally outpaced income growth, meaning those who owned assets accrued wealth much faster than those living paycheck to paycheck. Generationally, this tended to favor older cohorts who already had assets when the big run- ups occurred. Stock Market Boom: Since the early 1980s, the U.S. stock market (S&P 500) has increased roughly 30-fold in nominal terms (and about 10-fold in inflation-adjusted terms) . Baby Boomers were in prime position to benefit: they were entering or in mid-career just as defined-contribution retirement plans (401(k)s) emerged in the 1980s and the longest bull market in history took off in the 1980s-1990s. By investing in stocks through retirement accounts or otherwise, many Boomers saw exponential growth in their portfolios. Generation X also benefited, but they were a bit younger (many started investing in the 1990s or 2000s). Millennials, on the other hand, came of age after a lot of the gains had already been made (e.g., stock indices were already high in the 2000s) – though they still participated in the 2010s bull market. Crucially, ownership rates matter: Boomers had higher stock ownership rates at a given age than Millennials did. By 2020, only ~5% of Millennials’ wealth was in direct stock holdings, with more in retirement accounts, whereas Boomers in their younger years had pensions (indirectly benefiting from stock growth) and later also got into stock investing. The Fed’s low interest rate policies post-2008 and quantitative easing poured fuel on asset prices (stocks, real estate), benefitting asset owners disproportionately. Since older , wealthier folks own most stocks, these policies inadvertently widened the gap. Put bluntly, the surge in financial asset values lifted Boomer and Gen X wealth more simply because they held more assets to begin with . Housing Boom and Shortage: Housing is both a necessity and the largest asset for most families. Since 1980, and especially since 2000, many areas have seen home prices grow far faster than general inflation or wages. By 2023, national home prices (real terms) were roughly double what they were in 1980. Boomers who bought homes in the 1970s–1990s often locked in very low• 33 • 18 purchase prices (even if interest rates were high, they refinanced later). They then rode a multi- decade wave of home appreciation, particularly in coastal cities. For example, in California or New York, it’s common to hear of Boomers who bought a house for $100,000 in 1980 that is worth $1+ million today. Millennials, in contrast, confronted historically expensive housing when they entered the market in the 2010s-2020s. Why did housing get so pricey? Partly due to supply failing to keep up with demand , and partly due to policy and preferences . After the 2008 housing crash, homebuilding plummeted and never fully recovered to pre-2008 levels. A decade of underbuilding meant by the 2020s we had a cumulative shortage of around 3.5 to 4 million housing units relative to population needs . A 2024 Realtor .com report estimated the U.S. was short 3.8 million homes relative to buyer demand . This shortage inevitably drives up prices – a classic case of high demand (Millennials reaching home-buying age) hitting low supply. The distribution of this shortage is also key: it's worst in big job-rich metros where many Millennials want to live. Zoning and Housing Policy: Why not just build more homes? Here’s where local policy plays a major role. The predominance of single-family zoning (covering ~75% of U.S. residential land in many cities) restricts higher-density development . Many Boomers, as incumbent homeowners and local voters, have tended historically to oppose dense new housing in their neighborhoods (the NIMBY phenomenon), which has resulted in strict zoning, lengthy permitting, and Nimbyism slowing development. This is a case where an older generation’s political influence – protecting their property values and neighborhood character – inadvertently (or sometimes intentionally) reduced housing affordability for younger folks by constraining supply . Some states and cities are now pushing reforms (legalizing duplexes, ADUs, etc.), but these changes are slow. The housing supply crisis thus has roots in policy decisions that spanned decades, often led by older property owners. Another policy factor is that interest rates were kept ultra-low for most of 2010–2021, enabling cheap mortgages and boosting buying power , which bid up home prices further (cheap credit = people can pay more, pushing prices up). Good for those who already owned (Boomers saw values rise), challenging for first-time buyers (mostly Millennials). So, rising asset prices – in housing and stocks – were fueled by low rates and tight supply and ended up enriching those who already owned assets , who were disproportionately older generations. Wealth Structure Effects: The result of these asset trends is that wealth has become more about assets appreciating than labor earnings . Boomers got a double advantage: they had solid incomes (many benefitted from strong unions or stable corporate careers in their prime) and their assets soared. Millennials work in an era of slower wage growth (except at the very top) and skyrocketing asset prices that they had to buy into. However , it’s crucial to note that Millennials who did manage to buy homes or invest in stocks benefited greatly in the 2010s-2020s . The SCF data shows Millennials’ wealth surging partly because many finally bought homes around 2020 and then saw huge equity gains in 2020–2022 as home prices jumped ~30% nationally. Those who had 401(k)s also saw big gains in the 2019–2021 market boom. So asset inflation eventually helped Millennials too – but typically the ones who were slightly better off to start (could afford down payments or have investment accounts). This raises internal generational inequality: affluent Millennials build wealth, while those who couldn’t access assets feel further behind.7576 75 • 77 7778 • 19 Policy Design and Generational Effects We’ve touched on some policies (monetary policy, zoning, pension systems) already. Let’s systematically consider how policy design contributed to generational wealth outcomes : Monetary Policy (Interest Rates & QE): The Federal Reserve’s policies have indirect generational impacts. The long-term decline of interest rates from ~15% in 1981 to ~0% in the 2010s massively increased asset values (bond yields down = bond prices up; low discount rates = higher stock valuations; cheap mortgages = higher house prices). This effectively rewarded asset holders (older/ richer) and punished savers who relied on interest (often older too, ironically, but the wealthy compensated by asset gains). Post-2008 quantitative easing injected liquidity that inflated financial asset prices. Younger people without assets didn’t directly benefit, though they benefited from jobs saved by avoiding a worse recession. During COVID, extraordinary Fed and fiscal measures pumped up both stock markets and housing (via low rates, stimulus checks, etc.). In 2020–21, many Millennials actually entered asset markets (stock trading boom, crypto, low-rate mortgages) and thus shared in those gains. But if one generation already owned a lot pre-2020 (Boomers had, say, $10T in stocks), a 20% market rise gives them $2T; Millennials with $1T get $0.2T. Thus absolute gaps widen. In sum, Fed policy aimed at macro stability inadvertently favored capital over labor and those with existing capital – skewing wealth older/upward. However , we must also note that extremely high inflation (which the Fed tries to curb) hurts those living on fixed incomes and wages – so the Fed’s mandate cuts both ways for generations. Fiscal Policy & Taxation: Tax policies can either mitigate or exacerbate wealth gaps. Over the last few decades, many tax policies favored capital and older folks. For example: Mortgage interest deduction and other homeowner subsidies have long favored those who own homes (tending to be older on average) over renters. 401(k)/IRA tax breaks encourage retirement saving (good for all, but those with more income benefit more from the tax shelters). Capital gains tax rates are lower than ordinary income rates, benefiting investors. Boomers who have large stock portfolios pay a lower rate on those gains than a Millennial pays on wages in many cases. Estate Tax : as mentioned, very few estates pay tax now due to high exemptions, allowing wealthy Boomers to pass more to heirs untaxed. Social Security has an intergenerational aspect: it’s largely a pay-as-you-go system where current workers (Millennials/Gen X) pay for current retirees (Boomers). Social Security has greatly reduced elderly poverty (a success), but it also means a transfer from younger to older in real time. Millennials worry (perhaps overly pessimistically) that by the time they retire, the system may be less generous (trust fund depletion around 2034 could prompt benefit cuts if not fixed). This uncertainty feeds the narrative that “Boomers will get theirs, Millennials might not.” Medicare similarly is funded by current taxes and is on unsustainable footing as Boomers age, posing another potential future burden on younger taxpayers if costs aren’t controlled. Education and Labor: A policy design shift was the disinvestment in public higher education. Boomers often attended college when tuition was low or free (University of California was nominal cost in the 1960s, etc.) due to government funding. By the time Millennials went to college, many states had cut support, passing costs to students (hence ballooning student debt). This is a clear policy-driven generational difference: public policy chose to subsidize one generation’s education• • • • • • • • 20 more than the next. Likewise, labor policies like declining union power and a lower inflation-adjusted minimum wage affected Millennials’ early earnings relative to what prior generations might have had if those trends didn’t change. Housing and Urban policy: We discussed zoning, which is local policy. There’s also the lack of a robust national housing policy; some argue federal incentives could encourage more building. Instead, the policy status quo has let housing scarcity worsen, benefiting existing owners (often older) at the expense of young buyers. Additionally, property tax limitations like California’s Prop 13 (keeping taxes low for long-time owners) tend to lock in older owners and shift the tax burden to newer (younger) buyers who pay disproportionately higher taxes on same-valued homes. All these micro policies cumulatively favored those who “got in early” in housing. Retirement Systems Transition: The shift from Defined Benefit (DB) pensions to Defined Contribution (DC) plans was a major policy and corporate shift around the 1980s-2000s. Older Boomers often still have some pension income; younger Boomers and Gen X have fewer , and Millennials almost none. This means Millennials must save more individually for retirement (401k etc.) whereas many Boomers got a guaranteed pension. The burden of risk shifted onto individuals. If Millennials do save diligently, they could end up with similar or even greater assets (especially with markets doing well); but many do not or cannot save enough, which could lead to shortfalls. This system change structurally made retirement outcomes more unequal (because returns vary, some don’t save, etc.) whereas DB pensions gave a stable floor . In essence, a policy/business design change placed more responsibility on individuals at the same time other headwinds (student debt, expensive housing) made it harder to save early on . Policies after Crises: The policy responses to crises also have generational effects. After 2008, policies focused on stabilizing banks and aiding homeowners (loan modifications, etc.), which in effect helped those who already had homes (disproportionately older). Underwater young homeowners got help too, but there were fewer of them. In the COVID crisis, fiscal policy (stimulus checks, expanded unemployment, etc.) actually benefited younger folks a lot (many Millennials got checks and student loan pauses, etc.), which may have indirectly allowed some to save for homes (indeed 2020–21 saw many Millennials finally buy houses, oddly thanks to circumstances of low rates and remote work enabling moves). This suggests not all policy is against Millennials; some recent policies (e.g., proposed student debt forgiveness, first-time homebuyer credits, etc.) are explicitly aimed at relieving young-adult burdens. In summary, policy design over the last half-century often didn’t consciously pick winners by generation, but its effects systematically favored those who were older or already asset-rich . Easy money policy inflated assets, benefiting older asset owners; zoning and housing policy protected incumbents; tax policy favored capital and existing homeowners; shifts in retirement and education funding put more on the young. These structural factors help explain why Boomers ended up with so large a wealth share, and why younger cohorts felt headwinds. The “new generational wealth structure” – where Boomers hold an unprecedented half of wealth, Gen X a solid share, and Millennials only a small slice – is not a random outcome. It’s the product of these long-running trends. • • • 21 Clarifying the New Generational Wealth Structure Let’s tie it together: Rising asset prices, constrained housing supply, and policy frameworks have led to a scenario where: - Older generations (Boomers) have high aggregate wealth due to asset appreciation (houses, stocks) and the tail end of supportive mid-century institutions (pensions, cheaper college, etc.). They hold wealth longer (slow drawdown) and many will pass it on late in life. - Middle generation (Gen X) is often called the “sandwich” generation – they did not benefit as much from the postwar golden age as Boomers did, and came of age in an era of rising inequality and the tech bubble/Great Recession, but they still were able to buy into housing before the biggest recent surges, and now are hitting peak earnings. Gen X’s wealth share (~26%) is less than Boomers’ but will rise as they inherit from Silent Gen parents and as Boomers start to pass assets. They stand to be the main beneficiaries of Boomer inheritances in the 2020s-2030s (since Gen X are mostly the children of Boomers). - Younger generation (Millennials) started with a low base but have recently shown faster-than-expected wealth gains . They benefited from the 2010s bull market (if invested) and from pandemic-era housing and stock surges. Those gains were partly due to policy (low rates, stimulus) that, while not aimed at generation per se, ended up lifting their cohort’s finances. For instance, Millennial homeownership jumped from 40% to 50% in just a few years during the pandemic – a big shift – largely because of low interest rates and remote work allowing moves. However , the structure of high asset prices means that Millennials had to leverage more (bigger mortgages) to get in the game. If asset prices stay high or climb, those who got in will be fine or great; if there’s a downturn, they might be more exposed (less cushion). So there’s volatility in their future. Importantly, one should clarify that higher asset prices are a double-edged sword . They boost wealth on paper for owners (making Boomers look very rich because their home is worth 3x what they paid, etc.), but they also reduce affordability for non-owners. High stock valuations mean future returns might be lower (diminishing Millennials’ upside going forward compared to the past). High home prices mean younger buyers must either stretch financially or remain renters (limiting their wealth-building via home equity). In that sense, the structure we have is somewhat self-perpetuating: wealth begets wealth. That is why, absent policy changes, Millennials who started behind might have stayed behind – but fortunately for them (and somewhat unexpectedly), the 2019–2022 period delivered them enough wealth growth to catch up to earlier cohorts. This was partly luck (market timing) and partly policies that, unintentionally, boosted asset owners in that cohort. Inflation and Debt: A quick note on inflation and debt: Historically, inflation can redistribute wealth between borrowers and lenders and between generations. High inflation in the 1970s eroded the real value of fixed-rate mortgages, effectively benefiting home-owning Boomers then (their real debt burdens shrank) while hurting savers (often older people on fixed incomes). In the 2020s, moderate inflation could likewise erode student loan burdens or mortgage burdens if wages keep up. However , persistent high inflation would be harmful to younger folks too (harder to save for a house if everything’s pricier). The interplay is complex, but currently, policy is aimed at controlling inflation to a moderate level. Future Policy Considerations: If the goal is to ameliorate generational disparities, certain policy ideas emerge from this analysis: - Boosting housing supply (relaxing zoning, encouraging building) to bring prices to more affordable levels relative to income, which would benefit younger buyers and the economy (though current owners might see slower gains). - Tax reforms that might include higher estate taxes or inheritance taxes on large bequests to recycle some wealth, or incentives for inter vivos transfers to younger family members when it can do more good. - Strengthening social safety nets (like making Social Security solvent, or expanding healthcare in retirement) so that Boomers might feel freer to spend or give assets (if they are76 22 less afraid of medical bankruptcy, for instance). - Policies to reduce student debt burdens or lower education costs for future generations, so they can start adult life with a cleaner balance sheet. - Encouraging retirement savings among young workers (auto-enrollment in 401ks, etc.) to ensure Millennials/Gen Z build assets earlier to benefit from compounding as Boomers did. Such policies could help align the myth and reality: if Millennials perceive systemic unfairness, structural reforms can address root causes (housing, education, etc.) and thereby also change perceptions over time. Conclusion of Structural Factors: Rising asset prices, constrained housing, and legacy policies essentially designed the current generational wealth outcomes. None of this was inevitable – different policy choices or economic patterns could have led to a more even distribution. But given what happened, we have a situation where Boomers hold most wealth and younger cohorts started slow but are catching up thanks to late boosts. The “new generational wealth structure” is one of both tremendous concentration (older gens holding the lion’s share) and surprising convergence at median levels (younger gen medians recovering). Understanding these underlying drivers helps dispel simplistic myths (e.g., “Boomers stole all the wealth”) while acknowledging real structural issues (e.g., housing policy) that need solutions. Conclusion: The generational wealth story in the United States is far more complex than the popular narrative of “rich Boomers, poor Millennials” – and it’s not a zero-sum game of one generation versus another . Empirical reality reveals both myths to debunk and genuine challenges to address. Millennials have faced headwinds – high costs, economic crises – but have largely overcome them to reach parity or even a slight edge in median wealth by age 40 . Baby Boomers hold an outsized aggregate wealth, but that is as much a function of demographics, policy, and asset market history as of any individual failing or virtue. And while Boomers’ collective wealth is enormous (over $80 trillion) , it’s not as if all Boomers are flush millionaires; wealth inequality and slow drawdowns mean much of that wealth remains concentrated and will transfer slowly. Data-rich analysis from the Federal Reserve sources (SCF, DFA) gives us ground truth: median net worths, wealth shares, inheritance ages, etc. that dispel sweeping myths. We saw that Millennials’ median net worth (inflation-adjusted) modestly exceeds that of Gen X and Boomers at the same age ; that Boomers’ dominance in total wealth contrasts with only moderate per-household advantages ; that the average inheritance now comes in one’s 50s , delaying the benefits of the Great Wealth Transfer; that Boomers are drawing down wealth at a trickle, often out of caution and legacy motives ; and that perceptions of generational decline, while understandable, are often informed by internet-fueled comparisons and specific pain points rather than holistic financial outcomes . Intellectual coherence requires reconciling these facets: Yes, Millennials are burdened by student loans; yes, housing is less affordable than it was; but also yes, Millennials are on track to accumulate substantial wealth, especially as they inherit later on (albeit unevenly). Yes, Boomers had advantages (cheap assets, pensions), but they also faced different hurdles (e.g., high inflation early in careers) and not every Boomer is living large. In fact, many face long retirements with uncertainty. The myths that “Millennials are financially doomed” or “Boomers won’t share the wealth” are too crude. The reality is more about structural conditions that can be changed: building more housing, easing the cost of3 19 3 27 37 52 68 2 23 education, shoring up retirement systems, and encouraging wealth-building opportunities for the young. Such measures would ensure that each generation can thrive without zero-sum thinking. Ultimately, the data tell a cautiously optimistic story: Millennials are doing better than expected and are poised to receive great transfers (eventually), Gen X is well positioned to become the next wealth leaders (with Boomers’ mantle passing slowly), and Boomers – the richest generation in history – will gradually share their prosperity, whether intentionally or by the inevitabilities of life. The challenge ahead is managing this transition equitably and efficiently. By dispelling myths and focusing on facts, we can promote policies based on reality, not erroneous narratives. In closing , generational economics in the U.S. is not a tale of unmitigated decline, but rather a nuanced evolving landscape. The “Millennial disadvantage” has been overstated – today’s young adults are actually slightly ahead of where yesterday’s young adults were. However , significant perception gaps persist, driven by cultural and psychological factors. Bridging those gaps will require continued public education with data (like this report) and addressing the real structural issues that underlie the perceptions (like making housing and education more attainable). If we succeed, we can replace resentment with understanding, and replace fatalism with empowerment for the younger generation. Every generation faces its myths; by confronting them with reality, we ensure that the American Dream – continually reinterpreted – remains alive and attainable for all.
