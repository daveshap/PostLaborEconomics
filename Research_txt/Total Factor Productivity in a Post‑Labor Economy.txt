Total Factor Productivity in a Post‑Labor Economy Introduction Advances in automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics are transforming production processes and raising the prospect of a “post-labor” economic paradigm in which machines perform a large share of work. This paper examines how Total Factor Productivity (TFP) – the Solow residual that captures technological progress and efficiency – behaves under these conditions. We explore theoretical insights and empirical evidence on TFP in an era of synthetic labor and consider why productivity surges may not translate into broad-based welfare gains. We also discuss implications for developing economies and propose institutional and measurement reforms to better capture and share the benefits of automation-driven productivity growth. Throughout, we maintain a formal academic tone and structure the discussion in sections with citations to relevant literature and reports. Defining TFP as the Solow Residual and Technological Progress In standard growth theory, Total Factor Productivity (TFP) is the portion of output not explained by the accumulation of measured inputs, traditionally capital and labor . It is often measured as the Solow residual , defined as the increase in output that remains after accounting for growth in capital and labor inputs . Robert Solow characterized rising productivity as achieving higher output with constant capital and labor – hence TFP represents the “residual” gains attributed to technological progress and efficiency improvements . In growth accounting, TFP is calculated by subtracting the input-driven part of output growth (weighted by input shares) from total output growth. What remains – the Solow residual – reflects increases in output that cannot be explained by more labor hours or more capital investment . Because of this, TFP growth is interpreted as an economy becoming more efficient or innovative, for example via better technology, improved organization, or higher skilled labor . Modern usage treats TFP as synonymous with multi-factor productivity , emphasizing that it captures the combined efficiency of all inputs . In short, TFP is “what is left” after accounting for inputs, and thus serves as a proxy for technological change and the overall effectiveness with which labor and capital are used . It is important to note that TFP is an outcome measure rather than a direct metric of technology itself. Any growth in output that is not due to measured input growth will raise TFP. This includes classical technological innovation (better machines, processes, and ideas) but can also include unmeasured or qualitative improvements in inputs. As a result, while rising TFP generally signals technological progress, it is essentially an “unexplained” residual and can sometimes reflect measurement challenges or omitted factors. As we turn to the impact of automation and AI, this dual nature of TFP – as a genuine indicator of innovation but also a catch-all residual – will be critical in interpreting productivity trends. Automation, AI, and Challenges in TFP Measurement Automation and AI are redefining how we measure inputs and outputs, introducing new challenges for TFP measurement . When robots and AI systems take over tasks, they effectively act as a form of capital12 13 43 5 3 1 – often high-tech capital – substituting for human labor . However , if the value of these new inputs is not fully captured in our economic statistics, the improvements they bring can show up as excess output growth in the residual (TFP). Two key issues stand out: the treatment of intangibles and the need for quality- adjusted capital measures . Uncapitalized intangibles. Modern AI systems and digital innovations rely heavily on intangible inputs like data, algorithms, software, and organizational know-how. Many of these intangible assets are costly to develop but are not fully counted as capital formation in national accounts. For example, training a large language model or curating a massive dataset requires substantial investment, yet if those expenditures are treated as intermediate costs or R&D (rather than as building a capital asset), the resulting AI capability is essentially “unmeasured capital.” When such intangibles drive output gains, measured TFP can be distorted. As Brynjolfsson, Syverson and others have noted, rapid investment in AI-related intangibles can lead to a “productivity J-curve” : in early phases, output is understated (and TFP growth appears slow) because resources are devoted to building intangible capital that isn’t counted as output; later , once the intangible assets start producing results, output jumps and TFP suddenly rises . In other words, missing intangible investment can first depress measured productivity and then, when returns materialize, inflate measured TFP growth because the input that generated the growth was never fully recorded . For instance, if firms expend effort on developing proprietary AI algorithms or data (which are only partially captured in software or R&D statistics), the subsequent efficiency gains from those algorithms will show up as higher output with “no extra input,” boosting TFP. Studies argue that excluding the production of intangible AI capital from GDP leads to an understatement of true input growth and an overstatement of the residual . Over time, as these intangibles yield output, measured productivity can surge – essentially a catch-up for earlier underestimation. This indicates a need to modernize measurement by capitalizing more intangible investments (data, AI models, etc.) so that improvements from them are attributed to input growth rather than the TFP residual. Without such adjustments, official TFP statistics may misrepresent the timing and magnitude of technology’s impact. Quality-adjusted capital (advanced robots). A parallel measurement issue arises with high-quality capital goods like advanced robotics. Automation often entails rapid improvements in the quality and capability of machines – for example, next-generation industrial robots or AI-enabled equipment that can perform tasks far more efficiently than prior generations. If statistical agencies measure capital input simply by expenditure or physical counts without fully adjusting for quality, then a dramatic improvement in a robot’s effectiveness can register as TFP growth rather than capital deepening. Quality-adjusted price indices attempt to account for this by deflating capital investment by an index that reflects performance gains (as is commonly done for computers). Research shows that robot prices, when adjusted for quality improvements, have declined very rapidly , akin to IT equipment. One study found an 80% drop in the quality-adjusted price of industrial robots from 1990–2005 in some economies . In the United States, a proxy index for information processing equipment (applied to robots) fell by roughly 70% over 15 years . These declines mean that for the same dollar cost, the economy is obtaining much more productive capital. If we did not adjust for quality (i.e. if we treated a $50,000 robot in 2025 as the same “capital” as a $50,000 robot in 2000, despite the latter being far less capable), then the extra output from the superior modern robot would inflate TFP. By contrast, properly accounting for quality improvements attributes those gains to capital input growth . In practice, incorporating hedonic quality adjustments for AI and robotic equipment is challenging but necessary. The complexity is evidenced by differing national estimates of robot price trends – for example, the U.S. saw an estimated –11% annual quality-adjusted price change in robots in one period, while Japan saw –28%, illustrating how sensitive calculations can be . Nonetheless, consensus is that automation hardware has become much cheaper for its capability, so capital67 8 7 67 910 11 1211 2 input measures must reflect this to avoid overstating TFP. In summary, the age of AI demands refinement of input measurements : treating data and algorithms as capital investments and updating deflators for cutting-edge equipment. These steps help ensure that the Solow residual continues to mean genuine efficiency gains, not artifacts of mismeasurement . Synthetic Labor, Capital Deepening, and Potential TFP Surges As automation and AI proliferate, “synthetic labor” (machine-based labor , both cognitive and physical) can dramatically raise output while reducing the need for human labor input. In growth terms, this is equivalent to a massive increase in the effective capital per worker and can manifest as surges in measured TFP under certain conditions. We analyze this dynamic through the lenses of capital deepening, task automation, and the prospect of recursive AI-driven innovation. Capital deepening vs. TFP. When robots or AI perform tasks previously done by workers, the immediate effect is often characterized as capital deepening : more capital (machines) is now doing the work per unit of labor . In a traditional growth accounting sense, some of the output gain from this transition is attributed to capital input growth (since we have invested in more machines). However , to the extent that the new automated systems are far more efficient, or their contribution is not fully captured by input measures, the extra output shows up as TFP. For example, if a factory replaces workers with robots, output per worker may skyrocket – some of that productivity gain is due to having more capital per worker , but any part of the gain beyond what the increase in capital (weighted by its share) can explain is counted as TFP. In practice, automation often brings both substantial capital deepening and higher TFP by enabling processes to be reoptimized and scaled beyond human limits. Empirical task-based models (e.g. Acemoglu & Restrepo) suggest that automation can raise TFP modestly via cost savings, though primarily it reallocates income from labor to capital . Nonetheless, when “synthetic labor” dramatically improves performance on tasks, we may observe periods of unusually rapid TFP growth – essentially reflecting a leap in efficiency. One reason is that AI and robotics aren’t mere replacements; they often can perform tasks faster, more accurately, and at larger scale than humans, thus producing more output from the same inputs . Indeed, Aghion, Jones & Jones model AI as the latest form of automation capable of taking over tasks once thought beyond machines (from driving to medical diagnostics) . If AI can execute these tasks with super-human productivity, then even after accounting for the investment in AI systems, an unexplained residual productivity jump can remain. In short, replacing labor with AI can boost TFP especially if the AI is vastly more productive than the labor it replaces or if traditional metrics undercount the new inputs. Task automation and the Solow residual. Another angle is the reallocation of tasks in the production function. As automation expands, the set of tasks performed by human labor shrinks and tasks performed by capital grows . If we imagine an extreme case of a post-labor economy where human labor input is negligible, output is produced by capital (machines) and technology. Growth would then come from accumulating machines and improving technology. In the limit, measured labor input growth goes to zero, so all output growth would come from capital growth and TFP. Depending on how we treat AI “labor ,” we might consider some of it as an increase in capital services. However , standard growth accounting might not fully capture the expansion of machine capabilities. Thus, a society with widespread automation could register high TFP growth because output keeps rising even as human labor hours fall or stagnate. This scenario can be interpreted as the economy moving up a high-productivity frontier due to task automation : by automating routine and even complex tasks, the economy can achieve more output with the same humans. This is analogous to historical episodes like the mechanization of agriculture, which greatly increased output per farmer (huge productivity gains) while freeing workers for other sectors. The13 14 15 16 3 difference now is the potential breadth of AI-driven automation across both physical and cognitive tasks. AI systems can augment or even replace cognitive labor , potentially yielding an acceleration in productivity akin to past industrial revolutions. Indeed, some researchers argue AI is a General Purpose Technology (GPT) with pervasive impact, much like electricity or computing, meaning it will spur complementary innovations and recursive improvements . In theory, if AI itself helps develop better AI (a recursive self-improvement loop), one could see an outsized effect on TFP – a point that touches on “singularities” or runaway growth scenarios considered by Aghion et al. (2017) . Recursive AI-driven innovation. A particularly intriguing possibility is that AI not only automates existing tasks but also accelerates the creation of new ideas and technologies – effectively becoming a force in research and development. Classic endogenous growth theory often ties TFP growth to research effort (number of scientists, R&D spending, etc.). If AI can augment or even replace human researchers in generating innovations, the constraint of human capital on growth could be relaxed. Jones (2023) and others have explored models where AI in R&D can raise the economy’s innovation rate, potentially leading to faster TFP growth or even the theoretical “technological singularity” (ever-accelerating growth) if self- improvement cycles take hold . In practical terms, we already see AI being used to design new algorithms, drugs, or engineering solutions – a hint of AI-driven productivity in innovation itself . Aghion, Jones & Jones (2019) highlight that while AI could greatly expand knowledge production, overall growth may still face bottlenecks from sectors that are hard to automate (echoing Baumol’s cost disease) . Thus, fully autonomous innovation could theoretically create a surge in TFP as each generation of AI creates an even better next generation, but real-world frictions (diminishing returns, essential human elements, etc.) may temper this. Nonetheless, even short of a singularity, synthetic cognitive labor in research could boost the long-run TFP growth rate by increasing the pace of innovation (for example, AI speeding up scientific discovery or software development). Empirically, it is too early to quantify this effect, but it forms a critical part of the optimistic scenarios for AI-driven economic growth. In summary, synthetic labor and automation influence TFP through two channels: static efficiency gains (doing the same tasks more efficiently, thus raising output per input) and dynamic innovation gains (creating new knowledge that pushes out the production frontier). Both can contribute to measured TFP. Many analyses, however , caution that while automation raises productivity, the pure TFP component (net of capital deepening) might be moderate unless complemented by those dynamic innovation effects . For instance, Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) find automation’s direct effect on TFP is relatively small – most output gains are offset by input increases or shifts in income shares. On the other hand, if AI enables entirely new capabilities, we could witness periods of TFP acceleration as the Solow residual captures the leap into new production possibilities. The next section turns to empirical evidence on whether such productivity effects are manifesting. Empirical Evidence on Automation’s Impact on Productivity Growth A central question is whether the spread of AI and robotics is already visible in macroeconomic productivity statistics, and what forecasts say about the future. Empirical evidence so far is mixed: some studies and institutions foresee an upcoming productivity boom driven by automation, while others find only modest contributions to date, akin to the “productivity paradox” of the computer age. We examine evidence and projections from international organizations (OECD, IMF), consulting analyses (McKinsey), and key academic studies.1718 19 1520 2122 14 4 Historical contributions of automation. Looking backward, industrial robots and IT have contributed to productivity growth, though they explain only a portion of the post-war gains. For example, a study by Graetz and Michaels found that in the 1990s and early 2000s, increased robot use in manufacturing raised labor productivity growth by about 0.36 percentage points annually , accounting for roughly one- sixth of overall productivity growth in the countries studied . Similarly, McKinsey Global Institute notes that the introduction of industrial robots in the 1990s contributed an estimated 0.4 percentage points to annual productivity growth in manufacturing, and the spread of information technology in the 2000s added about 0.6 percentage points per year . These figures suggest automation has had measurable but not revolutionary impacts so far – boosting productivity, but not enough to fully escape the broader slowdown in TFP growth seen in many advanced economies after 2005. Recent productivity uptick and AI’s role. In the past couple of years, there have been tentative signs of productivity revival in some economies, prompting debate about whether AI is finally kicking in. For instance, in the U.S. the second half of 2022 saw labor productivity and TFP rising at rates not seen since the late 1990s tech boom . The San Francisco Fed’s utilization-adjusted TFP measure grew at nearly 5% (annualized) in one recent quarter . Analysts have cautiously attributed this to factors like pandemic- related adjustments (remote work efficiencies) and delayed impacts of digital investments . While it is too early to say if this is the start of an AI-driven surge, it underscores that productivity can surprise on the upside when new technologies reach critical mass. Indeed, the RSM analysis points to adoption of AI, increased automation, and other changes as reasons to believe we may be “on the cusp of a productivity renaissance” in the coming decade . It also emphasizes that TFP is a better gauge of this than raw labor productivity, since TFP isolates technology’s impact by netting out capital accumulation . Forecasts of AI’s future impact. Looking ahead, projections vary widely. An OECD review summarized estimates from various studies and found that AI could boost annual labor productivity growth by anywhere from a few tenths of a percent up to over one percentage point, depending on assumptions . A mid- range consensus is that AI might add on the order of 0.3–0.6 percentage points to annual TFP growth in advanced economies over the next decade , which translates to roughly 0.5–0.9 percentage points faster labor productivity growth once additional capital is accounted for . For example, one OECD working paper derives a scenario of about a 0.25–0.6 pp increase in U.S. TFP growth per year due to AI, equivalent to 0.4–0.9 pp higher output per hour when factoring in typical capital deepening . The IMF has offered cautiously optimistic views as well. An IMF analysis for Europe finds that even with AI adoption, medium- term productivity gains might be modest (~1% cumulative TFP increase over five years) , but it notes this is actually larger than some estimates for the U.S. . This suggests a boost of only around 0.2 pp per year to productivity in Europe, reflecting slower diffusion or more regulatory frictions. At the global level, IMF leaders have argued that AI could significantly help productivity “rebound” if its diffusion is accelerated across all sectors , yet they also warn that policy support is needed to realize these gains. McKinsey’s global outlook is on the more optimistic end. In a 2018 simulation, McKinsey Global Institute projected that by 2030, AI adoption could raise global GDP by an additional 16% (approximately $13 trillion), boosting annual global GDP growth by about 1.2 percentage points relative to baseline . This implies a substantial acceleration, comparable to the introduction of past GPTs. McKinsey noted this impact would likely emerge gradually (following an S-curve of adoption) and be uneven across countries and firms . They also compared it to historical tech diffusion: AI’s annual boost (if 1.2% to GDP growth) would exceed the contributions of industrial robots or early IT, and be akin to the impact of the internet in the late 1990s and 2000s . However , McKinsey’s scenario assumes broad and effective AI uptake. It acknowledges challenges such as the need for complementary investments and the lag in23 24 2526 27 2829 30 2 3132 32 32 33 34 35 36 3738 24 5 realizing benefits. Indeed, “the productivity J-curve” hypothesis (Brynjolfsson et al.) aligns with a delay: significant intangible and reorganization investments are required before AI’s potential translates into measured productivity . Key academic studies. Researchers have also weighed in. Aghion, Jones & Jones (2019) theorized big long- term effects from AI (including the possibility of a “growth singularity”), but also emphasized constraints such as Baumol’s cost disease – the idea that some essential sectors with low productivity improvements can drag down aggregate growth . In line with that, Nordhaus (2015) and others have pointed out that even revolutionary technologies diffuse only gradually through an economy comprised of diverse sectors, some of which see little change. Acemoglu and Restrepo, examining U.S. data, find that automation so far has had significant distributional effects (job and wage polarization) but only modest positive effects on overall productivity and GDP . Their work suggests that task displacement by machines can create efficiency gains, but these are partly offset by adjustment costs and by the slow creation of new tasks . In contrast, other scholars like Bloom et al. have argued that AI could increase the ideas production function and thus raise the underlying rate of TFP growth, helping to counteract the declining productivity of research observed in recent decades. The range of views indicates considerable uncertainty. Some recent empirical estimates (e.g., by the OECD and academic economists) cluster around a 0.5% per year TFP uplift in optimistic scenarios – noticeable but not a dramatic doubling of growth. On the other hand, the possibility of a larger jump (1%+ per year added) is entertained by certain analysts (e.g., Goldman Sachs researchers or tech optimists), often contingent on fully leveraging generative AI and similar advances. In sum, the evidence so far does not show an across-the-board productivity explosion – indeed the 2010s were marked by puzzlingly slow TFP growth despite rapid digital innovation (the “modern productivity paradox”) . However , there are early signs and credible forecasts that the 2020s could see improved productivity performance as AI and automation technologies mature and diffuse. The magnitude of this improvement is debated: mainstream projections see moderate gains that could accumulate significantly over time, while more bullish scenarios suggest AI could usher in a new era of high TFP growth if breakthroughs like generative AI are widely applied. Either way, even a surge in TFP raises the question: who benefits from it? The next section delves into why faster TFP growth in a post-labor economy may not automatically translate into widely shared welfare gains. Post-Labor TFP Surges vs. Broadly Shared Welfare Gains A core concern in the post-labor paradigm is that even if TFP growth accelerates, the gains may accrue narrowly , leading to a decoupling between productivity and typical people’s incomes or welfare. There are several interrelated reasons for this, including the decoupling of productivity and pay, the concentration of economic rents in few hands, and rising costs in certain essential goods and services. We examine each in turn to understand why a productivity boom might not lift all boats without complementary policies. Productivity–income decoupling. In recent decades, many advanced economies have experienced a growing gap between aggregate productivity and median earnings. In the United States, for example, labor productivity (output per hour) has roughly doubled since 1979, but a typical worker’s real compensation has grown much more slowly . This well-documented productivity–pay gap means that rising TFP no longer guarantees proportional gains in living standards for the majority. The causes are debated (technological change, globalization, weaker labor institutions, etc.), but the trend is clear: productivity growth and wage growth for the median worker have diverged significantly since the3940 2122 4114 4232 24 43 6 late 20th century . In a post-labor scenario, this decoupling could worsen. If automation allows output to climb with minimal human labor , then unless there are mechanisms to distribute the output (through wages or other income transfers), the average person might not see commensurate benefits. Simply put, who owns the robots and AI? If the answer is concentrated capital owners, productivity gains could primarily flow to profits, shareholders, and top executives, rather than workers. We already see signs of this: labor’s share of national income has declined in many countries alongside advances in automation. Without intervention, a surge in TFP could thus coexist with stagnant median incomes, as the link between producing more and earning more is broken. This decoupling undermines the traditional social promise that innovation-driven growth improves everyone’s lot. It raises the specter of a high-TFP, high-output economy where a minority enjoys most of the gains while many others see little improvement or even face job/income loss. Rent concentration and inequality. A related issue is the concentration of rents from technology . Digital technologies often exhibit winner-takes-all dynamics (due to network effects, scale economies, and intellectual property), leading to dominant firms capturing outsized market shares and profits. In the AI era, we already observe that a handful of large tech companies and startups with key AI models are commanding enormous valuations and earnings. The OECD warns that AI development is concentrated in big tech firms and that uneven adoption could amplify inequality . Similarly, research finds that AI-driven growth tends to be skewed toward larger firms , increasing industry concentration . This matters for welfare because concentrated market power can allow firms to earn excess profits (economic rents) rather than passing productivity gains to consumers or workers. If, for example, one company’s AI dominates a sector , it could set prices to capture much of the value added. The distribution of gains then tilts toward capital owners. We have seen this with the rise of “superstar” firms across the tech sector . In a post-labor context, the owners of capital (machine owners) could command even more leverage. The result could be extreme income and wealth inequality , where TFP growth shows up in GDP and corporate profit metrics but not in broad household incomes. There is also the dimension of monopoly and monopsony : highly automated firms might not need to compete for labor (reducing workers’ bargaining power) and may exercise monopoly power in product markets, further concentrating wealth. Overall, without countervailing forces, automation can lead to what some call a “trickle-up” economy – productivity gains accumulate as capital income, dividends, and asset appreciation held by the already wealthy. This concentration of economic power can erode the inclusive benefits of growth and even slow growth in the long run (through reduced aggregate demand and underutilization of human potential). Essential-service inflation (Baumol’s cost disease). Even if productivity soars in many areas thanks to AI, there will likely remain sectors that are intrinsically labor-intensive or harder to automate , often providing essential services like healthcare, education, eldercare, or parts of the public sector . Baumol’s cost disease is the classic observation that sectors with slower productivity growth experience rising relative costs: as wages rise economy-wide (due to productivity gains elsewhere), sectors that cannot raise productivity as fast will see their costs (and prices) increase. Aghion, Jones & Jones (2019) emphasize that in the long run, growth can be constrained by those essential sectors that are hard to improve . In a post- labor scenario, one might initially think everything can be automated; however , in practice many crucial tasks (especially those involving complex human interaction, creativity, or care) might resist full automation or face societal constraints. If overall TFP is growing strongly in the automated parts of the economy, incomes (at least for some) and aggregate demand rise, but the bottleneck sectors respond by price inflation rather than output growth (because their productivity is stagnant). The result is that the gains from TFP may be partly offset by the higher real costs of things like medical care, education tuition, housing in thriving cities, etc. We already observe this pattern: in the last few decades, computing, electronics, and43 44 45 22 7 media have become dramatically cheaper (high productivity gains), while college tuition, childcare, and hospital services have skyrocketed in price, absorbing more of households’ budgets. Thus, even if AI makes many goods and services abundant and cheap, the welfare impact could be muted if the remaining expensive necessities claim a larger share of income . A surge in TFP under post-labor conditions could paradoxically coincide with felt economic strain for many households, if their wages don’t keep up and if they face high costs in areas that matter most for well-being (like health and housing). In addition, a scenario of rapid productivity in some sectors could drive resources (labor and capital) into those stagnant sectors (you still need teachers, nurses, etc.), further slowing aggregate growth – a dynamic described as “Baumol’s growth disease” . In essence, parts of the economy could act as a drag on the realized gains, and the benefits that do materialize may be consumed by rising costs of essentials, leaving disposable incomes tight. Other distributional and welfare issues. Beyond the three major themes above, there are further reasons a TFP boom might not equate to a social welfare boom. Employment effects are a concern: even if AI raises total output, workers who are displaced or downgraded to lower-paying service jobs will feel worse off, a phenomenon seen in past automation waves that contributed to regional inequalities and political discontent. If a post-labor economy cannot find productive roles for all people, then structural unemployment or underemployment could rise, with attendant social costs. Additionally, there may be mismatch between GDP and welfare if, for instance, AI improvements are not well captured in quality-of- life (some output gains might be in forms that don’t translate to human satisfaction, or conversely some improvements like free digital services raise welfare but not GDP). However , the crux is that without intervention, a high-TFP economy could concentrate wealth, decouple average and median outcomes, and see essential living costs climb, thereby failing to deliver broadly shared prosperity . This is why economists and policymakers stress that institutional factors – tax policy, competition policy, labor rights, education, social safety nets – will play a decisive role in whether an AI-driven productivity boost becomes a “miracle” for society or just a statistical uptick. The final sections of this paper will address how this challenge might be met. Developing Economies: Automation, TFP , and the Quest for Growth For developing countries, the advent of advanced automation poses a unique dilemma. Historically, many nations climbed the development ladder by absorbing labor into industrialization – moving workers from low-productivity agriculture or informal work into higher-productivity manufacturing and services. This process (experienced by East Asian economies, for example) allowed for both rapid TFP growth and massive job creation. But in a world where manufacturing is increasingly automated, robots may replace the need for cheap labor , potentially short-circuiting the industrialization pathway for today’s low-income countries. We explore whether automation-driven TFP growth in developing economies can compensate for weak labor absorption, and what the implications are. Premature deindustrialization. Economist Dani Rodrik has highlighted trends of “premature deindustrialization” where developing countries reach peak manufacturing employment at much lower income levels than earlier industrializers, partly due to technology and globalization. Automation in advanced countries can lead to reshoring of production (since cheap labor abroad is less crucial when robots do the work) . Indeed, improvements in robotics are poised to bring more manufacturing back to high-wage countries , as shorter , more automated production runs become economical domestically rather than outsourcing to low-wage locations . This means developing nations might find it harder to grow their manufacturing sectors – the traditional engine of broad-based development –22 4647 4647 8 because they face competition not just from other low-wage countries, but from machines. The ITIF report by Atkinson notes that while both rich and poor countries will benefit from the next production system, developing economies will likely benefit less , in part because robotics reduces the advantage of low labor costs and enables reshoring to advanced economies . This suggests that many low-income countries risk missing the manufacturing-led stage of growth, or seeing it stall at a smaller scale. If fewer workers can be absorbed into high-productivity jobs, these countries may struggle with persistent underemployment and slower convergence to rich-country income levels. TFP growth without jobs? One theoretical possibility is that developing countries could still enjoy TFP growth by adopting automation (thus increasing output), even if it doesn’t create many jobs. For instance, a country could use AI and advanced machines in agriculture to boost yields or in mining and resource extraction to raise output, leading to higher GDP per capita. However , if those technologies don’t employ many people, the gains might be concentrated (benefiting a small educated or capital-owning class, possibly foreign investors) and not solve the fundamental challenge of providing livelihoods for a growing population. Jobless growth could become a serious issue: an economy could have respectable TFP and GDP gains yet suffer from high unemployment or informal employment. Developing countries often have younger demographics and urgent needs to create millions of jobs annually. Automation risks hollowing out the middle-skill job ladder even before it’s fully built. It also could exacerbate inequality within these countries, as urban skilled workers benefit from technology while rural and unskilled workers are left behind. Leapfrogging and new opportunities. On a more optimistic note, some argue that developing economies might leapfrog directly into new sectors – for example, expanding in ICT services, digital finance, or other areas where human capital can complement technology. India’s growing IT and business-process outsourcing sectors are often cited as examples of leapfrogging industrialization. AI and digital platforms could enable new forms of entrepreneurship and services in developing contexts (e.g., telemedicine, e- learning, mobile banking reaching remote areas). If harnessed correctly, these could drive productivity gains and inclusion. Moreover , automation might raise global growth (and demand for commodities or services exports from developing nations), indirectly benefiting them. However , there is a risk that the gap between frontier and laggard economies widens. If AI adoption remains concentrated in high-income countries, global productivity disparities could increase . A recent IMF study finds that only about 40% of jobs in emerging markets are highly exposed to AI (versus 60% in advanced economies), implying lower potential immediate gains but also a risk of falling behind . In other words, developing countries might initially face fewer disruptions from AI (since many of their workers are in manual or low-tech jobs not yet automatable), but that also means they aren’t reaping as much benefit. Over time, this could translate into a growing productivity gap. Unequal diffusion of AI could exacerbate global inequality , echoing past technological divides . Can automation-driven TFP make up for missing jobs? In pure GDP per capita terms, it’s conceivable a country could get richer by automating (especially if it has capital to invest) even without creating manufacturing jobs. For resource-rich or very small countries, this might be a path (e.g., a Gulf state could use robots and AI to run oil rigs and infrastructure and rely on sovereign wealth distribution). But for large developing nations with tens of millions of workers, broad-based development requires mass employment in productive sectors . A service sector expansion (tourism, healthcare, education) can absorb some labor , but those often depend on incomes generated by manufacturing or export industries. If those export industries are automated and employ few people, the domestic consumer base and skill4849 50 5152 5250 9 formation can suffer . Some economists stress the importance of industrial policy in the AI era – i.e., policies that help develop new industries where humans can still have a comparative advantage or where technology complements rather than substitutes their labor (for example, creative industries, specialized agriculture, or care economy). Another aspect is education and skills: developing countries need to invest heavily in human capital so their workers can work alongside AI (in roles that require problem-solving, adaptation, and human-AI interaction). This could raise their AI complementarity – ensuring that, when AI is adopted, it augments local workers rather than replacing them . In practical terms, early evidence suggests a mixed picture. Some middle-income countries like China are aggressively adopting automation while also expanding manufacturing output – in effect, they are trading off labor intensity for higher productivity. China’s huge domestic market and capital resources make this feasible, though it raises questions about job creation for less-skilled workers. Poorer countries, lacking capital, may find it harder to automate extensively; ironically, that could leave them less productive but potentially with more menial jobs intact (at least until even cheaper automation arrives). In essence, automation could slow the structural transformation that has historically driven development, unless alternative pathways for labor absorption emerge. International organizations have noted these concerns. The World Bank and UNIDO have raised alarms that the Fourth Industrial Revolution might bypass low-income nations or entrench their role as raw material suppliers rather than allowing them to climb the value chain. McKinsey’s simulations indicated that developed economies might capture 20–25% GDP gains from AI, whereas developing economies might only capture 5–15% of additional GDP (relative to baseline) . This suggests a widening gap. The OECD similarly emphasizes the need for global cooperation to ensure AI benefits are shared and that developing countries are not left as “technology takers” with little value added. To summarize, automation-driven TFP growth alone is not a panacea for developing economies . It may raise output, but without employment and inclusive institutions, it will not solve and may even worsen issues of joblessness and inequality. Developing countries face a dual challenge: harness new technologies to boost productivity and growth, but also find ways to create sufficient good jobs. Policies may need to encourage sectors where human labor is still essential or to manage the transition by improving education, social protection, and possibly slower automation in certain areas until the workforce can shift. The next section will propose some reforms along these lines to better capture and distribute the gains from AI and automation – both within countries and globally. Institutional and Measurement Reforms for an AI-Driven Productivity Era Achieving the potential of synthetic labor-driven TFP growth while ensuring broad welfare gains will require deliberate policy and institutional innovation. Additionally, the way we measure economic progress must adapt to accurately capture the contributions of AI and intangibles. This section outlines key reforms in two categories: (1) policies to distribute and democratize productivity gains , and (2) improvements to statistical measurements of productivity in the digital age .5354 55 10 Distributing the Gains from Automation To counteract the tendencies of decoupling and rent concentration, new institutional approaches are needed so that a post-labor productivity surge translates into widely shared prosperity. Key strategies include: Inclusive ownership and profit-sharing: Encourage models where workers and the public share in the ownership of the technologies that drive TFP gains. This could involve expanding employee stock-ownership plans in tech firms, or sovereign wealth funds and citizen’s trusts that invest in automation-heavy industries and pay dividends to citizens. By widening capital ownership, the returns from high productivity are more evenly distributed rather than accruing solely to existing capital owners. Education, retraining, and complementarity: Invest heavily in education and continuous skill development so that human workers remain complementary to AI, not substitutes to be replaced. As IMF researchers suggest, focusing on AI complementarity (skills and roles where humans work with AI effectively) can ensure that workers benefit through higher wages and productivity . This might mean curricula emphasizing creativity, critical thinking, and interpersonal skills – areas where humans paired with AI can be extremely productive. Better education also enables developing countries to participate in higher segments of value chains, mitigating global inequality . Strengthening labor institutions and social safety nets: Even in a post-labor economy, labor’s voice matters for how gains are allocated. Unions or new forms of worker associations could bargain for a share of the productivity gains (perhaps in reduced work hours for the same pay, or in negotiating how AI is deployed). Meanwhile, robust social safety nets (unemployment insurance, retraining support, universal basic income or similar programs) can buffer workers through transitions and ensure a minimum income floor . Such policies help maintain aggregate demand and social stability in the face of disruptive automation. Tax and transfer policies: Tax policy will play a crucial role. Some economists have floated the idea of a “robot tax” (taxing companies for replacing workers with machines) to slow automation or fund safety nets. Even if not a robot-specific tax, more progressive taxation on capital income or windfall profits could be used to finance redistribution. For instance, if AI allows certain firms to earn monopoly rents, taxing those excess profits and redistributing them (via cash transfers, expanded public services, etc.) spreads the benefit. Additionally, expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit or wage subsidies can supplement incomes of workers in low-wage sectors that might not see productivity gains. The aim is to prevent a scenario where productivity soars but public revenues lag because of narrow profit concentration. Fair and effective taxation of digital businesses (including international coordination to tax tech giants) is a piece of this puzzle. Competition policy and open innovation: To tackle rent concentration, antitrust enforcement and pro-competition regulation are vital. Preventing AI monopolies and ensuring new entrants can compete will help diffuse innovations and lower prices for consumers. Open science and open- source AI initiatives can likewise spread technological capabilities beyond a few corporations. The OECD calls for measures to promote competition and accessible diffusion of AI – for example, scrutinizing mergers that concentrate AI talent or datasets, mandating data portability and• • 5354 52 • • • 44 11 interoperability, and supporting public or academic AI research. By democratizing the technology, we reduce the risk of all gains funneling to a handful of players. Public provision and price controls in essential sectors: Given the cost-disease problem, government may need to play a stronger role in sectors like healthcare, housing, and education to ensure they don’t become prohibitively expensive relative to incomes. Policies could include greater public options or subsidies (to increase supply and lower price) or productivity initiatives within those sectors (e.g., encouraging AI in medical diagnostics or online education to boost productivity in typically stagnant sectors). If essential-service inflation is tamed, then more of the overall productivity gains translate to real purchasing power for households. Many of these reforms align with ensuring that AI’s benefits are broadly accessible and that any negative impacts (like displacement) are mitigated. For example, the OECD’s policy recommendations stress a comprehensive approach including competition policy, job transition assistance, and inequality reduction . The overarching principle is that technological progress should be managed by institutions so that it remains a positive-sum game . Historically, periods of great productivity advancement (such as the post-WWII decades) coincided with strong institutions for wage bargaining, progressive taxation, and social investment, which together produced rising middle-class incomes and reduced inequality even as technology transformed work. A similar renewal of the social contract is needed for the AI age. Improving TFP and Economic Measurements As discussed earlier , the digital economy and AI challenge traditional economic metrics. It is crucial to reform how we measure productivity and growth to better capture reality: Capitalizing data and AI intangibles: Statistical agencies should extend the boundaries of capital in national accounts to include more intangibles relevant to AI. Just as R&D and software are now treated as capital investments, data (large curated datasets), machine learning models , and other algorithmic assets could be recognized as forms of capital formation. Work by Corrado, Haskel, and others on intangibles supports this broadening of the asset boundary . By doing so, when a company builds a large dataset or trains an AI model, that expenditure would add to GDP (as investment) and increase the measured capital stock. This reduces the residual attributed to TFP and gives a more accurate picture of input growth in the AI era. It also aligns with how businesses view these assets – increasingly, data and AI models are seen as capital that yields services over time. Implementing this will require methods to estimate the monetary value and depreciation of data and algorithms, which is an active area of research. Adjusting price indices for digital services and quality: Many AI-driven services are free or vastly improved in quality (e.g., search engines, translation tools, now generative AI services). Our price indices often struggle with quality adjustment for free or freemium goods. Efforts should be made to incorporate quality adjustments for digital services and to include the consumer surplus from “free” digital goods where appropriate (perhaps via satellite accounts). Similarly, hedonic pricing techniques need continual updating to capture rapid improvements in AI-related hardware. If we undervalue quality improvements (for instance, the fact that today’s smartphones come with AI assistants that did not exist a few years ago, at roughly the same price), we will overstate inflation and understate real output and productivity. Research from Brynjolfsson and others suggests that• 44 • 5657 • 12 the welfare gains from some digital goods are huge but barely reflected in GDP. While GDP has its limits as a welfare measure, we can refine it to better account for the digital sector’s contributions. Utilization and workforce adjustments: As production processes change with AI, measuring labor and capital utilization becomes important. For example, if AI allows flexible 24/7 production with fewer downtime, effective use of capital increases. Fed researchers already produce utilization- adjusted TFP measures to isolate pure tech efficiency . These should be continued and refined for AI (which might raise utilization of machines and also allow higher labor utilization via gig/platform work patterns). Additionally, defining the “labor force” may become tricky if human work hours drop or new forms of work emerge (crowd-sourced micro-tasks, etc.). Measurement may need to incorporate these changes, perhaps by tracking total hours worked including non-traditional arrangements, to avoid overstating productivity per hour simply because some work is not recorded as formal labor . New indicators of well-being and distribution: Given that TFP and GDP averages won’t tell the full story in a post-labor world, statistical systems should develop complementary indicators . For instance, tracking median income growth alongside productivity growth can signal whether gains are broadly shared or not. Likewise, measuring changes in the cost of a basket of essential services (a “cost disease index”) can highlight if essential inflation is eroding gains. Some have proposed a dashboard of metrics beyond GDP: including inequality indices, job quality measures, and even leisure time (if automation allows more free time, that is a benefit not captured in GDP). While these aren’t part of TFP measurement per se, they are crucial to interpreting TFP in terms of human welfare. International coordination on measuring intangibles: To avoid a fragmented approach, global bodies like the OECD, IMF, and World Bank should coordinate on updating the System of National Accounts for the digital era. Efforts are already underway to measure “GDP-B” (GDP including benefits from free goods) and to harmonize how data is treated. An updated framework that explicitly includes intangible digital capital would lead to better international comparisons and a clearer picture of how AI is contributing to growth. This also ties into developing economies – better measures might show that some developing countries are leapfrogging in digital services more than old metrics suggest. Implementing these measurement reforms is technically challenging, but it is crucial. As Brynjolfsson et al. argue, without updating our metrics, we might misinterpret the AI revolution – initially underestimating productivity (as gains hide in unmeasured intangibles) and later overstating it (when returns on those intangibles finally appear) . The goal is to make TFP a more transparent indicator of technology’s impact . For example, if AI leads to huge investments in intangible capital, we want to reflect those as input growth rather than a mysterious residual. This will help policymakers craft informed responses (recognizing, say, that slow measured productivity might be due to heavy intangible investment that will pay off later). Additionally, better measurement can guide better policy: if data is recognized as capital, questions arise about who owns it and how its returns are allocated – linking back to the distributional reforms. In conclusion, the combination of institutional reforms and measurement improvements forms a twin strategy: ensure the economic rules of the game are such that AI-driven productivity translates to human• 26 2 • • 67 13 benefit, and ensure our metrics properly capture what’s happening. The final section concludes with reflections on navigating the post-labor productivity era. Conclusion The rise of automation, AI, and robotics heralds a new chapter in economic growth – one where Total Factor Productivity could accelerate as machines augment or replace human labor on a broad scale. We have seen that TFP, essentially the Solow residual, is fundamentally about technological progress and efficiency gains . In a post-labor paradigm, many of these gains will stem from synthetic labor performing tasks at unprecedented productivity levels, potentially yielding significant output growth from constant or even declining human labor input. This paper has surveyed how such a scenario might play out: on one hand, offering the promise of a productivity renaissance fueled by AI as a general-purpose technology, and on the other hand, posing profound challenges in ensuring those gains lead to widespread improvements in living standards. Key findings include: (1) TFP measures must be interpreted carefully in the AI age , since unmeasured intangible investments and quality changes can distort the residual . Proper accounting can reveal the true contributions of automation to growth. (2) Automation can drive TFP up via task efficiency and possibly faster innovation , but the magnitude observed so far is modest, with forecasts ranging from cautious (0.3–0.6 pp annual boosts in advanced economies ) to optimistic (over 1 pp in ideal scenarios ). (3) A surge in TFP does not automatically equate to broad welfare gains – indeed, recent decades warn of productivity–pay decoupling , increasing inequality through concentrated tech rents, and limits from cost-disease sectors . Without intervention, a post-labor economy could exacerbate disparities even as it produces more than ever . (4) Developing countries face the risk that automation undercuts their traditional development ladder; they will need adaptive strategies to harness technology for growth without leaving their labor force behind . (5) To navigate these challenges, a suite of policy reforms (from education to tax to competition) is needed to distribute gains, alongside measurement reforms so we know what gains are being achieved and who is benefiting . The path forward requires a holistic approach. Technological change is not destiny; its impacts depend on the choices societies make. By updating our economic institutions – much as was done during past industrial revolutions with public education, antitrust laws, social security, etc. – we can aim for a future where AI-driven productivity improvements raise all incomes and improve quality of life . Likewise, by improving how we track productivity and growth, we ensure we are aiming at the right targets and recognizing progress when it happens. Total Factor Productivity will remain a vital indicator in the post- labor era, but it must be supplemented with new lenses to see the full picture. In the end, the goal is to achieve what Robert Solow envisioned as the essence of productivity: getting more output from the same or less input – doing more with less . AI and automation epitomize this idea, potentially enabling abundance. Whether that abundance is shared – that is the grand question. With prudent reforms, there is hope that a high-TFP post-labor economy can deliver inclusive prosperity , not just impressive production statistics. As we stand on the frontier of this new economic age, the decisions we make now will determine if Total Factor Productivity becomes a rising tide that truly lifts all boats or if it merely swells the yachts while leaving many anchored in place. The stakes could not be higher , and the opportunity not greater , to harness technological progress for the common good.13 611 32 42 43 22 4849 4413 1 14 Sources: RSM US, “Solow residual: Total factor productivity and the U.S. economy,” April 2024 – discussion of TFP measurement and recent trends .
