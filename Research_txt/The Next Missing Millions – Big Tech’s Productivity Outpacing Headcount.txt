The Next Missing Millions – Big Tech’s Productivity Outpacing Headcount Introduction Economist David Autor has highlighted the paradox of “missing millions” of workers – people who, in past eras, might have shifted into new jobs as technology advanced, but in recent decades have instead left the workforce. In the early 21st century, we are seeing a similar phenomenon play out in the tech industry: Big Tech companies are achieving enormous growth in output and value with relatively modest increases in headcount . Automation, software scalability, and network effects have allowed tech giants to dramatically boost productivity per employee , foreshadowing a “next missing millions” trend in which many jobs that might have existed in a more labor-intensive economy simply aren’t there . This report compiles empirical data from the early 2000s to the present to demonstrate how Big Tech’s productivity is zooming ahead of hiring – and why this trend shows no signs of reversing. To set the stage, consider a few striking examples that underscore how tech firms can generate massive value with surprisingly few workers : Google vs. General Motors: In 2012, Google earned about $14 billion in profit with 38,000 employees, whereas General Motors in 1979 earned $11 billion with 840,000 employees . In other words, Google produced similar financial output with less than 5% of the workforce GM once required – an early hint of a growing productivity gap. YouTube (2006): When Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in 2006, the video platform had just 65 employees , equating to roughly $25 million in value per employee . Instagram (2012): Facebook’s purchase of Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 famously came when Instagram had only 13 employees – about $77 million in value per employee . WhatsApp (2014): Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion was even more staggering: WhatsApp had 55 employees , implying roughly $345 million of valuation per employee . These examples, while extraordinary, illustrate a broader pattern. Today’s tech giants – from Silicon Valley to China – can leverage software, automation, and global digital markets to scale up revenues and market value with far fewer workers than industrial-era companies needed . In the following sections, we delve into the data showing Big Tech’s surging output versus relatively tepid headcount growth, examine how revenue per employee has skyrocketed, and discuss the role of automation in this divergence. We also address counter-arguments and implications – including whether these “missing” jobs might appear elsewhere or if this trend might slow – and show why current evidence suggests the gap between productivity and employment is unlikely to close soon.• 1 • 1 • 1 • 1 1 Big Tech’s Booming Output vs. Modest Headcount Growth Major technology companies have experienced explosive growth in revenues (and profits) over the last two decades, but their employee counts have grown much more slowly . In other words, output has far outpaced hiring . A simple metric to illustrate this is revenue per employee (RPE) – how much annual revenue a company generates per worker . By this measure, Big Tech firms are in a league of their own, and their lead is increasing over time. To start, consider the current RPE of some of the world’s largest tech companies. In 2022, many tech giants generated well over a million dollars of revenue per employee : Revenue per employee at major tech companies (2022). Each employee at Apple generated about $2.4 million in annual revenue in 2022, and at Google (Alphabet) about $1.48 million. Even companies like Meta (Facebook) and Microsoft earned over $1 million per employee, while China’s Tencent averaged ~$0.73 million. Amazon, with its more labor-intensive operations, was lower at ~$0.33 million per worker . These figures underscore the extreme productivity of Big Tech’s workforce. As shown above, Apple Inc. led the pack with roughly $2.4 million in revenue per employee in 2022, up from about $1.9 million in 2020 . Alphabet (Google) wasn’t far behind at approximately $1.5 million per employee, and Meta (Facebook) around $1.35 million . Even software-centric firms like Microsoft (nearly $0.96M per employee) or high-margin internet companies like Netflix (~$2.47M per employee) far exceeded traditional firms on this metric . Chinese tech giants also show strong productivity: Tencent averaged about $0.73M and Alibaba ~$0.54M per employee – lower than U.S. peers, yet still an order of magnitude above old industrial norms. By contrast, Amazon.com , which employs over 1½ million workers including many in warehouses and logistics, had about $333k revenue per employee – high for retail, but relatively low for tech, reflecting Amazon’s more labor-intensive e-commerce and fulfillment operations alongside its automated cloud services. What’s truly telling is how rapidly these productivity metrics have risen . Apple’s trajectory is illustrative. Between 2010 and 2020, Apple’s annual revenue grew more than fourfold, yet its workforce did not even double – boosting revenue-per-employee from roughly $1.3M to $1.9M . By 2022, Apple’s RPE had climbed to about $2.4M . In fact, Apple’s total revenue hit $394 billion in 2022 with about 164,000 employees, compared to just $8 billion revenue in 2000 with ~8,600 employees . That means in roughly two decades, Apple’s revenue grew almost 50× while its headcount grew only 19× – a clear sign that each employee is contributing far more output now than in the past. This pattern isn’t unique to Apple. Google (Alphabet) went from about $19 billion revenue in 2008 with ~20,000 employees, to $282 billion in 2022 with ~190,000 employees – roughly a 15× increase in revenue against a 9× increase in staff, lifting RPE over time (despite a recent hiring spree) to around $1.5M . Meta (Facebook) , starting from near zero in 2004, reached $117 billion revenue in 2021 with ~72,000 employees (well over $1.5M per employee), before a slight dip in 2022. Microsoft , a longer-established firm, has also seen revenue grow faster than headcount: between 2000 and 2022, Microsoft’s annual revenue roughly octupled (from ~$23B to ~$198B) while its employee count rose about fivefold (from ~39k to ~181k), resulting in higher output per worker (approaching $1 million today). Perhaps more striking is how the tech sector as a whole has pulled away from other industries in productivity . Over the past two decades, the average revenue per employee in the technology industry23 4 2 2 5 6 7 4 89 10 2 jumped from about $300k in 2000 to roughly $2.4 million in 2024 – an eightfold increase . This is far above the growth seen in other sectors. Financial services, for example, rose from roughly $250k to $700k in RPE over the same period, and industrial firms from about $150k to $350k . Even retail – traditionally very labor-intensive and low in RPE – climbed from ~$80k to ~$250k per employee on average, thanks to e- commerce and automation, but still remains an order of magnitude below tech . The chart below compares these trends: Revenue per employee in the tech sector vs. other industries, 2000 vs. 2024. Twenty years ago, tech firms already had higher output per worker than finance, industrials, or retail, but the gap was modest. By 2024, tech’s average revenue per employee (~$2.4M) dwarfed that of finance (~$0.7M), industrials (~$0.35M), and retail (~$0.25M) . This reflects the scalability of digital businesses and extensive automation. As the data illustrate, Big Tech’s productivity (output per worker) has skyrocketed in the 21st century, leaving other sectors behind. Technology companies today can reach billions of users or manage vast operations with surprisingly lean teams. Software platforms and online services can be replicated and distributed at near-zero marginal cost – you don’t need a new worker for every new customer in the way a factory or store might. This scalability is a key reason revenue can grow much faster than payrolls. Moreover , automation and AI have enabled efficiency gains internally . Tech firms aggressively automate routine tasks in their operations (from data center management to advertising sales optimization), so each employee can oversee far more activity. Even in manufacturing or logistics, where tech companies operate (e.g. assembling iPhones or running warehouses), increasing use of robots, software, and process engineering has raised output per worker . For instance, Apple has optimized its supply chain and relies on outsourced manufacturing; it can sell a far greater volume of products without proportional in-house labor . And in software and internet businesses, one engineer’s work (writing code or managing systems) can effectively serve millions of customers once deployed. In short, Big Tech is achieving what many economists call “labor-light” growth – lots of output, not so many workers . This is the essence of the “next missing millions” thesis: if, in earlier times, a booming new industry (like autos or steel) would absorb hundreds of thousands of workers, today’s booming industries simply don’t employ as many people relative to their size. The millions of jobs we might expect to accompany trillion-dollar companies are nowhere to be found – instead, a relatively small cadre of highly skilled employees, leveraging technology and automation, is generating unprecedented levels of revenue. The Rise of Revenue-Per-Employee and the Automation Link The concept of “revenue per employee” (RPE) has become a focal point for understanding this dynamic. It quantifies the average productivity of workers in dollar terms. A rising RPE means a company is “doing more with less” – either producing more output with the same number of people or maintaining output with fewer people. In Big Tech, RPE has not only risen, it has soared . This is directly tied to the nature of tech businesses and their use of automation.11 12 13 11 13 14 3 Several factors drive tech’s outsized RPE: Scalable Business Models: Many tech giants operate platforms or software services (e.g. search, social media, cloud computing) that can grow revenue without a linear growth in staff. For example, Google’s and Facebook’s advertising-driven models generate more sales as user activity increases, but this doesn’t require one-to-one hiring of new workers – their systems handle the extra load. Companies like Facebook and Google thus “maintain high RPE due to business models that scale without proportional labor increases.” Once the infrastructure and software are in place, serving an additional million customers might only need a handful of extra engineers or support staff, if that. This is fundamentally different from say, a factory, which would need to hire more workers to produce more goods. Automation of Tasks: Automation is a key lever of productivity. Repetitive or low-value tasks that might have required staff can often be handled by algorithms, machines, or self-service processes. Tech companies are at the cutting edge of deploying such automation. As one analysis succinctly concludes, “the more automation an organization has, the steeper (better) their productivity curves – they squeeze more from the same workforce.” Cloud data centers, for instance, can be managed with minimal technicians because of automated monitoring and management software. Customer service can be augmented with AI chatbots. Data analytics that would require large teams can be done with smart software. All this means fewer employees are needed to achieve a given level of output . High Specialization and Skill: Tech workers tend to be highly skilled (engineers, developers, etc.) and supported by powerful tools, so their output is amplified. In essence, each worker is empowered to produce more value. This specialization – often around creating or managing IP (intellectual property) like software – contributes to higher RPE even among peers; for example, within tech, companies focused on pure software or IP (like a NVIDIA or a Netflix) often show even higher RPE than those with more people-intensive segments . Global Reach and Network Effects: A single tech platform can serve a global market. This means a small team can capture revenue from worldwide users or customers. Network effects (where the product becomes more valuable as more people use it, with little added labor cost) allow explosive revenue growth without equivalent hiring. For instance, WhatsApp’s 55 employees built a product that serviced hundreds of millions of users – far more users per employee than any traditional service could handle – hence its extreme value per head when acquired . The aggregate result of these factors is visible in the earlier data: tech firms vastly outpace other industries in revenue per worker , and they have increased that lead over time. Even during the late 2010s and early 2020s when tech companies went on a hiring binge (often in anticipation of continued growth), many still improved their RPE. For example, between 2018 and 2022, Apple, Microsoft, and Salesforce were among the few big tech firms that managed to increase revenue per employee while also increasing headcount . This indicates they achieved growth through efficiency gains and new high-margin revenue streams (like Apple’s services or Microsoft’s cloud software) rather than just adding bodies. Some firms did see RPE dip when they over-expanded staff – an issue that came to a head in 2022. Companies like Amazon, Meta, and Twitter dramatically grew their workforces from 2018–2022 (Amazon went from ~647k to 1.5 million employees in five years), but their revenue per employee actually fell during• 15 • 16 • 17 • 1 18 4 that period (Amazon’s dropped ~7% to $333k; Meta’s fell 14%) . This “productivity drag” from rapid hiring led to a wave of belt-tightening in 2022–2023. Big Tech CEOs openly acknowledged they had overshot. “Many people predicted [the pandemic boom] would be permanent... I did too, so I increased our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out,” admitted Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg in late 2022 as he announced layoffs . In response, companies pivoted to what Zuckerberg called “a year of efficiency,” aiming to trim staff and refocus on productivity. Investors also pushed this narrative. Prominent tech investor Keith Rabois argued that Silicon Valley’s giants had become “bloated and unproductive,” and he called for a focus on one metric in particular: revenue per employee . In essence, the market began demanding a return to the lean, high-RPE model. Consequently, by 2023 many firms were shedding roles that didn’t clearly contribute to output, effectively doubling down on the goal of rising productivity per head . This recent correction actually reinforces the long-term trend: Big Tech is intent on increasing output with as little workforce expansion as necessary. After a brief period of arguably excessive hiring, the trajectory – more automation, more efficiency, and relatively fewer workers – has resumed. Apple, notably, avoided heavy layoffs because it never over-expanded and its RPE remained stellar throughout . Others, like Meta, cut thousands of jobs and then saw their RPE metrics improve as revenues recovered. In short, the drive toward higher revenue-per-employee is now an explicit management goal in the industry. Early Signs of a "Missing Millions" Phenomenon The term “missing millions” refers to the puzzling absence of millions of workers from employment, even as technology and the economy advance. David Autor and other economists observed that in recent decades, especially since 2000, labor force participation fell and job growth lagged output , suggesting that many workers who might have been employed in a different era were not finding jobs in the new one. Automation and offshoring eliminated certain mid-level jobs (e.g. in manufacturing), and unlike past technological revolutions, the economy did not create enough new jobs of equivalent scale to absorb those displaced. The result was “jobless growth” – productivity rose, GDP rose, but employment did not keep up, leaving a gap filled by those “missing” workers. Autor’s research finds that since about 1980, technology has indeed displaced more jobs than it has created , a reversal of the previous pattern . In fact, the negative impact of automation on employment was more than twice as large in 1980–2018 as in 1940–1980 – meaning recent technological change has been far less job-creating (or far more job-eliminating) than earlier waves. The trends in Big Tech can be viewed as a microcosm of this broader phenomenon . These companies are at the cutting edge of automation and digital innovation, so it stands to reason that their employment patterns might foreshadow what happens in the wider economy. So far , the evidence indeed points that way: Enormous Market Caps, Relatively Few Workers: The five largest U.S. tech firms (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta) together have a market capitalization in the trillions of dollars and combined annual revenues well over $1.2 trillion, yet together directly employ on the order of 2–3 million people (with Amazon’s warehouse-heavy workforce constituting over half of that). By contrast, in 1979 just the U.S. manufacturing sector employed nearly 19 million people for roughly comparable total output in today’s dollars . In other words, the economy can now generate the same output with an order of magnitude fewer workers , concentrated in highly productive firms.19 20 21 22 23 24 • 2526 5 “Missing” Tech Jobs: If tech companies in 2025 operated at the productivity levels of say, 1980, they would likely need tens of millions of employees to achieve their current output – a scenario clearly at odds with reality. For example, at around $2 million revenue per employee, Apple’s 164k staff generate $391B. Had Apple’s productivity remained at its 1980s levels, millions of workers would be needed to hit that revenue (or conversely, Apple’s current workforce could only produce a small fraction of its revenue). Those extra jobs simply don’t exist – they are the “missing” jobs attributable to efficiency gains. Comparison to Traditional Giants: The earlier Google versus GM comparison illustrates how few jobs the digital era requires relative to the old industrial era . GM in its heyday provided stable middle- class employment to hundreds of thousands of people (assembly line workers, support staff, etc.), while Google (and other tech firms) provide far fewer such opportunities even as they generate equal or greater value . The opportunities that do exist in tech are often for highly educated engineers and professionals. This contributes to the polarization Autor describes – high-skill jobs grow and low-skill service jobs grow, but many middle-skill jobs vanish . Global but Not Labor-Intensive: Many Big Tech products effectively serve as infrastructure for the world economy (search engines, social networks, e-commerce platforms, etc.), analogous to railroads or electric grids in the past. But where building and running a railroad network or utility employed armies of workers, building and running a digital platform does not. The “armies” of the tech era are server farms and algorithms. When technology allows one worker (or a small team) to do what used to require 100, the jobs of the other 99 are simply not needed in that domain. Of course, an important counterpoint is that some jobs do get created in new domains. For instance, the app economy, gig economy, and IT services are areas where tech indirectly spurred employment. Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android platforms gave rise to millions of app developer and software company jobs; Amazon’s e-commerce platform supports many third-party sellers and delivery jobs. However , many of those jobs are different in nature (often contract-based, lower paid, or requiring different skills), and they often don’t equal the number of jobs lost or foregone . The net effect, as data suggests, has been that technology’s job creation has not kept pace with its job destruction in recent decades . In Big Tech specifically, even as these firms enable new ecosystems of work, they themselves capture a huge share of economic value without commensurate direct employment . The wealth concentrates in the companies (and their relatively small workforces), rather than being broadly spread via large payrolls. Furthermore, many tech companies rely on extensive outsourcing and contractor arrangements , which can obscure the real labor footprint but also highlight how different the employment model is. For example, Apple contracts with manufacturing firms like Foxconn that employ over a million workers – but those workers are not counted in Apple’s employee rolls. One might argue that those jobs do exist (so perhaps the work isn’t truly “missing”) – but critically, they often exist in lower-cost countries, and automation is increasingly reducing the need for them as well (Foxconn itself has automated many facilities). Similarly, Google and Facebook employ thousands of content moderators, drivers, and support staff via third-party firms or gig platforms. These arrangements shift a lot of labor to peripheral status – workers are not in-house, often have lower pay/benefits, and the companies can scale them up or down flexibly. This trend indicates that where jobs are needed, companies try to keep them at arm’s length or make them temporary, again maximizing output per direct employee.• • 1 2728 • 2324 6 All these pieces paint a picture consistent with a “missing millions” scenario in the making. We are not yet at a point where tens of millions of jobs have vanished outright due to Big Tech – after all, unemployment in many countries is currently low. But we are seeing a world where massive economic value is being created with relatively trivial labor input . In the long run, if other industries adopt similar technologies (AI, automation, platform-based models), we could witness broader job-sparse growth. As one recent MIT study notes, there is no economic law guaranteeing that job creation will automatically match job automation – and indeed it hasn’t in the last 40 years . Notably, the pandemic accelerated investment in automation (as firms sought to reduce reliance on human labor for resilience), and now the rise of artificial intelligence is poised to further boost productivity. Big Tech is heavily investing in AI to automate everything from customer service to software coding. These are early days for AI deployment, but the direction is clear . Analysts have even begun dubbing AI “the last employee” , suggesting future companies might generate revenue with minimal human workforce by leveraging AI tools . While that is speculative, it aligns with the productivity-over-jobs path Big Tech is already on. No Signs of Reversal – Addressing Counter-Arguments Could this trend of soaring productivity and relatively stagnant employment reverse or slow down? As of now, there are no clear signs of a reversal – if anything, current evidence points toward further entrenchment of these patterns. Let’s address a few counter-arguments and common questions: 1. “Maybe this is just a tech-sector quirk – elsewhere jobs are growing.” It’s true that Big Tech is unique in its ability to scale with few workers. Other sectors (healthcare, hospitality, education, etc.) still require lots of human labor and have seen job growth. However , the concern is that tech’s model will spread . As AI and software penetrate other industries, they could enable similar labor-light growth in sectors that historically employed millions. For instance, automated checkout systems in retail or AI diagnostic tools in medicine could cap employment needs even as those services expand. Moreover , Big Tech’s dominance itself can suppress job growth in adjacent industries – e.g. when Amazon automates logistics, it affects the entire warehousing job market, or when Google’s algorithms replace traditional advertising work, that reduces jobs in marketing and media. The economy-wide labor force participation in many advanced countries remains below its late-20th-century peaks, suggesting that the slack created by high-productivity sectors hasn’t been fully absorbed by labor-intensive sectors . In the U.S., prime-age male workforce participation, for example, has drifted downward for decades – a sign that many who might have worked in an earlier era’s industries are not all finding new jobs now. 2. “Don’t tech companies create jobs indirectly (apps, gig economy, etc.)?” Yes, they do create some ancillary jobs. The app development industry, rideshare drivers, e-commerce sellers, and IT consulting are all areas boosted by the tech platforms. These are important, but many of these roles are often smaller in scale or less stable than the traditional jobs lost. A gig driver is an independent contractor , not a full-time employee with benefits; an app startup might employ a dozen developers, not hundreds. So while new jobs emerge, they often don’t require as many people as the old ones (or they are not as secure or well-paid). The net outcome, as data and research indicate, is still that technology has been a net job displacer in recent decades . We should also note that indirect job creation can be global – a platform might enable a freelancer in another country – which is good for that individual but doesn’t necessarily help regain the domestic jobs lost. In short, the jobs created around Big Tech tend to be a fraction of the value generated.29 3031 23 7 The lion’s share of value accrues without corresponding labor – which is why we see such high revenue and profits per employee. 3. “Low unemployment today seems to contradict the ‘missing jobs’ idea.” Unemployment rates in the U.S. and some other countries have been very low recently (in 2023 the U.S. hit ~50-year low unemployment). However , the unemployment rate only counts people actively seeking work. It doesn’t count those who left the labor force entirely. The employment-to-population ratio and labor force participation tell a different story – they remain below historical highs, meaning a portion of would-be workers are “missing” in that they’re neither working nor counted as unemployed. Some of this is due to retirements or other social factors, but economists like Autor point to the long-term drop in demand for certain workers (especially non-college-educated men) due to automation and globalization as a major factor . These folks didn’t all transition into new tech jobs; many ended up economically inactive or in much lower-paying work. So the missing millions may be hidden behind statistics , but they are real. 4. “Maybe the trend will self-correct – new industries will arise to employ people.” It’s possible that entirely new sectors (think of something like the renewable energy industry or space exploration or biotech) could generate a wave of employment. History has examples – the rise of the service economy in the 20th century absorbed those who left agriculture and manufacturing. The open question is whether future innovations will need humans at scale, or if machines will do much of the work . The current direction of tech – AI, robotics, software – suggests a bias toward labor-saving innovations rather than labor-creating ones. Autor’s study found that from 1940–1980, new tasks (augmentation) did create many jobs, but from 1980 onward, that pace slowed while automation accelerated . We can’t rule out a breakthrough that suddenly demands millions of human workers (for example, a massive infrastructure project or care economy expansion), but nothing on the horizon seems likely to fully counteract the efficiency gains being achieved. In fact, many new industries (like digital content creation, AI development, etc.) are also not labor- heavy in the way manufacturing or construction were. Big Tech themselves are investing heavily in ensuring future growth comes from technology, not large human teams – e.g., Google and Microsoft investing in AI that can write code, which could reduce the need for as many programmers in the long run. 5. “Aren’t there limits to productivity growth per employee?” There might be practical limits, and indeed some companies can hit diminishing returns on RPE once they’ve optimized everything. Apple, for instance, saw its RPE growth slow in the early 2020s – it went from $1.9M to $2.4M per employee between 2020 and 2022 , a healthy jump but not as dramatic as earlier decades. This was partly because even highly efficient firms encounter some constraints (e.g. retail Apple Store staff and hardware assembly still scale with volume to a degree). However , even if the rate of increase moderates, the level of RPE is so high now that maintaining it means any growth doesn’t need a lot of hiring. And new technology can always provide another bump – AI could enable another leap in RPE by taking over white-collar tasks. It’s also notable that when companies reach a productivity plateau, they often turn to cost-cutting (layoffs) or new tech to push it higher again (as seen in 2022–2023). The competitive nature of the industry reinforces this – if one company finds a way to do the same work with fewer people, others feel pressure to follow. In summary, the evidence strongly suggests that the trend of Big Tech (and similar firms) achieving outsized productivity with relatively few employees is here to stay – and likely to intensify . Automation and digital scalability are not reversing; they’re advancing. While new jobs will be created, they are unlikely to fully bridge the gap. Policymakers and society may need to adjust to an era where economic value creation is less tied to job creation than in the past. This could mean rethinking social safety nets, education (to prepare people for the high-skill jobs that do exist), or even concepts like shortened work2728 24 4 8 weeks or universal basic income – ideas that gain traction when productivity rises but employment doesn’t keep up. For now, the “next missing millions” are not just a theoretical future concern – the early signs are visible in every graph of soaring revenue-per-employee and every story of a multi-billion-dollar startup with a skeleton crew. The challenge and opportunity ahead will be figuring out how to spread the wealth of this high-productivity economy even as the traditional route – a job – becomes a less reliable way to participate in the gains. What is clear from the data is that Big Tech’s productivity boom shows no sign of abating, even as its headcount growth slows . The playbook of the digital age is set: use technology to multiply output, not workers . And unless something dramatic changes, that playbook will continue to deliver remarkable efficiency – and a labor market conundrum – in the years to come.
