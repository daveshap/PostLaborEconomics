Macroeconomics and Boundary Conditions: The Edges of Post-Labor Economic Theory Introduction Advances in artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation are challenging one of the fundamental assumptions of modern economics: that human labor is the central engine of production and income. Post- Labor Economic Theory explores scenarios in which human labor demand structurally declines as machines increasingly perform work across industries. In such a “post-work” or “post-labor” economy, the link between jobs and livelihoods could be severed at scale. This prospect raises profound macroeconomic, social, and ecological questions. How will income be generated and distributed if wages cease to be the primary mechanism? What happens to consumption, inflation, and monetary policy when a large share of the population is supported by non-labor income or public dividends instead of paychecks? Can our financial and policy institutions – from sovereign wealth funds to central banks – be retooled to stabilize an economy no longer centered on full employment? And crucially, what are the material and geopolitical boundary conditions of this vision, from resource constraints of automation to global capital flows and social stratification? These questions define the edges of post-labor economic theory, where multiple disciplines converge to examine an unprecedented economic paradigm. This paper synthesizes insights from orthodox macroeconomics, heterodox political economy, ecological economics, and international political economy to map the current understanding of a post-labor economy and identify its unresolved tensions. We draw on foundational texts as well as the latest literature to explore six key themes: (1) the macroeconomic implications of shifting from wage-based to dividend-based income distributions (effects on consumption, inflation, and monetary policy); (2) the role of public wealth funds, sovereign balance sheets, and central bank architecture in a post-labor system; (3) the material throughput constraints of automation beyond just energy, incorporating input-output models, circular economy principles, and critical minerals; (4) the geopolitical repercussions of post-labor transitions, including capital flight, monetary blocs, and trade realignments; (5) intersectional disparities in automation risk and economic agency across class, race, gender , and migration status; and (6) needed adaptations in macroeconomic theory to account for automation-driven declines in labor demand and new forms of collective economic agency. Throughout, we highlight points of convergence and divergence among different schools of thought – for instance, where mainstream economic models agree with or contradict heterodox and ecological perspectives – and emphasize areas requiring theoretical innovation or empirical verification. Footnote citations are provided for key claims and evidence, and a comprehensive bibliography of sources is included. By surveying these “boundary conditions” at the edge of current economic thought, we aim to chart a more coherent research agenda for the post-labor economy and clarify the choices facing policymakers in the coming decades. 1 From Wages to Dividends: Macroeconomic Implications of Income Distribution Shifts A defining feature of a post-labor economy is that a growing share of national income accrues not to workers via wages, but to owners of capital via profits, rents, and dividends. This shift is already observable in declining labor share trends globally: in 13 of the world’s 16 largest economies, labor’s share of income has fallen markedly in recent decades. In the United States, for example, the labor share in the nonfarm business sector dropped from around 64% in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century to about 57% in the 21<sup>st</sup>, a historically low level. Research attributes this decline partly to automation – capital substituting for labor in an expanding range of tasks – and partly to market concentration and higher mark-ups in the digital economy. In essence, technological change and winner-take-all market dynamics are funneling more income to owners of robots, algorithms, and intellectual property, while diminishing the relative share going to workers. Consumption and Demand: A critical macroeconomic question is how aggregate demand can be sustained if wage incomes stagnate or decline for a large portion of the population. Wage earners typically have a higher marginal propensity to consume than wealthy asset owners, so a shift toward dividend or capital income could depress consumption unless offset by broad redistribution. Heterodox macroeconomic models (e.g. neo-Kaleckian or Post-Keynesian models) have long examined “wage-led” vs. “profit-led” demand regimes. In a post-labor scenario, where profits dominate, a pure profit-led regime risks chronic demand deficiency: if too few people have disposable income, consumption falters and even capitalists may find insufficient demand for their output, dampening investment incentives. Indeed, Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018) note a feedback loop whereby extreme automation can erode labor incomes so much that it circles back to slow growth – a form of underconsumption crisis. To avoid this, many theorists argue that dividend-based or public income streams must replace wages in supporting consumer spending. If every citizen receives a social dividend (for example, a universal basic income funded by automation gains), then mass purchasing power can be maintained even as traditional employment shrinks. This would effectively make consumption less dependent on having a job, decoupling demand from labor market status. Notably, during the COVID-19 crisis, some countries experimented with broad income transfers decoupled from work – e.g. stimulus checks or furlough payments. Empirical analysis found that these transfers propped up consumption without causing large declines in work effort in the short run. Such evidence tentatively suggests that, at least temporarily, giving people income “irrespective of work” can stabilize demand and does not inevitably collapse the work ethic. However , long-term effects remain uncertain and likely depend on social norms and policies accompanying the transition. Inflation Dynamics: The shift from wage-based to dividend-based incomes could alter inflationary dynamics in complex ways. In today’s economies, wage growth and unit labor costs are key drivers of underlying inflation (via the Phillips curve mechanism). In a post-labor economy, however , wage pressures might play a diminished role. On one hand, extensive automation may exert deflationary forces on many goods and services, as machines increase productivity and reduce production costs. Indeed, as basic goods become cheaper to produce, prices could fall or stagnate – a theme in some techno-utopian visions where automation leads to an abundance of low-cost goods (even approaching “zero marginal cost” for digital products). Historical analogies exist in agriculture: mechanization drastically lowered food prices over the 20<sup>th</sup> century as productivity soared. On the other hand, if consumers’ purchasing power is sustained by public dividends or transfers, demand-pull inflation could emerge especially in sectors that remain supply-constrained. For instance, if everyone has a basic income enabling them to consume but 2 productive capacity in certain essentials (housing, healthcare, etc.) is inelastic, prices in those sectors might rise. Another inflationary risk is “profit-push” inflation : if market power is concentrated among the owners of automation technology, they may set high mark-ups, effectively transferring income from consumers to monopolists and potentially driving up the price level even without wage pressures. We are already witnessing how digital platform monopolies can impose tolls on commerce; a fully automated economy dominated by a few firms could see pricing driven by rent-extraction rather than competitive wages. The net effect on inflation in a post-labor scenario is thus ambiguous and highly regime-dependent. Some scholars argue that a generous universal basic income (UBI) would be mildly inflationary unless matched by equivalent growth in output. Essentially, if “too much money chases too few goods” after a large income injection, prices rise. However , if automation simultaneously boosts output capacity and if UBI is funded by productivity gains (rather than pure money printing), the inflationary impact could be modest. One modeling study found that a budget-neutral UBI in the U.S. (funded by taxes) would increase output and lower inequality, with only a transitory rise in the price level. Still, the design matters: an unfunded UBI (monetized by the central bank) might induce more inflation than a tax-funded or dividend-funded UBI. Monetary policy transmission would also likely change. In a wage-driven economy, raising interest rates cools inflation partly by softening labor markets (less hiring, slower wage growth). In a post-labor economy, that channel weakens; with fewer people employed or bargaining for higher pay, central banks lose their usual leverage over wages. Instead, policy rates might influence inflation more through asset prices and wealth effects (since more income comes from capital): for example, raising rates could reduce dividend payouts and capital gains, tightening consumer spending by “shareholder-consumers.” Conversely, with widespread basic incomes, households’ spending may be less sensitive to interest rate changes and more sensitive to fiscal decisions. Some economists suggest that managing inflation in a post-labor world might require closer coordination of fiscal and monetary tools. If central banks cannot rely on inducing unemployment to control prices (as unemployment may remain persistently high or ill-defined in a post- work society), alternative anchors such as consumption taxes or price controls on key goods might be considered to complement monetary policy. In summary, the disappearance of the traditional wage-price spiral could mean a lower natural rate of inflation (even a deflationary bias from tech efficiency), but also new inflation risks from oligopolistic pricing and broad-based income injections. Macroeconomic theory is only beginning to grapple with these possibilities, underscoring a need for novel models of inflation that decouple it from the labor market equilibrium. Monetary Policy and Financial Stability: In the post-2008 era, central banks have already expanded their toolkit (quantitative easing, direct asset purchases) to stimulate economies amid low labor demand. A post- labor economy could push this evolution further . If private investment languishes due to abundant robotic capacity and sluggish demand, the economy may face secular stagnation – chronic low interest rates and below-potential output. Some mainstream economists like Larry Summers have warned of such scenarios even without full automation. One can imagine a future where central banks, in addition to targeting price stability, are tasked with injecting spending power directly to households (so-called “helicopter money” or direct digital currency transfers) to close demand gaps. Indeed, the advent of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could enable programmable monetary-fiscal policies , such as monthly CBDC credits to every citizen as a form of UBI. This blurs the line between fiscal redistribution and monetary policy. Some have suggested this as a way to provide a stable income floor and manage inflation by modulating the payment size in real-time (a concept hinted by proposals for algorithmic adjustment of UBI based on economic conditions). Such integration, however , challenges the orthodox principle of central bank independence and anti-inflation credibility. It raises governance questions: How to prevent politicization of the money supply? What rules would guide a central-bank-run basic income scheme to avoid hyperinflation or inequity? These 3 remain largely speculative, but they underscore that in a post-labor economy, monetary policy’s traditional transmission channels would be fundamentally altered . The central bank might become more like a giant public wealth fund manager and less like a lender of last resort for banks. Additionally, financial stability concerns could grow if inequality soars: with fewer safe assets (labor income streams) and more reliance on capital gains, asset price bubbles could form easily under easy monetary conditions, then crash and undermine the income of the masses. Preventing such instability might require new macroprudential regulations or even direct public ownership of key financial assets to smooth the boom-bust cycles. In summary, transitioning from a wage-based to a dividend-based distribution system forces a re- examination of core macroeconomic mechanisms. Ensuring adequate consumption likely demands substantial redistribution (through UBI, social dividends, or public jobs) to avert demand shortfalls. Inflation control may shift from managing wage-price spirals to managing wealth effects and monopoly pricing, potentially requiring innovative policy tools. Monetary policy would need to coordinate closely with fiscal authorities or even reinvent itself to support an economy where “full employment” is no longer a meaningful goal. These implications are at the cutting edge of macroeconomic research, and while partial models exist (e.g. general equilibrium simulations of automation with and without redistribution), much remains unresolved. Notably, the proper scale and design of a basic income or dividend system is debated: some argue it must be large enough to replace wages, yet that raises questions of financing and work incentives; others suggest a combination of basic income with job guarantees or targeted services might balance efficiency and equity. This segues into the next section: what institutional architectures could deliver such broad-based dividends and maintain stability in a post-labor economy? Public Wealth Funds, Sovereign Balance Sheets, and the Post-Labor State The prospect of a post-labor economy has renewed interest in transforming public finance and ownership structures. If private capital ownership becomes the primary source of wealth, one way to prevent extreme inequality is for the public itself to own a significant share of capital – effectively socializing part of the automated economy’s returns. This idea spans proposals for social wealth funds , enhanced sovereign wealth funds, and new roles for central banks on sovereign balance sheets. The common thread is to design institutions that collect and redistribute the fruits of automation to citizens as a whole, thereby stabilizing the economy and sharing prosperity. Social Wealth Funds and Dividends: A frequently cited example of broad-based capital income is Alaska’s Permanent Fund Dividend. Since the 1980s, Alaska has channeled oil royalties into a sovereign fund and paid out equal annual dividends to all residents. While modest (typically in the range of \$1,000–\$2,000 per person annually), the Alaska dividend has measurably reduced poverty and given the public a direct stake in commonly owned wealth. Importantly, it demonstrated that a universal basic dividend is administratively feasible and politically popular when funded from a clear resource source. However , Alaska’s experience also highlights challenges: the dividend fluctuates with oil prices, exposing recipients to commodity market volatility. This underlines the need for sustainability and diversification in any public wealth fund that would finance a basic income. In a post-labor context, the analogy would be a Public Automation Fund (or “Commons Capital Fund” as some have called it) fed by taxes or levies on automation-related income – for example, a tax on corporate profits earned by AI and robotics, or even a micro-levy on the use of personal data by tech firms. The revenues would accumulate in a fund that invests broadly, and the returns would pay out as citizen dividends. By tying citizen income to the performance of the automated economy, 4 consumption can be maintained and political support for automation might increase (since everyone has a stake). There are contemporary proposals along these lines: for instance, economist Yanis Varoufakis advocates a “universal basic dividend” where a percentage of all new corporate share issuances goes into a public fund, effectively socializing part of capital growth. Others have suggested that if data is the new oil, then individuals should be paid a “data dividend” for the use of their personal data in AI training – either directly by firms or via a public fund. These mechanisms echo earlier ideas like Thomas Paine’s proposal (in Agrarian Justice , 1797) for a social dividend funded by land value taxes, and more recently the concept of a “stakeholder society” (Ackerman & Alstott 1999) in which every citizen at maturity receives a capital grant or trust fund. The difference in a post-labor framing is the scale: dividends might need to substitute for a majority of labor income, implying a far larger public fund than anything seen historically. Some analyses caution that funding a substantial UBI or dividend purely from taxing capital would require high taxes or very large sovereign wealth holdings. For example, in the U.S. context, even a \$10,000 per year UBI for all adults could easily exceed the entire federal budget if not paired with new revenue sources. Hence, economists explore blended strategies – wealth taxes, land taxes, consumption taxes, data/robot taxes , and public investment returns – to finance a post-labor social contract. Sovereign Wealth Funds and Public Ownership: A number of real-world precedents exist for large sovereign or public wealth funds that could be repurposed or expanded. Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global, now over \$1.3 trillion, originated from oil revenues and is invested globally to fund future public spending (effectively converting finite natural resource wealth into a perpetual financial asset). Some observers suggest analogous funds be built from the “automation windfall” – i.e. governments could require that companies doing mass automation contribute equity or profit-sharing into a public fund. This approach aligns with the idea that much of modern wealth comes from collective inputs (technology, infrastructure, educated workforces) and thus its gains should be partially socialized. Gar Alperovitz and Lew Daly (2008) argue in Unjust Deserts that the wealth of today’s rich owes largely to society’s accumulated knowledge and public investments, so a commons fund capturing some of this “common inheritance” is justifiable. If automation accelerates the concentration of wealth, without public countermeasures we risk a neo-feudal wealth structure where, as economist Richard Freeman put it, “ who owns the robots rules the world ”. Freeman (2015) and others have suggested employee or public ownership of robots as a remedy – e.g. through robotic capital funds that buy shares in automation equipment and distribute the proceeds. Another concrete policy is the idea of a “robot tax” : taxing companies for each job replaced by a robot or for automation profits, using the revenue for social programs or UBI . Notably, a 2021 study by Guerreiro, Rebelo & Teles in Review of Economic Studies modeled optimal taxation in an automated economy and found that taxing robots or capital can indeed improve welfare under certain conditions. However , setting the correct tax rate is tricky – too high and you stifle innovation; too low and you get rampant inequality. Bill Gates famously floated the robot tax idea in 2017, arguing that slowing automation slightly to retrain workers and fund UBI might be socially beneficial . What would an ideal post-labor sovereign balance sheet look like? One vision is a state that holds significant equity stakes in the economy and thus earns dividend income at scale. This could be achieved via explicit nationalization of certain industries, or through incremental accumulation (for instance, using central bank quantitative easing not just to buy government bonds but to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks for public ownership). In fact, the Bank of Japan in recent years has purchased equities (ETFs) as part of its monetary policy, blurring the line between central banking and a national investment fund. Some heterodox proposals (e.g. those associated with Modern Monetary Theory) advocate a National Investment Authority or public asset manager that would invest in green and high-tech industries, sharing the returns with citizens. Mariana Mazzucato’s work on the “entrepreneurial state” has been1 2 1 5 extended to argue that if the state shoulders risk in innovation, it should also reap returns – e.g. via royalties or equity in successful tech companies. In a post-labor future, that principle might be expanded: the state as venture capitalist for automation, ensuring that when AI and robotics drive growth, the public gets a cut. There is also renewed interest in universal public services as a complementary approach: rather than (or in addition to) giving cash dividends, the state could guarantee free or affordable services (health, education, housing, transport) to reduce the cost of living in a job-scarce world. This Universal Basic Services (UBS) model (advocated by Coote & Percy 2020) posits that some needs are better met directly than by individuals buying them with UBI cash. UBS can be seen as another way to socialise the benefits of productivity – e.g. if robots can build houses cheaply, the state could ensure housing for all, effectively distributing the productivity gain in-kind. Central Bank Architecture: Central banks may need to adapt structurally to a post-labor reality. One intriguing idea is a “People’s Quantitative Easing” , where central banks create money to finance public investments or social dividends in times of low demand, rather than solely manipulating interest rates. If unemployment is no longer the key variable (because many are structurally jobless by automation), central banks might target metrics like the income share of the bottom 50%, or a nominal GDP growth path, to ensure broadly shared prosperity. The post-2008 era already saw central banks buying trillions in assets, which had distributional side effects (boosting wealth for asset-holders). In a post-labor scenario, there could be pressure for central banks to explicitly account for distribution. For example, some have proposed that a CBDC-based UBI could be a tool to tame inflation while ensuring equity . The idea is that by issuing a digital currency directly to people, central banks can support spending when needed, and conversely could withdraw liquidity (e.g. via negative interest or temporary taxes on digital wallets) if inflation rises, thus fine-tuning aggregate demand. This merges monetary policy with a social safety net. While technically conceivable, it amounts to a radical rethinking of central bank mandates and democratic oversight thereof. Another aspect is the coordination between central banks and fiscal sovereign funds: some research suggests sovereign wealth could backstop monetary operations. For instance, a public wealth fund’s assets might serve as collateral for central bank digital currency issuance, or conversely the central bank might directly manage a portion of the sovereign fund for macro stabilization purposes. Such cooperation could provide liquidity in downturns without solely relying on private markets. In practice, public wealth funds and central banks will also face political economy constraints . Vested interests may resist large-scale redistribution of capital ownership. The financial sector might chafe at a central bank doing “social policy.” To succeed, any transition to a post-labor public wealth regime likely requires broad political buy-in and international coordination (to prevent capital flight, see next section). Some initial steps can be seen: for example, discussions of global wealth taxes (advocated by Piketty and by Landais, Saez & Zucman for Europe) could rein in private wealth concentration and fund public coffers. The IMF and others have also studied the idea of using state-owned assets more productively – noting that many governments sit on vast public lands, companies, and resources that could form the basis of wealth funds. Ultimately, stabilizing a post-labor economy may require the state to take on a more explicit role as “shareholder of last resort,” owning shares of the economy to guarantee that even if private labor income declines, public dividends can support consumption and investment. This is a profound shift from the neoliberal model of minimal state interference, aligning more with an updated form of democratic socialism or a market economy with substantial public stakeholding. The tension between efficiency and equity here is a matter of debate – proponents argue that public investment can be done smartly, while critics fear politicization and loss of market discipline. These unresolved issues show why Post-Labor Economics not only needs economic innovation but also governance innovation to manage collective wealth. 6 Material Throughput Constraints of Automation: Beyond Energy Visions of a highly automated, AI-driven economy often assume technology can deliver boundless productivity. However , an automated future still ultimately faces the hard limits of physics, ecology, and resource availability . Economists and systems thinkers from ecological economics caution that any post- labor utopia must reckon with material throughput constraints – the flows of energy and materials required to build, power , and maintain all those robots, data centers, and automated infrastructure. In this section, we examine the often overlooked inputs to automation: land, minerals, metals, and ecological sinks for waste. We also explore how input-output modeling and circular economy principles inform the sustainability of a post-labor system, and highlight critical minerals as a potential choke point. Every advanced AI system or robot is embedded in a vast material and energy network . As Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler starkly documented in “Anatomy of an AI System,” even a seemingly ethereal device like a voice-activated Amazon Echo rests upon global supply chains of mining, logistics, and electronic waste disposal . Each command to “Alexa” triggers an invisible extraction of resources: rare earth elements in its magnets, lithium in its batteries, silicon in its chips, and the electricity (often fossil-fueled) that powers data centers responding to the query . Crawford’s study traces how a single Echo unit depends on lithium from the salt flats of Bolivia (the Salar de Uyuni, holding 50–70% of global lithium reserves) and other minerals, only to eventually end up as e-waste since the device is not designed for easy repair or recycling . The sobering takeaway is that automation’s convenience is not immaterial – “each small moment of convenience…requires a vast planetary network, fueled by the extraction of non-renewable materials, labor, and data” . In fact, delivering trivial automated tasks can consume orders of magnitude more resources than doing them manually . The energy costs of training large AI models and running server farms are huge (for instance, training a single advanced AI model can emit carbon equivalent to dozens of cars’ lifetimes), but beyond energy, the material footprint – copper for wiring, concrete and steel for server warehouses, cobalt and nickel for batteries, etc. – presents a long-term sustainability challenge. A fully automated economy implies mass deployment of hardware : robots in factories, autonomous vehicles, IoT devices, vast cloud computing infrastructures. This means intensifying demand for a suite of minerals and materials, many of which are geologically scarce or geographically concentrated. Notably, many automation and clean energy technologies overlap in their resource needs: e.g. rare earth elements like neodymium, dysprosium, and praseodymium for high-strength magnets in motors and wind turbines; lithium, cobalt, manganese for batteries; platinum group metals for electronics and catalysts. According to a 2024 study in Nature Geoscience , the rare earth element (REE) demand is set to skyrocket with the green and digital transition. Currently, China dominates both the mining and processing of REEs, creating strategic vulnerabilities. The study’s advanced modeling found that by 2050, around 30–40% of REE demand in the U.S., EU, and China could be met through aggressive recycling and reuse, significantly reducing dependence on virgin mining. This is a heartening potential – circular economy strategies could supply nearly a third of critical minerals by mid-century, easing geopolitical and environmental pressure. However , that leaves 60–70% still reliant on new extraction. Moreover , China’s in-ground rare earth wealth (estimated ~$1.7 trillion) vastly exceeds that of the U.S. (~$44 billion), meaning that, in the absence of recycling, countries like the U.S. and those in Europe will remain highly import-dependent for these automation- critical materials. This raises the specter of resource-driven geopolitical blocs : nations rich in automation minerals (or energy) could wield significant leverage, akin to oil producers in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. In a post-labor context, wars and trade conflicts might be fought not over labor or cheap goods, but over lithium, cobalt, and rare earth supply chains.3 4 5 6 6 7 Material criticality extends beyond rare earths. Even mundane resources like sand (for concrete and silicon) are finite and already under strain globally. High-tech devices require dozens of elements (a smartphone contains some 60 different elements). If production scales up for universal automation, shortages or price spikes in any of these could bottleneck the whole system. We have seen how supply chain disruptions (e.g. a pandemic or a trade war) can cripple semiconductor availability, which in turn slows auto manufacturing and other sectors. Now imagine that on a larger scale for multiple inputs. This reality tempers the exponential growth dreams: automation will not be constrained by ideas or algorithms alone, but by “atoms” – the physical building blocks and byproducts. For instance, the fabrication of advanced robots and AI hardware is extremely energy- and water-intensive (chip fabs consume millions of gallons of ultra-pure water and enormous electricity), and they produce toxic waste that must be managed. Ecological economics emphasizes the laws of thermodynamics : no process is 100% efficient, and the entropy (disorder) in the form of waste heat and pollution accumulates. Without careful design, a highly automated economy could accelerate environmental degradation by sheer volume of output, even if each unit is made more efficiently. To navigate these constraints, scholars propose embracing circular economy principles in the design of automation technology. The circular economy aims to shift from the linear “take-make-dispose” model to a loop where products are reused, refurbished, or recycled continuously. Walter Stahel, who coined the concept, argued that extending the life of products and reusing materials can “save resources and energy and create local jobs” – a win-win that becomes even more crucial in a job-sparse future. In practice, this means designing robots and electronics for disassembly, recovering materials like rare earth magnets from end-of- life equipment, and utilizing remanufacturing. Research indicates significant gains: one study found that recycling and reuse could raise secondary supply of REEs by ~700 kilotons and reduce primary demand by over 2,300 kilotons by 2050. This would also mitigate the need to mine in environmentally sensitive areas (deep-sea mining or rainforest mining) which exact heavy social and ecological costs. Input-output models from industrial ecology help quantify these scenarios by tracing material flows across sectors. For example, an input-output analysis might reveal how increased output in the “robot manufacturing” sector drives up inputs from the “electronics” and “mining” sectors, which in turn require inputs from energy, chemicals, and so on, ultimately linking to environmental emissions. By plugging circular loops into these models (e.g. adding a recycling sector that feeds recovered materials back into manufacturing), one can simulate how resource consumption and pollution could be reduced for a given level of automation output. Another key concept is mineral substitutability : can we redesign technologies to use less-scarce materials? For instance, electric vehicle motors currently rely on neodymium-iron-boron magnets; research is exploring magnet designs that use fewer or no rare earths, or alternative battery chemistries that don’t need cobalt. Such innovation can ease critical bottlenecks. But often, trade-offs arise – the alternatives might be less efficient or introduce other dependencies. Furthermore, extraction itself can be automated : mining companies are deploying autonomous trucks and drills. While this might lower the cost of mining, it also could accelerate resource depletion if not regulated, and it removes a source of human jobs (though mining is dangerous, so some displacement there could be socially beneficial if workers are compensated). A fully automated economy also raises the question of throughput limits to growth . If marginal production costs approach zero, conventional economics would predict infinite consumption—yet clearly infinite material consumption is impossible on a finite planet. Ecological economists like Herman Daly argue for a steady-state economy where throughput is kept within ecological limits. In a post-labor vision, the challenge is ensuring that the pursuit of efficiency via automation does not lead to rebound effects that wipe out environmental gains. A classic rebound is the Jevons paradox: increasing efficiency (e.g. robots 8 making products with less labor and possibly less energy per unit) can lower costs and thus increase total consumption, potentially increasing total resource use. For example, if 3D printing and robots make goods very cheap, people might buy far more stuff (or replace it more often), increasing aggregate materials usage unless counteracted by cultural or policy shifts. Some propose coupling UBI or dividends with sustainability conditions – for instance, higher taxes on luxury carbon-intensive consumption, or using part of sovereign wealth fund returns to invest in renewable energy and regenerative agriculture, ensuring that automated abundance does not come at the expense of climate and ecosystems. The “ Doughnut Economics” framework (Raworth 2017) is apt: ensure the social foundation (everyone’s needs met, possibly via UBI/services) while not exceeding the ecological ceiling (planetary boundaries). In summary, the material edge of post-labor economics demands as much innovation as the technical side. Automation does not free us from dependence on nature; it changes the form of that dependence. Instead of human sweat, we’ll sweat the periodic table. The critical issues include securing supply of key inputs (potentially via stockpiling or strategic trade alliances), minimizing waste and designing for recyclability, and possibly scaling back certain consumption expectations to fit within Earth’s carrying capacity. Encouragingly, a more automated economy might facilitate better tracking of material flows – sensors and AI could improve recycling efficiency and optimize resource use. But without deliberate policy, market forces alone might ignore externalities and run into resource shocks. Post-labor theorists thus increasingly intersect with ecological economics , insisting that any blueprint for a future economy must be grounded in physical reality. The next section will examine how these material concerns and others play out on the geopolitical stage, where nations jostle for advantage in a world of mobile capital and uneven resource endowments. Geopolitical Repercussions: Capital Flight, Monetary Blocs, and Trade Realignment Economic paradigms do not change in a vacuum; global political economy greatly influences, and is influenced by, the transition to a post-labor system. Here we analyze how nations and international relations might be reshaped by widespread automation, focusing on five interrelated issues: capital flight , monetary and financial blocs , trade realignment , development stratification , and the risk of technological hegemony . Essentially, if one country or region aggressively pursues a post-labor , highly redistributive model, can it do so alone or would it require new forms of international coordination? And how will automation alter the balance of economic power between countries? Capital Flight and Tax Competition: A recurring concern is that if a single country heavily taxes capital or enacts policies favoring labor-displacing tech alongside generous welfare, it might scare off investors. Capital (both financial and human capital) is highly mobile in today’s globalized economy. Wealth holders could respond to a robot tax or high dividend taxes by shifting their assets abroad to friendlier jurisdictions. Indeed, we already see intense competition over corporate taxes – prior to the recent global minimum tax accord, many multinationals would register profits in low-tax countries to avoid higher taxes at home. In a post-labor scenario, where funding universal incomes might require substantial taxes on profits, data, or wealth, capital flight is a genuine risk. Historical experience shows that when countries have imposed wealth taxes or strict regulations, capital often finds loopholes or leaves (for example, wealthy French citizens decamped to Belgium or the UK during France’s 2010s wealth tax episode). To counteract this, international coordination is key. The proposal by Landais, Saez & Zucman (2020) for a progressive European wealth tax to fund COVID recovery is an example of a coordinated approach: if major economies jointly agree to tax capital, the escape options dwindle. For a post-labor transition, one could envision 9 coalitions of countries agreeing on minimum corporate tax rates (as indeed 130+ countries did for a 15% minimum in 2021), or even an “Automation Dividend Treaty” where countries all levy, say, a 5% robot tax so that no single country is uniquely penalized for doing so. Absent such coordination, a nation trying to fund UBI through heavy capital taxation could see investors flee and its currency weaken as money flows out, undermining its goals. Capital controls (limitations on money leaving the country) are another tool, but these can have other costs and are viewed unfavorably by markets. Nonetheless, if inequality and unemployment worsen globally, more nations might resort to capital controls and closed financial circuits to protect their social policies – marking a departure from the hyper-globalization era. Monetary Blocs and Currency Realignment: The distributional effects of automation might also drive new monetary alliances or blocs . Consider that advanced economies with high automation might experience chronically low interest rates and weak labor-driven inflation, as discussed earlier . Meanwhile, emerging economies that still rely on labor-intensive industries could see capital outflows and pressure on their currencies if investors favor automated markets (or simply if their export advantages erode). One scenario is a fragmentation of the global monetary order: automated high-income countries (perhaps forming a bloc around the US or EU) versus labor-rich developing countries (perhaps forming their own cooperative blocs for bargaining power). If social unrest grows in struggling regions, some might adopt alternative currency systems or align with major powers for support. For instance, if a wealthy nation implements a generous UBI that also covers or attracts immigrants, it might prompt neighboring countries to coordinate policies to manage migration and currency impacts (more on migration below). We might see regional monetary funds or digital currency areas that facilitate resource sharing – e.g. a group of countries could create a joint sovereign wealth fund and digital currency to pay a basic income across borders, tying themselves into a stable monetary unit insulated from capital flight to traditional havens. This is speculative, but it underscores that monetary policy sovereignty could be stress-tested by post-labor dynamics. Central banks might need new lender-of-last-resort arrangements if unemployment no longer anchors inflation – possibly cooperating through the IMF or new institutions to handle global liquidity in a world where deflationary pressures dominate in some areas and inflationary supply shocks dominate in others (like resource-exporting vs. resource-importing blocs). Another dimension is technological spheres of influence . There is already talk of a U.S.-centered versus China-centered tech ecosystem (with separate standards, payment systems, etc.). Automation could deepen this bifurcation. For example, if China’s state-driven model allows faster deployment of AI but under an authoritarian regime, other nations may choose to bandwagon on that system or deliberately decouple and form an alternative bloc that prioritizes different values (e.g. an EU-led “human-centric AI” bloc). These blocs might have their own digital currencies (China’s digital yuan vs potential Western CBDCs) and trade within themselves. The risk is a fractured global economy with reduced cooperation just when collective action (on tax, climate, etc.) is most needed. Trade Realignment and the End of Labor Arbitrage: Global trade patterns historically have been driven by comparative advantage, including differences in labor costs. The last few decades saw manufacturing shift to low-wage countries (China, Southeast Asia, Mexico, etc.), creating complex global supply chains. If automation (robots, 3D printing, AI-managed operations) makes labor cost differentials less relevant, production could re-localize to be closer to consumer markets or critical inputs. This trend, sometimes called “reshoring” or “localized manufacturing,” could profoundly disrupt export-dependent economies. For instance, if the U.S. or Europe can competitively produce textiles or electronics via automation, countries like Bangladesh or Vietnam, which rely on low-cost garment and electronics assembly labor , could lose their export markets. That implies a potential development trap : those nations might de-industrialize before 10 fully industrializing – a phenomenon dubbed “premature deindustrialization.” Already, some developing countries struggle to emulate the manufacturing-led growth path that richer countries took; full automation could close that path entirely, requiring new development models (perhaps focusing on services, creative industries, or regional self-sufficiency). International political economy scholars point out that such shifts could lead to trade realignment : countries rich in capital and tech might trade more with each other (exchanging IP, data, and high-tech goods) while countries with lagging automation might either become marginalized or focus on exporting raw materials and agricultural goods (which remain harder to automate demand for). This bifurcation could exacerbate global inequality. One country’s post-labor paradise could be another’s depression. For example, if agricultural work is automated in rich countries via AI-driven vertical farms and robots, then agricultural exporters in the Global South might lose markets, harming rural livelihoods. Conversely, resource-rich countries might gain clout: as mentioned, if you have lithium or cobalt or rare earths, you have leverage. This could encourage a form of neo-mercantilism where countries impose export controls on critical materials (we already saw China signal rare earth export bans in trade disputes) or form cartels (imagine an OPEC-like cartel for battery metals). Trade alliances might reconfigure around these needs – for instance, the U.S. and EU forging partnerships with resource-rich African or Latin American nations, possibly involving technology transfers or aid in exchange for secure access to materials. Financial Flows and “Technological Colonization”: Another geopolitical concern is that of technological hegemony : the nations (or firms) that develop and own AI and robotics could extract rents globally, in effect “colonizing” other economies digitally. Big Tech firms today already have outsize influence; in a more automated world, they might provide the AI services and machinery that everyone uses, collecting fees and data from all corners of the world. This could be seen as a form of imperialism, where instead of occupying land, dominant powers occupy digital and automated infrastructure. Countries may respond by insisting on local data storage, local AI development (tech sovereignty), or by forming coalitions to develop open-source alternatives (as a counterweight to big corporate or national powers). If they fail, wealth could siphon from the periphery to the core even more efficiently than under industrial capitalism. Migration and Labor Markets: Geopolitics of post-labor also involve human movement. If jobs vanish in some regions without adequate social support, people may migrate in search of livelihoods. But destination countries that have embraced automation and UBI might be unwilling to accept many migrants, especially if those migrants would need to be supported by the host’s welfare system without clear employment prospects. This could strain international relations and raise ethical questions: do wealthy automated nations have an obligation to share their productivity gains beyond their borders (perhaps via development aid or a global basic income fund)? Some have floated the notion of a global basic income funded by a tax on multinational tech companies, which could help address disparities between nations. Short of that, we could see more regional integration efforts – e.g. African or South Asian blocs implementing their own automation and social policy compacts to reduce the incentive for out-migration. Migration policy might thus pivot from “how do we fill labor shortages?” (a typical concern today for aging rich countries) to “how do we equitably manage surplus labor globally?”. If robots do the work, rich countries may prefer to keep their populations smaller and more homogenous, potentially tightening borders. This scenario risks deepening a global apartheid between automated prosperity zones and marginalized labor reservoirs. Alternatively, if handled cooperatively, automation’s gains could allow reduced working hours globally and support for all – fulfilling the old ideal that technology frees everyone, not just a few. 11 Monetary Blocs and Digital Currencies: Lastly, “monetary blocs” might also refer to the advent of digital currencies that transcend national boundaries. Tech companies or consortia could issue their own currencies (Facebook’s attempted Libra/Diem is a harbinger) that, if widely adopted, challenge traditional currencies. A post-labor economy heavily mediated by platforms might see, say, a “AmazonCoin” or “RenminbiCoin” used across borders to pay for automated services. Nations might then form blocs either adopting these currencies or outlawing them. Central banks are racing to issue CBDCs to avoid losing monetary sovereignty to private digital money. The outcome will shape geopolitical leverage: whichever standard becomes dominant (USD-backed stablecoins? China’s digital yuan? a decentralized crypto?) could influence how economic influence is distributed. In summary, the geopolitical edge of post-labor economics suggests a future of both cooperation and conflict. To avoid a dystopian outcome where only a few nations reap the benefits of automation, there likely needs to be international agreements on taxation, data governance, and resource sharing . We see early steps, such as global tax discussions and supply chain “friend-shoring” debates, but these must accelerate in scope. Otherwise, unilateral moves (like one country unilaterally trying a big UBI funded by taxing capital) may falter amid global market pressures. Conversely, coordinated moves (like an EU-wide or OECD-wide adoption of robot taxes and wealth funds) could set a model that capital can’t easily evade. The formation of monetary or trading blocs around those shared values could buttress such efforts. This is an area where heterodox political economy and international relations converge: power dynamics and class dynamics now play out not just domestically but on the world stage, with capital and labor redefined by technology. The next section will zoom back in on the domestic social fabric – examining which groups within societies are most vulnerable or empowered in this transition, and how automation might intersect with existing inequalities of class, race, gender , and citizenship. Stratification and Economic Agency in an Automated Society Far from being a great equalizer , automation is likely to have uneven impacts across different social groups . Class, race, gender , and migration status all mediate who is most at risk of job displacement and who stands to benefit from the new wealth and technologies. Post-labor economic theory must therefore grapple with issues of intersectionality – understanding how overlapping systems of oppression and privilege shape economic outcomes in an automated future. Additionally, the decline of traditional work raises questions about new forms of collective agency for those who have been structurally marginalized: if jobs no longer provide identity and bargaining power , how can various communities assert control over their economic lives? This section examines differential automation risks and the social challenges of ensuring equity and inclusion in a post-labor economy. Class and Educational Attainment: By definition, those with fewer skills and economic resources are more vulnerable to being displaced and less equipped to adapt. Routine manual and cognitive jobs that are easiest to automate (factory work, warehouse labor , basic clerical tasks, retail cashiers, etc.) have historically been held by the working class and lower-middle class. Analyses consistently show an inverse relationship between skill level (or education) and automation risk. For example, a U.S. study found that a white male with only a high school degree had dramatically higher estimated automation risk than a white male with a Bachelor’s degree (the latter had ~21% lower risk). In effect, education acts as insulation from automation – not because robots cannot do any tasks of college graduates, but because higher education correlates with jobs involving complex human interaction, creative problem-solving, and non-routine analysis that current AI finds harder to replicate. Thus, without policy intervention, automation could worsen class divides: low- income, less-educated workers lose their jobs or see wages depressed, while high-educated professionals 12 might thrive by complementing AI or working in tech development. However , even higher education is no guarantee in the long run – some professional work (basic legal drafting, radiology scanning, accounting entries) is being augmented or automated by AI. So the stratification may occur within the educated classes as well, between those who leverage technology and those whose white-collar tasks are commoditized by it. This calls for massive investments in retraining and lifelong learning , so that displaced workers (whether factory workers or paralegals) can move into emerging roles. Yet, retraining has limits if the total number of jobs shrinks. Some heterodox thinkers argue that no amount of reskilling will create enough new jobs if we truly approach a workless economy; hence, the focus must shift to distribution and meaningful non-work roles. Race and Ethnicity: In many countries, racial and ethnic minorities are overrepresented in the very jobs most susceptible to automation. In the U.S., Black and Hispanic workers are more likely to work in occupations such as manufacturing, transportation (e.g. truck and taxi drivers), food service, and administrative support – all areas seeing significant automation pressure (robots, self-driving vehicles, algorithms, kiosks). A detailed study (McManus et al. 2023) found that, holding other factors constant, Black, Hispanic, and Native American men face significantly higher automation risks (+5.8%, +3.9%, +2.8% respectively) compared to white men. Black and Hispanic women, on average, also show higher risk than white women (though interestingly slightly lower than white men in that study, likely because women are more in health, education, or service roles that are somewhat less automatable in the short term). The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies estimated that over 31% of Latino workers and 27% of Black workers in the U.S. are concentrated in just 30 high-risk occupations (e.g. cashiers, cooks, drivers, stock clerks). In contrast, white and Asian workers are better represented in lower-risk professional occupations (though Asian men in the U.S. also have high representation in engineering which is more complementarily placed with AI). The implication is that absent intervention, automation could exacerbate racial wealth gaps and unemployment disparities. We could see a replay of deindustrialization’s racial impacts: e.g. the automation of manufacturing in the 1970s–80s disproportionately hurt Black communities in cities like Detroit and Cleveland, contributing to unemployment and urban decay. A future wave of AI-induced layoffs could similarly hit minority communities hardest, potentially fueling social unrest and widening inequities. Addressing this requires explicitly intersectional policies . For instance, targeted training programs for underrepresented groups in tech and engineering, to ensure they can partake in the new high-skilled jobs. Also, affirmative action in new industries or even quotas for minority-owned businesses in the automated economy. Another idea is community wealth-building : models like the cooperative networks in Cleveland’s Evergreen Cooperatives or the “Preston model” in the UK aim to anchor jobs and assets in minority communities. Even if traditional jobs shrink, these communities are experimenting with cooperative ownership of businesses (solar installation co-ops, local food production, etc.) to create resilient local economies. Such efforts, as Grodach & Martin (2022) note, are not fully post-labor (people still work in co- ops) but they decouple livelihoods from external labor markets to some degree , giving communities more control. This approach could be vital if minority communities face systematic exclusion from whatever jobs remain. Additionally, policies like Baby Bonds (as proposed by Sandy Darity and others) – giving every newborn, especially from less wealthy families, a trust fund that matures in adulthood – could start to even out racial wealth differences and prepare the next generation for an economy where inherited capital might matter more than labor income. Gender: The effect of automation on gender equality is nuanced. Early research suggested that men might be more exposed to automation than women because men dominate in manufacturing and manual labor jobs, whereas women are more present in health care, education, and service jobs that involve 13 interpersonal skills and caring – tasks not easily automated by current AI. Indeed, one cross-country study found women overall have slightly lower automation risk than men, especially in countries with high gender equality (where more women work in professional roles). The McManus et al. study in the U.S. similarly found white and Black women had slightly lower risk than white men (1–2% lower), while Hispanic and Asian women had slightly higher risk (0.5–0.8% higher , likely reflecting concentration in certain service jobs). Thus, in aggregate, automation might not worsen gender unemployment gaps and might even reduce some disparities (for example, self-driving trucks could hit the heavily male trucker occupation). However , job quality and wages are a concern: many “safe” female-majority jobs like home healthcare aide, childcare, cleaning, etc., are low-paid and precarious. If those aren’t automated, that doesn’t necessarily empower women – it may simply mean women remain stuck in low-paid care roles while men’s higher-paid manual jobs are replaced by machines. Moreover , some of these roles will see automation pressures (e.g. AI in teaching or caregiving robots for elder care). There is also a risk that automation could reinforce gender biases: AI systems trained on biased data might, for instance, prefer hiring men for tech jobs (we’ve seen hiring algorithms that discriminated against women). Or automated performance monitoring in warehouses (like Amazon’s) can disproportionately penalize workers (male or female) who cannot maintain punishing productivity metrics, often hurting those with caregiving responsibilities (disproportionately women). On the flip side, automation of housework and care work – if realized – could liberate many women from unpaid domestic labor . The classic feminist argument is that freeing women from domestic drudgery and childrearing via technology (or public provision) enables true equality. A fully automated luxury future often imagines robots cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, even assisting with elder care. If governments support the diffusion of such technologies to households (not just to the rich), women’s unpaid workload could drop dramatically, potentially enabling greater participation in other pursuits (paid work, education, leisure). But this raises another concern: if care work is automated or taken over by platforms, will that undervalue the remaining human care professions even more? We might end up in a dystopia where care work is split – wealthy people use robot nannies and tutors, while care work for the poor is underfunded and devalued. To ensure gender equity, proactive measures include promoting women in STEM and AI development (so that the creators of automation are not almost all men, as is currently the case, which would risk entrenching male-centric design). Also, social policies like paid family leave, flexible work, and subsidized childcare remain crucial in any scenario – these help women (and men) balance life in a partially automated world. Finally, the concept of a Universal Basic Services framework – providing care, education, health as rights – can benefit women tremendously, as it both recognizes and socializes the labor traditionally done by women. Migration and Citizenship: Migrant workers often fill the “3D” jobs (dirty, dangerous, dull) in many economies – from crop picking and meatpacking to domestic work and low-end service. These are among jobs targeted by automation (e.g. agricultural robots, automated slaughterhouses, robotic vacuum cleaners). If these jobs disappear , migrants may lose a key entry path to better lives, and remittance- dependent communities back home could suffer . Moreover , political support for immigration might erode further if native populations are themselves jobless or perceive migrants as competitors for dwindling work. We could see more exclusionary policies where citizenship or legal status determines who gets the UBI or social dividend. For instance, will non-citizens in a country be eligible for its basic income? If not, a subclass of people could be left destitute or forced to migrate elsewhere. Even within wealthy countries, current debates around immigrants’ access to welfare will intensify in a post-labor context. This is a blind spot in some UBI proposals – many assume a closed economy of citizens. In reality, high-UBI countries could attract immigrants unless restricted; how to handle that ethically is unresolved. One approach could be 14 global or regional basic income frameworks , as mentioned, to uplift source countries and reduce migration push factors. Another could be a “participation income” concept (Tony Atkinson’s idea) where people qualify for basic income by contributing in various forms (not just employment) – this might include migrants if they perform care or community service, thereby integrating them rather than excluding. We should also consider that some advanced countries (like in the Gulf) rely on migrant labor for almost all menial jobs; if they automate those jobs (say robotic construction, driverless cabs in Dubai, automated domestic servants), the entire migrant workforce could be expelled or not needed. Those countries would then face a need to occupy their own citizens (possibly with make-work public jobs or generous stipends as some already do). Source countries (like India, Philippines, Pakistan, etc. for Gulf migrants) would lose remittances which are huge parts of their GDP. This exemplifies how automation can send shockwaves through the global South via labor markets. Collective Agency and Identity: With traditional employment diminished, labor unions – historically a major vehicle for worker power – might dwindle unless they transform. We are already seeing union membership decline with the rise of gig and precarious work. In a future where permanent jobs are rare, collective bargaining might shift toward negotiating social policies (like a union of citizens lobbying for higher UBI, rather than a union of workers bargaining for higher wages from an employer). New forms of collective economic agency might emerge: for example, data unions or platform cooperatives where individuals pool their data or labor on digital platforms to negotiate better terms. There are experiments in “platform cooperativism ” (Scholz 2016) – imagine an Uber owned by its drivers or a distributed autonomous organization that collectively owns AI algorithms. Blockchain technologies have even prompted ideas of tokenizing contributions so that people can earn micro-dividends for training AI models or contributing content. These could give individuals some control and income from the new economy rather than being passive recipients. Community currencies might arise as well, especially if national currencies are tightly controlled; local groups might trade services or goods via credits independent of formal jobs. Another aspect of agency is political participation . Some theorists posit that if people are freed from toil, they may engage more in civic life. The preprint review notes the irony that as everyday economic roles decline, people might seek influence through politics – leading to innovations like participatory budgeting, citizen assemblies for tech governance, and AI-facilitated deliberative democracy. Indeed, maintaining democratic legitimacy might demand more direct citizen voice when work no longer binds people to a certain class position or employer . Citizens with ample free time and a guaranteed basic income might question technocratic decisions and demand a say in how automation is deployed and governed. This could be a positive force (revitalizing democracy) or , if mismanaged, could turn into populist upheavals (e.g. if people channel their frustration into nativism or anti-tech movements). The key will be giving people a constructive outlet for agency – such as local co-determination of automation policies, citizen oversight of AI ethics, or community benefit agreements when new tech is introduced. In conclusion, automation does not eliminate human agency or social struggle – it shifts their terrain . Inequalities across class, race, gender , and nationality may deepen if policy is blind to them, but with intentional design, a post-labor society could also mitigate some inequalities (e.g. reducing racial income gaps through universal policies, relieving women of unpaid drudgery, offering a safety net to all regardless of formal employment). A recurring theme is that universalist solutions (like UBI) must be supplemented by targeted and structural solutions (like anti-discrimination, education equity, community investment) to ensure no group is left behind. Unresolved tensions abound: for instance, is a society without traditional work 15 going to liberate people (more time for family, creativity, and community) or leave them aimless and prone to division? Will people find solidarity in their shared status as “recipients of the social dividend,” or will new cleavages emerge (perhaps between those who own robots and those who rely on public support)? These questions segue into the final analytical section: how economic theory itself must adapt to address these challenges, and where the biggest gaps in our knowledge lie. Adapting Macroeconomic Theory: Unresolved Tensions and New Paradigms The rise of a post-labor economy confronts contemporary economic theory with phenomena it was not built to handle. Traditional macroeconomic models center on employment, wages, and output – concepts blurred when machines do most work and humans may not need to “earn” a livelihood through jobs. Similarly, political economy frameworks (capitalism vs socialism, etc.) assume a central conflict between labor and capital, but what happens when labor’s role diminishes? In this section, we highlight unresolved theoretical tensions and the areas where Post-Labor Economics demands new ideas or synthesis across schools of thought. We also identify points of convergence where different paradigms surprisingly agree, and divergence where fundamental assumptions clash, requiring creative reconciliation. The Productivity Paradox and Growth Theory: A basic puzzle is whether automation will herald explosive productivity growth (as one might expect if machines produce far more output per worker) or whether we might paradoxically see stagnation. Historically, technological revolutions took time to show up in productivity statistics (“Solow’s paradox”). Lately, despite AI and computing advances, many advanced economies have experienced tepid productivity growth – possibly because benefits are unevenly distributed or mismeasured. In a post-labor scenario, measuring output itself becomes tricky: GDP counts goods and services, but if many are provided at near-zero cost (open-source software, AI-generated content, etc.), traditional GDP might undercount actual welfare gains. Moreover , if machines produce plenty but incomes aren’t distributed, demand shortages could keep actual output below potential – a sort of secular stagnation trap. Orthodox growth theory (Solow model, etc.) might suggest that removing labor as a limiting factor allows unbounded growth until resource limits hit. But endogenous growth models emphasize the role of ideas and human capital – will AI start generating ideas itself, causing a feedback loop of innovation? Some optimists foresee a singularity-like growth surge; others warn of “the great stagnation” if human purpose and consumption falter . Empirically, Acemoglu & Restrepo (2020) found robots had a significant disemployment effect in US local labor markets, but did not boost aggregate productivity as much as expected, partly because of offsetting demand declines. This suggests our models need to integrate distribution dynamics tightly with growth – something heterodox Keynesian models do, but many standard models do not. One promising approach is VEPL (Variable Elasticity of Substitution) production functions or task-based models that allow partial automation and consider the creation of new tasks (Acemoglu & Restrepo 2018). These show that if automation is too rapid compared to new task creation, labor share and wages fall – which can indeed reduce innovation incentives (a point also made by early 19th century economists like Ricardo and later by Marx). Schumpeterian perspectives add another twist: creative destruction might be different when creation no longer brings many new jobs. You could destroy industries and create new ones that employ only a handful of engineers, yielding a net loss in employment that could undermine social stability needed for innovation acceptance. Convergence Across Schools: Interestingly, several disparate schools converge on the idea that without deliberate intervention, a highly automated capitalism could become unstable or “techno-feudal.” 16 Mainstream economists (though usually optimistic about long-run adjustments) acknowledge rising inequality and possible demand problems. Meanwhile, Marxian and leftist theorists have long foreseen a scenario where capital essentially no longer needs labor , leading to what Marx called the “army of labor reserves” – a mass of unemployed or underemployed who exert no wage pressure, potentially driving wages to subsistence while capital captures all surplus. Yanis Varoufakis argues we are already seeing the emergence of technofeudalism , where tech oligopolies, backed by central bank liquidity, extract rents without competitive markets or full employment. This resonates with the mainstream observation of increased mark-ups and superstar firms. Both perspectives thus see a power shift from labor to capital so dramatic that it could undermine the capitalist growth engine itself – if people can’t afford goods, or if monopolists have no competition, dynamism falls. There’s also convergence on potential solutions: a number of center-right thinkers have surprisingly endorsed ideas like basic income (seeing it as a way to support consumption and social harmony), while leftists also endorse basic income (as a step toward decommodifying livelihood). Where they differ is in emphasis on ownership : many on the left argue that simply handing out UBI in a still-capitalist framework leaves the fundamental power imbalance intact (capital owners setting terms, and UBI recipients politically weak and possibly subject to benefit cuts). They prefer deeper changes like worker ownership, co-determination, or even fully automated luxury communism where the means of production are commonly owned. Libertarian or neoliberal proponents of UBI, conversely, sometimes see it as a way to avoid more radical redistribution of ownership – a safety valve to quell discontent while leaving corporate structures unchanged. UBI vs Job Guarantee – The Policy Debate: Within macroeconomic adaptation, a salient unresolved tension is between those who champion Universal Basic Income and those who advocate a Federal Job Guarantee (JG) or Universal Basic Services instead. Proponents of UBI (Van Parijs, Standing, etc.) argue that with declining need for labor , we should decouple income from work altogether and grant freedom for people to pursue their own projects. They see UBI as promoting individual freedom, entrepreneurship, volunteerism, or care work, and as a straightforward way to share automation gains. Critics, however , worry that UBI might become a meager handout that just pacifies the poor while inequality of power persists. Job Guarantee advocates like Pavlina Tchernevacounter that work (especially socially useful work) is important for dignity and community, and that the state should provide jobs at a living wage to anyone who wants one, thus establishing a labor standard and maintaining the notion of contributory participation. In a full post-labor world, a job guarantee might sound oxymoronic – if no jobs are needed, what would the state employ people to do? JG supporters answer that there are plenty of unmet human and environmental needs that markets won’t address (elder care, climate adaptation, community building). Even if these jobs are “make work” by some efficiency standards, they argue the social benefits of engagement and structure are worth it. This debate often splits along ideological lines but also practical: UBI is easier to administer (just cut checks) whereas JG requires bureaucracy to create jobs. Possibly a hybrid is needed: guarantee jobs in areas like green and care sectors for those who want purpose and higher income, plus a baseline UBI for those who either cannot or prefer not to work in the formal sense. This hybrid could mollify concerns that UBI alone either creates a stagnant underclass or that JG alone forces people into potentially low-quality jobs. Macroeconomically, a JG acts as an automatic stabilizer (government is employer of last resort, injecting money and production during slumps), whereas UBI is a constant injection that might need to be adjusted to avoid inflation. MMT economists favor JG as their inflation anchor (labor becomes the numeraire – the JG wage defines the value of currency). But if labor becomes less central, that anchor may lose force, leading some to reconsider whether a basic income funded by taxes on rents/capital could serve as a new anchor (by capping excess profits and circulating purchasing power). 17 Measurement and Welfare: Another theoretical challenge is how to measure well-being and economic progress in a post-labor society. Conventional metrics like unemployment rate, labor force participation, or even GDP might become less meaningful or need reinterpretation. If a huge portion of adults are not formally employed, a 40% unemployment rate might not signal distress if those people are productively active in other ways and have secure income. We might need new indicators: e.g. “activity rate” including volunteering and creative pursuits, or measures of leisure quality, or a Social Wealth Index that tracks the distribution of both financial and time wealth. Some propose indexing progress by reductions in working hours and increases in free time available to the median person – essentially flipping the script to treat less work as a success (provided basic needs are met). Mainstream macro has seldom optimized for leisure explicitly, often treating it as a residual in utility functions. Perhaps that should change, with models explicitly valuing the increase in non-market time made possible by automation, and distinguishing between involuntary idleness and voluntary leisure. Psychological and sociological theories must inform this: humans derive meaning from many sources, work being just one; theory should consider those other sources (community, family, art, learning) as part of the utility function or social welfare function. This requires interdisciplinary work beyond economics alone. Institutional Paradigms: Across schools, there is divergence on how much existing capitalist institutions can be reformed versus needing wholesale transformation. Orthodox macro often assumes stable institutions (private property, competitive markets) and tends to add policies like UBI as a patch. Heterodox political economy (e.g. Marxian, radical) might argue that post-labor conditions actually signal the end of capitalism’s viability – forcing a transition to a new mode of production. Some, like Mason (2015) in “Postcapitalism,” envision a gradual morphing where information goods and automation erode the price system and profit motive, paving the way for a more collaborative, commons-based economy. Others, like the accelerationist thinkers Srnicek & Williams (2015), see the opportunity to “Invent the Future” by accelerating automation and simultaneously demanding full luxury communism (UBI, high public luxury, etc.). On the other hand, techno-libertarians imagine a hyper-capitalism where governments are minimal but people somehow all have shares in the machines (perhaps through crypto tokens) – a very different path. International political economy perspectives add that the shape of the post-labor transition will be contingent on power: if left movements gain power , they may steer it toward egalitarian ends; if oligarchs entrench, we could get a neo-feudal rentier dystopia. Thus, theory must account for political feedback loops: mass unemployment could lead to populist politics (witness anger in deindustrialized regions fueling various populisms), which then affects policy choices (some might double down on protectionism or Luddism, others might double down on repression coupled with bread and circuses like token UBI). Empirical Verification Needs: Finally, a candid admission in post-labor economics is how little empirical evidence we have for the long-term effects. We have bits and pieces: historical episodes of mechanization (agriculture, manufacturing), short-term basic income experiments (Finland’s trial, Stockton’s trial, etc.), studies of robot impacts on local labor markets, and current AI deployments. But we do not have a real- world case of a society that has gone “full post-labor .” Thus, much of the theory is speculative or based on simplifying assumptions. There is a pressing need for more empirical experimentation and data: e.g. larger and longer UBI pilots (covering entire communities for a decade or more), continued observation of countries like Japan or South Korea that are automating rapidly and aging (do they follow predicted paths of more robots per worker leading to new equilibrium?), analysis of corporate behavior (do firms invest more if wages drop or does monopoly power lead them to stagnate?), and ecological-economic modeling to see if decoupling of growth from resource use can truly happen with automation. Input-output analysis mentioned earlier should be expanded and linked with macro models to stress test scenarios (e.g. what if 18 every country had the robot density of South Korea – do commodities or energy become the limiting factor?). Blind Spots: There are a few blind spots worth noting. One is the question of human motivation and meaning . Economics tends to treat leisure as desirable, but psychology warns that involuntary loss of work can be traumatic (loss of identity, purpose, routine). Will people actually thrive with ample free time, or will we see rising mental health issues, substance abuse, social isolation (some blame these partly on technological unemployment in communities hit by factory closures)? This is both an empirical and theoretical question: should providing a UBI be accompanied by investments in community centers, education, arts programs, etc., to help people find purpose? How to model that in utility terms is challenging. Another blind spot is governance of AI itself – if AI becomes a major actor in economic decision-making, how do we ensure it aligns with human values (the AI alignment problem overlaps with economics when AI runs many systems). Post-labor theory may need to incorporate algorithmic governance – e.g. algorithms deciding resource allocation could inadvertently encode biases or inefficiencies that economics would need to critique. Areas for Theoretical Innovation: Some areas ripe for innovation include: developing macro models that incorporate multiple income streams (wages, UBI, public services) and perhaps treat labor as optional; integrating ecological constraints explicitly into growth/utility models (so that infinite growth is not assumed); rethinking the concept of equilibrium – a post-labor economy might not have a clear “full employment” equilibrium, so stability criteria may differ (maybe an equilibrium of balanced income distribution and sustainable throughput replaces the old full employment + 2% inflation goal). We might also need new behavioral economics insights on how people work/consume when not forced to work – do people become entrepreneurial, or do they consume more of certain goods? For instance, some model simulations suggest if basic goods are cheap, consumption shifts to experiential goods; if those experiences are labor-intensive (tourism, handcrafted arts), that could ironically create niche jobs and income streams – an example of a complex general equilibrium effect that theory could explore (Frey’s work simulating taste shifts is noted in the review). Another theoretical frontier is property rights : proposals like data as labor (where individuals have property rights over their data and are paid for it) challenge traditional notions of free information flow in digital markets. Incorporating those rights into economic models (akin to how we treat labor property in human capital models) is needed. In conclusion, adapting macroeconomic and social theory to a post-labor reality is an ongoing endeavor . We see initial steps: hybrid models, multi-disciplinary frameworks (e.g. “doughnut economics” marrying social and environmental, “degrowth” models questioning traditional growth drivers, etc.). Points of convergence – like recognition of potential underconsumption and need for redistribution – provide a basis for broad consensus that some form of intervention is needed. Points of divergence – like whether to maintain a work-based ethos or move to a full post-work society, whether to reform capitalism or transcend it – will likely persist and be resolved through political struggle as much as academic debate. The theoretical innovations will likely coevolve with real-world experiments: as some cities or countries try new approaches, they will inform theory which in turn refines the proposals. We now proceed to conclude with a summary of unresolved tensions and the path forward for research and policy. Conclusion: Unresolved Tensions and Future Directions The exploration of macroeconomics at the edge of post-labor economics reveals a landscape of profound possibility and profound uncertainty. Automation and AI promise an economy where material abundance is 19 achievable with minimal human toil – a dream envisioned from Aristotle’s speculation about self-moving tools to Keynes’s prediction of a 15-hour workweek for his grandchildren. Yet, as we have detailed, the realization of that dream hinges on navigating a minefield of boundary conditions : economic, ecological, and social constraints that will determine whether post-labor futures are utopian or dystopian. Unresolved Tensions: Several core tensions remain unresolved and demand further theoretical and empirical work: Prosperity vs. Inequality: Automation massively raises potential output, but without new distribution mechanisms, it could concentrate wealth to an unprecedented degree. The tension between technological abundance and economic inequality is perhaps the defining challenge of post- labor economics. We do not yet know the optimal mix of policies (taxation, social wealth funds, UBI, job guarantees) to ensure broadly shared prosperity. Experiments with UBI and wealth taxes are in early stages and have not conclusively demonstrated a model for a large economy. The design of a sustainable dividend system – one that is generous, but also fiscally and politically sustainable – remains contested. For example, if UBI is set too low, poverty persists; if too high without global coordination, capital flight or inflation could ensue. Bridging this gap requires both bold trials and cooperative international frameworks. Labor as Identity vs. Liberation from Work: There is a deep cultural and psychological tension between valuing work as a source of meaning and community, versus embracing freedom from work as a path to human flourishing. This echoes the policy divide between job guarantees and basic income. The empirical truth may lie in heterogeneity: some individuals and communities may thrive in self-directed creative pursuits when freed from jobs, while others may feel lost or alienated. Societies may thus need pluralistic approaches: opportunities for those who seek work-like structure and reassurance for those who don’t. Figuring out how to avoid social fragmentation – where a segment of society feels “left behind” or purposeless – is crucial. That might involve investing in education for intrinsic learning (not just job skills), fostering arts and volunteer sectors, and redefining civic contribution. Traditional macroeconomics is ill-equipped to advise on these matters; it requires blending insights from sociology, anthropology, and psychology into economic policy design. Ecological Constraints vs. Techno-optimism: The drive for a post-labor economy often assumes continual technological progress to overcome problems, but the ecological economists remind us that there are hard limits. This tension – between green growth believers and limits-to-growth proponents – plays out in debates on whether automation will enable dematerialization or instead accelerate resource depletion. As we cited, the circular economy can mitigate some pressures (perhaps supplying ~40% of critical minerals via recycling), but not eliminate them. Blind spots include water use, biodiversity loss, and climate tipping points that were outside the scope of our discussion but are tightly interwoven. If, for instance, climate change disrupts agriculture and displaces millions, the priority might shift back from robots to basic survival needs, derailing advanced economy transitions. Thus, a major blind spot in some post-labor visions is insufficient integration of climate resilience and planetary boundaries. Future research must integrate climate- economic models (like IAMs) with automation scenarios, to see if high automation can be part of a sustainable +2°C world or if it pushes us into ecological overshoot.• • • 20 Global Convergence vs. Fragmentation: Will the world coalesce around a new economic paradigm or split into divergent systems? We identified how automation could entrench global North vs South divides or spur new alliances. An unresolved question is whether developing countries can find a path to prosperity if traditional industrialization is cut off. Some suggest leapfrogging to service or knowledge economies, but those often rely on global demand that may shrink if rich countries produce internally with robots. There’s a risk of a permanent underclass of nations. Global governance institutions (UN, World Bank, IMF) have yet to articulate strategies for a post-labor world – their frameworks still largely assume growth through jobs. A future research and policy agenda might include ideas like a Global Basic Income Fund , funded by a tax on multinational tech giants or financial transactions, to redistribute some automation dividends internationally – an idea with roots in the concept of global public goods and justice, but currently far from implementation. Alternatively, technology sharing agreements (akin to open COVID vaccine IP proposals) could help developing nations deploy automation without being wholly dependent on foreign corporations. Political Economy of Transition: Finally, a practical tension is how to get from here to there . Even if we knew the ideal end-state policies, implementing them requires overcoming political resistance from entrenched interests. Capital owners benefiting from the status quo may resist heavy taxes or loss of control; many ordinary workers, fearful of change, may resist policies that sound like giving up on jobs (hence why, politically, “job guarantee” rhetoric can be more appealing than “unconditional basic income” in some contexts). Automation itself can be suppressed or accelerated by policy – e.g. a strong labor movement might slow adoption by pushing for job protection, whereas a tech-friendly regime might subsidize it. The transition might involve a turbulent period of higher inequality and unemployment before new institutions are in place, and that instability could breed extremist politics (history shows economic dislocation often does). Thus, a big blind spot is understanding political tipping points : what levels of inequality or job loss trigger major policy shifts or radical political movements? The New Deal emerged after the Great Depression’s mass unemployment; will something analogous spur a new social contract for the AI age? We don’t know, but scholars in political economy and history can help identify parallels and potential catalysts. Areas Requiring Innovation or Verification: Based on our survey, here are specific areas where further work is needed: General equilibrium modeling of high-automation economies: Only a handful of papers (like Veal et al. 2023, Matsuyama & Chen 2022) formally model an economy near “full automation.” More such models, incorporating realistic frictions (e.g. retraining delays, political responses) would be valuable. These models should test different policy regimes (no redistribution vs UBI vs job guarantee vs social wealth fund) and their outcomes for inequality, output, and stability. They should also integrate resource constraints where possible. Empirical studies of partial post-labor analogues: We should deeply study instances that approximate post-labor conditions: resource-rich dividend economies (Alaska, Norway), highly automated industries (semiconductor manufacturing, warehousing), digital sectors with near-zero marginal cost (open source software, Wikipedia), and prolonged mass unemployment cases (like regions hit by deindustrialization). These can offer clues about human and institutional responses. For example, Alaska’s dividend improved well-being but didn’t eliminate the desire for jobs; the open-source community produces great value with volunteer work, suggesting intrinsic motivation• • • • 21 can sustain production outside labor markets. On the other hand, rust-belt towns show the dangers of unmanaged job loss. Micro-level research on behavior under basic income: As some pilot programs and experiments expand, economists and sociologists should examine how individuals allocate time with a basic income. Do they study, start businesses, care for family, or disengage? Early evidence (e.g. from pandemic stimulus or smaller UBI pilots) suggests most people did not quit working entirely and used money for basic needs and some entrepreneurial activities. But long-term cultural shifts (over generations) are unknown. This research can guide how to structure income supports (for instance, whether to supplement UBI with community programs to encourage engagement). Technological forecasting and labor substitution limits: On the more technical side, researchers in fields like robotics and AI need to map out what jobs truly can be automated in the next 10–20 years and which remain tricky. Many “automation risk” studies give probabilities, but we’ve seen that context and cost matter – e.g. truck driving might be automatable in theory, but legal and safety issues slow adoption. Understanding these limits better will inform economic planning: if whole categories (like creative arts or advanced caregiving) remain human, that provides areas to channel labor . Governance and institutional innovation: Public policy scholars should design and test new institutions – e.g. how exactly to run a social wealth fund democratically (Norway’s fund is technocratic; Alaska gives dividends but citizens have no say in fund management). How to involve citizens in AI governance so that deployment aligns with public interest. Perhaps experiments with local digital currencies paying a civic UBI, or cooperative platforms that share profits, could be trialed at city scales. Convergence and Divergence Recap: We note that despite ideological differences, there is a growing convergence on certain basic tenets: the need for broad-based distribution of wealth in an automated era; the importance of lifelong learning and adaptability; the necessity of environmental sustainability; and the value of international cooperation to manage global tech and capital flows. Divergence persists mainly on how radical the change should be (reform vs overhaul), the role of the state vs markets, and normative views on work. These divergences can actually be healthy, spurring a plurality of experiments – some regions might try a more market UBI model (like a “capitalism with a dividend”), others might try more state-driven approaches (“AI socialism”), and we can learn from both. In conclusion, Post-Labor Economic Theory sits at the interdisciplinary frontier , pulling together threads from macroeconomics, political economy, ecology, and sociology to weave a new social fabric. The edges of this theory – the boundary conditions – force us to confront fundamental questions about what the economy is for . Is it to maximize output, or human well-being, or freedom, or sustainability? The answer must balance all of the above. Automation gives us the tools to potentially provide a decent life for all, but using those tools wisely demands foresight and humility. As academics and policymakers, we are in the early stages of charting this journey. The coming decades will likely bring political struggles and social movements focused on these very themes: campaigns for UBI or reduced workweeks, fights over resource control, debates on AI rights and regulations, and new solidarities among those left out of the old economy forging a new one. • • • 22 This research paper has attempted to map the terrain and highlight where bridges need to be built – between disciplines, between nations, and between the winners and losers of technological change. The hope is that by identifying the pitfalls (economic collapse, ecological overshoot, social implosion) we can avoid them, and by recognizing the potential synergies (technology with equity, leisure with purpose, abundance with sustainability) we can strive towards them. In the end, the post-labor economy will not just be an economic outcome but a choice about the kind of society we want. Ensuring that choice is informed, inclusive, and just is the task before us.
